Didn't think Co-op would be this stressful. Also worried about trying to look for a job in the spring for no real reason...
"A stress I always find myself undergoing is that I feel scared of falling into ""bad bitchwork jobs"" for my coops. All of my friends seems to either have better jobs or keep saying ""at least you have a job"" and I am grateful for the opportunity to get work experience but at the same time I feel like I could be going for more. Am I thinking incorrectly? Not even sure what to do to net a better job."
"Feeling stressed out. My job hunt is not going as well as last term, even after an excellent co-op job, and everyone else in my class seems to be getting multiple interviews for great companies. Motivation is hard to find, and I am desperate that one of the outside Jobmine jobs I reached out to will get back to me. The happiest moment of my past week has been receiving a software interview with a company that I just threw a resume at randomly. Even doing other activities makes me feel guilty. I liked helping set up the Boulder Comp, but I felt so guilty that I was doing that instead of studying."
Enjoying the last week of barely holding myself together until midterms cause a breakdown. Yay deeply rooted anxiety!
I need to start going to the gym again.. I can feel the sluggishness setting into my brain
God I have no idea how long I can still keep my sanity. I've been depressed for almost all of my life and it's just getting worse and worse. One of these days I might just take things into my own hands and hurt someone or myself I don't even know.
"So been struggling with depression and alcohol for the past few years. Just when I thought things were getting better, one shitty day just seems to send my life into tailspin. I wish it were as easy as one good day bringing me back out of it, but that's not how it's worked so far in my life. This is actually me talking post graduation too. School is not even a stress anymore and I'm still fukt"
"Let's see. i wonder if anyone else is like me. Mondays are awful for me. I have 2 three- hour lectures in a row, and for some reason, I spend the rest of the day freaking out over my assignments, and I feel super useless cause I haven't done all my assignments... This would be a problem if I wasn't freaking shit over assignments that are due in a week or 2.. I do not know why, but on Mondays, i just freak shit about assignments that I have a long time to do, and they are always done by at least 2 or 3 days before due date, so I have no clue why I freak out.. but I do..."
"I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour, but heaven knows I'm miserable now."
"Seeing my team regularly, even on days when I'm feeling particularly introverted, keeps me from descending into the darker depths of my mind. I've kissed depression once and it was the most terrifying thing that ever happened to me. I cannot imagine the horror that my friends with ongoing depression face in their lives, but I fiercely admire them for still being in the fight."
Just wondering what you guys think would be the best way to support a friend going through depression and other mental health issues? IÍm trying to be a good friend/ support person but IÍm not too sure what to do
The idea of me ending the term by hanging myself in my dorm gets more real every day.
"has anyone ever just been.... pretty much physically unable to bring yourself to finish an assignment?? like, i know that i should finish this assignment, or heck, even start it, but i just cant do it for some reason?? and i like hate myself for it but i cant really stop... ive also been holing up in my room a lot and havent been able to make many new friends and some days i go without talking to people. does anyone have any tips?"
"I am sooo burnt out, no motivation to study for midterms/do assignments anymore. My entire life has just been so focused around school this and school that. But I am so close to the end, graduating this winter term, so I don't want to take a term off or anything. But how do I adjust myself to spend less time on school and more time on stuff I actually enjoy and most importantly be okay with it? It's difficult, I have always pushed myself to do the best I can in courses. My MAV is like 86, so nothing special, but at this point I feel like I don't mind if my grades drop if it means I can spend more time on other stuff. But obviously that is easier said then done, I have to undo what feels like 30 years of pure dedication to school, and now I'm just trying to be okay with taking a step back?"
Anyone else starting to feel some serious burnout from midterms+coop? X_X
yesterday was the worst day of my life.
Last week I posted that my mental health was the best it's ever been. This week it's the worst it's ever been. Ripperoni.
"I'm planning the big day. I don't have anyone to see me off though, which sucks."
"I might be drifting off to sleep a lot but sometimes I feel trapped in a sort of half dream state where I'm living in a world that seems like this one, but isnt real."
"I'm just done. I try so hard to put on a smile and be there for anyone whenever they have problems, but at the end of the day, I always end up in my room having a breakdown without anyone knowing what I'm going through."
"Life is short and you never know what might happen. If you can, try to reach out to people who you have fallen out of touch with. You might regret not doing so someday."
"still spooked about my exam from last week tbh, if I fail I might unironically drop out"
"so much brain fog today, can't focus on anything"
"I highly recommend Maniac on Netflix. I binged it over the weekend and it hurt me on a personal level, but I resonated with it so much I cried after every episode."
Gonna mix 6mg of Ativan and a bottle of vodka to drown my sorrows
I have to leave the university because my country is having a financial crisis and our money is devalued severely. Life sucks.
too scared to check my marks :(
"one side of my brain is saying stay positive, u can do this, it not the end of the world if ur term sucks but the other side is like u goofd mate, ur dumb and u can't change that, ur future is doom"
"IÍm still waiting for a few of my grades and my anxiety is building a little. IÍve also been talking to this friend and while nothing is actually going wrong, IÍve been trying to make an effort to hangout but they are always busy. Like I know they have other things but I guess IÍm just upset because I starting to feel sidelined and undervalued. Sorry, just had to get that off my chest."
Wonder if I'll even be able to get through the term lol
Anyone suffer from OCD that manifests in some form socially? Don't want to go in details right now but am curious if anyone's OCD pertains to pretty much when around other people or other social situations.
Bought some apps to help me adopt a better lifestyle. Will see how it goes.
I've been doing my best to stay positive and happy this term and I am. I just feel that I might crash very soon and fall in to a depression spiral. It can be very exhausting to stay positive
I feel really wholesome these days - there's about a month left of work and I think I'm pretty productive which is a big part of my self validation. Excited for all my offstream friends to come home after exams in ~2 weeks and to go back to school in the fall :)
"Despite having three finals in the next ~week before the start of exam break, I'm feeling strangely positive about my ability to get everything done. Seems like therapy is helping me get my shit together, although it may be too late to salvage one of my classes (quantum phys)."
I signed up for SafeTALK suicide prevention training i hope i can keep it together and not break out in tears
What are some coping techniques people try when they are feeling stressed or anxious?
Im so stressed out from school that it is hard to leave the bed. I keep having nightmares so i cant have a deep sleep either. __
"As someone who has battled with depression over the past 6 months and is finally starting to feel better, here is my advice to anyone still in pain. Talk to a therapist. This is the single best thing you can do. I was suprised how much my mood was affected by simply voicing how I felt to someone willing to just listen. Legally they cannot share what you tell them with anyone (unless you are a serious danger to yourself), which makes it a lot easier to share with them than a friend or family member. ix your sleep schedule. Outside of therapy, nothing has been a better boost to my mood than a full 8 hours a night. Exercise. Doesn't matter what, just get outside and move. I personally go out at night and run while listening to music. Depending on your area that may not be the safest option, but there are plenty of other ways to get active. Diet, this is the one where I have seen the least immediate results, but they are definitely there. Drink lots of water, eat lots of protein, some fish once in a while.You may hear this stuff all the time, but that's because it works. You just have to be consistent. I know that may sound impossible, because I've been there. You just have to do a little bit at a time. Maybe run once a week, maybe drink an extra glass of water every day. Eventually you will start gaining energy and you'll be able to make bigger and bigger changes. And trust me, it does get better. I know I never believed that when I was depressed, sometimes it would make me angry, but oh man do I wish I had listened."
something I was WAAY too emotionally invested in just ended in a pretty painful way and I lost all my motivation to do anything (even know I have a shitload of work)...I think i'm going to take a day off to get my head straight. Anybody has any tips for what to do to not feel like a complete shit?
Someone pls kill me
I think I'm ready to be productive again after an eventful fortnight on leave. Bring it on!
Being sick and trying to study for exams sucks :((((
"Realized that I have, and will likely continue to isolate myself from other people, hindering my ability to make friends and ruining any current relationships with people in my life."
"Currently sometimes just donÍt want to the work, especially weekend. This is not what I was when I did undergrad. I need more friends to hangout or generate a small community. Study group is also a pretty awesome idea. Currently, I might not speak for a whole day, thatÍs not the way I want my life to be. Is there someone who is very outgoing and would like to make new friends, I would like to make friends with them."
why is life so sad my dudes?
I just took an off semester because I was burnt out. I'm now back and I really like my courses but I'm also really scared because I feel like I forgot stuff when I went home.
"I thought I had a good plan for this term, but I was very mistaken. I don't like my program nearly as much as I used to, my employment prospects are grim, and I just feel trapped in a life I thought I wanted :/"
"Finally getting a handle on my finger picking issues. I'm going to a wedding on Canada day weekend, and I'm not embarassed to go for a manicure :) I wonder if I have PMDD. I felt at an all time low during the week before my period with really awful intrusive thoughts and anxiety, and it's kind of a pattern. My family doctor is too far away for a proper diagnosis and idk what I'd do anyways if she put on that label. Not something I want to handle with medication anyways. I kind of would want to talk to a psychologist again but the wait lists are too long and I'm not even in Waterloo."
My cat passed away yesterday. I am so sad :( I don't feel like I can really talk to friends since I don't think any of them would understand.
"I think I should start seeing a counselor again. I haven't been to one since Gr. 12, instead I've been trying to ignore everything or push it all down until I can focus on something else. Unfortunately I don't think that's a good way to tackle PTSD.I'll probably go to Counseling Services for an intake this week. For those of you who have been there, I have one quick question. Are the counselors here OK with blunt and graphic descriptions of what's bugging me? If not, do you have any advice on how to coat it so they're less put-off?"
"Had a really odd weekend that was both fun and full of other people's drama, which was really anxiety-producing. When I get anxious, I get in my head and really beat myself up. I had a really awful morning, and had a lot of trouble getting out of bed today. Had a really odd weekend that was both fun and full of other people's drama, which was really anxiety-producing.

I think there was another suicide today :(
"Co-op search has got me super bummed out. I feel like every time I tell anyone about it, that I'm just complaining or showing how incompetent I really am. It's all excuses, I'm actually just useless. This is the first time I just feel like giving up. I have no motivation for anything anymore. I leave assignments for last minute and just don't bother with studying..."
"Because of the suicide today, a reminder that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems, even if they don't seem temporary at the time."
The suicide today is really starting to get to me... I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but never really acted on it. I feel like they're starting to resurface again even though I don't really want to die.
"Did so much cocaine I ended up in the hospital. Luckily no stroke but blood pressure was 230 / 90 and resting heart rate of 190. DonÍt do coke it costs too much and just makes you want more coke. Edit: in medical terms systolic BP over 180 is considered a hypertensive crisis. The monitor freaked out the entire time I was hooked up and the nurse thought the machine was broken. Surprisingly, I felt pretty good the whole time."
second year is almost ending for me and I still dont know what i want to be in the future. I just feel like im dumping money down the drain for nothing and wont end up even graduating or getting a job I might like.
Feeling sort of overwhelmed with assignments and midterms this week. I also really hope I get a job this round because I just don't feel like writing more cover letters + applications for continuous :/
"Hey, has anyone who made an appointment with counselling services know how long the process takes for a non-urgent issue? I'm finally planning on going tomorrow, but I just want to know if the two hour gap within my classes would be enough time."
I have two midterms this week and a quiz and I can't help but constantly fluctuate between feeling extra stressed and being calm. __
I am just sleeping all day. Skipped one assignment and a couple of classes last week and will skip more classes this week. I can feel my life slipping away from my hands.
"When I was an undergrad, I suffered a pretty serious bout of depression for about a year, and another one later for about 3 months. I've been fine for the past 2 years or so, and I've graduated, but I'm really frustrated. I have 2 terms (one much worse than the other) where my depression really negatively impacted my grades. I still managed to pass everything, which was a miracle, but those bad terms are there forever. I really want to go to grad school, but my average is just below where it needs to be to ensure I get accepted and can secure funding. If I were able to ignore my 2B and 3B terms when I was really suffering, I'd have no issues. 2B probably doesn't matter since it's before the last 2 years that supposedly really matter. My 3B term drags my average in the last 2 years juuuuust below 80 though. I wish the university would do something for mental health like forgive people bad grades when they're battling depression..."
i got sick twice this term both of which i spent in bed. the first time i was so sick i really couldn't get out of bed and since then i've been super depressed.i'm barely functional and idk how to be happy again especially cuz i feel so painfully alone (and yet I don't really wanna hang out either) not a good summary of how i feel but i guess that's how bad it's gotten. i'm not even coherent anymore
Long term girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me recently. I feel depressed a lot of the times but I know life moves on.
"I've had some terrible anxiety complicating my sleep for years, but I started letting my cat into my room overnight, and now I sleep better. He cuddles with me at night and I wake up feeling rested because of my kitty."
I'm burnt out and the term begins tomorrow. I have to miss the first day cause of coop commitments so I'll not only be burnt out but also behind. Im so damn involved and I feel like I'll be a complete failure and bring everyone down. I've never been more anxious in my life. Everyone around me is enjoying their time off in between terms and I completely fucked mine. Im lonely as all hell and don't have time to actually form meaningful relationships with anyone anymore. The people I do make relationships with usually only happen during coop and then we disappear from each other's lives cause of stream differences. Why did I come here.
"Netflix really helped improve my mental health lately. As great and thought-provoking asæManiacæis, I find something light-hearted likeæTerrace Houseæmuch more cathartic. I haven't laughed so much in ages."
"Haha, I missed a deadline and haven't been to class in weeks out of shame. Why am I like this, goddamnit? Well, whatever. I've got my antidepressants and I might start taking double doses to overcome this sudden onset of despair and irrationality. Thoughts? I'm sure I can pull through this. If I can't, well... I just won't think about it, lest the worst happens. Oh, and if anyone has a TTRPG session (D&D, etc.) I can join, I'm always down. I dunno why, but I just work better when I've got a campaign to work on. Gives me meaning, I guess."
"I don't know why I feel so empty and depressed. The sun is out, I'm eating regularly, and trying to socialize with friends... I'm doing everything that's supposed to help but at the end of the day, I fuck around on my phone until it's 2am so I'm deadtired to avoid overthinking. I also want to slash my wrists but it's been 5 years since I've done it and I don't want to muck it up. I don't know what to do. My problems aren't worth seeing a professional for; why clog up the pipeline for people with actual, legitmate problems?"
Feeling sad
"Only recently did I realize how fucked I actually am. Didn't really think about it much before but, I have exactly zero close friends, I have opened up to people more than once, and after brief sympathy, they'll cease contact for weeks, Random strangers on the internet have been more supportive than everyone I know IRL combined. Anyone reading this who knows someone that might be mentally unhealthy: Please please please do not imply you want to help us if you're not willing to spend the time. When you say you're here to help then move on after a day, you're hurting us and not helping. You have no obligation to help anyone but please don't make it worse."
Already had a sub-par morning. This entire week is going to be rough.
"I felt unbelievably motivated yesterday. I was listening to some of my favourite nostalgic Bollywood songs, I found a scrapbook from my childhood, I finally dual booted Linux on my laptop, and I felt really hopeful for the future. It's funny how things like that happen every now and then."
"Over the weekend i felt so alone and depressed because i dont really have any friends here right now. I felt like a huge failure and i could barely leave my room. I just didnt want to exist. Also, i dont know how im going to pay for the next semester of school or even if my OSAP will go through. I have a major fear ill fail chem next term if i can even pay for it. Im just so tired of of it all sometimes"
"Feelin extremely stressed about school and personal and health things. Really looking forward to seeing a therapist for the first time tomorrow though, that's got me hopeful."
I need to fix my life pronto before it gets worse
Health Services doctor doesn't want to give me more trap meds because I'm too depressed. That is a depressing thought. Oh also my phone bill is probably through the roof because I keep getting international calls that I pick up accidentally. Whoops. On the other hand my antidepressassants are working! I haven't wanted to kill myself in a whole week lol
"Finally in that stage of depression where I donÍt even want to eat anything. No more binge eating to cope with feelings. With my appetite gone, itÍs Time to lose all the weight i gained from emotional eating throughout the years. Dream body here I come"
"Is there affordable, non-group DBT? I'm so sick of living my life black and white and I just want to get better."
Feeling the stress this week. Ahhhh
"Apparently the way I see life and think about it is not normal, and bordering on some spectrum of clinical depression. Ho hum"
"Just got a 62% on a paper when i am trying to keep my GPA above a 3.9 to get into graduate school. I am more than capable of doing well (and always have) but my anxiety and my thoughts seem to be plummeting my performance. This term is looking bleak in multiple courses. After 5 years at UW, trying to keep such a high average, work full time and volunteer I am extremely burnt out and have no self confidence left. My social life is non existent from trying to keep the high average (and working a ton of hours) and my family is a mess because of my dad's mental health. Trying to keep it positive but it seems hard to keep up with everything these days."
"I'm trying so hard to improve my grades (keeping up with lectures, asking for help when needed, doing readings/assignments) but it's not reflecting in my course work compared to those in my class who I know are scoring 80+. I hate university and what it's done to my self-confidence and idk if i'll ever recover from this. I hate school, and hate my life rn. Been here for 3 years and still don't see myself getting genuine co-ops, nor the grades I want, nor any friends for support.."
I have to set reminders on my phone telling me IÍm a disgusting fat pig to deter me from eating anything that will be considered cheating on my keto diet I wouldnÍt wish depression or body dysmorphia on even my enemies. ItÍs a struggle every day
"Being an incredibly shy and introverted person, I found it near-impossible to make friends in first year. The fact that I lived off-campus and missed frosh (was in New York that week for a wedding) was no help either. By the time classes started, everyone had their own friend group and I was just too scared to approach anyone. I stopped going to a lot of my classes afterwards and started studying from home. I'm going into fourth year now and my grades were actually quite decent from 1A-3A since I spent all of my time studying. In my last semester (3B), I started to really take in the fact that I was at the school for 3-4 years and had no friends. This made me a lot more sad & quiet, and it started to affect my academic performance. It's gonna be a looooooooong 4A/4B lol"
"Anxiety out the roof, two midterms today with 30 min between them, prof told us in class only chapters 1 & 2 were covered, wrote on learn yesterday that chapter 3 is covered as well. Panicking. Sad lyfe. More meds that aren't covered by the feds thingy prescribed to me. ""Yay"", I say as I watch my balance dwindle. Also broke up with gf; now have super awkward living conditions until she moves out Somebody kill me please."
"Went to a hackathon this weekend which provided a much-needed change of perspective. Something about my approach to life is not working, and it's become very obvious this semester that something needs to change; I'm way too invested in my schoolwork and I want to be aæhuman being, not just an assignment solver. So I've finally gone over to Counselling Services and made an appointment. idk how much they can help, but I'm tired of waiting for myself to mysteriously and spontaneously Get My Shit Together»."
This term really hasn't been great so far. It's the first time I've seriously considered quitting. I don't think I'm going to do it because it's not worth it but I just feel so burnt out and we're only halfway through the term. Midterms during the next two weeks are all probably going to be shitshows. And I have like 4 assignments due before November 6th. I have no idea how I'm going to get everything done. I just want to be done with school and move on with my life. I hope everything will be worth it.
"By reading all this comments I can only say that I can relate to more then three posts at least: body shame, no friends, fell lost, no friends, no support... you name it! I am an international student, that by luck was accepted at UW - since I'm waaay below average from anyone I've met. My grades are bad, I hated every roommate I had so far, and obviously don't have the money to live by myself. My project is something completely ordinary and I have no motivation to get up and so the shit I have to do. Back home everyone thinks my life here is amazing and that all that social life I had still the same. I have absolutely no one here. zero. Wednesday I will talk with the science coach and see if she can at least help me with time management and stuff like that... any one did talk to her? Does it help?"
I constantly feel too dumb to be in a cs program here. Like itÍs my second year here and I still donÍt think IÍm deserve a spot here when the people here seem like geniuses who study non stop (or donÍt need to)
iÍm super behind in my classes and even though i feel stressed out iÍve lost the motivation to actually do the work
IÍm kinda really sad but like I feel like IÍm just going through the motions. I have 2 midterms next week and I want to kill them but I just donÍt care right now. Hoping my motivation comes back soon.
"What flavour of hating life is the most ethical? Can't decide between giving up on life, taking courses I want that will likely kill me, and actually trying to get somewhere in life and dying in the process Why can't living be plausible"
"So I'm in engineering and am pretty depressed, I'm thinking I should switch to another school for something easier with job prospects like business. Is this smart? Or will I just make another huge mistake in my life"
and life continues to suck
"i havenÍt been doing great mentally and physically for the past few weeks and so i tried to take care of myself, but now i feel hopelessly behind on school work and the stress is making my mental and physical state get worse again help"
I seem to have developed hypochondriac tendencies (as a result of persistent pains that docotors seemed to discard) and I seem to be becoming less and less able to put them to rest. Reaching the point where I have an anxiety attack almost every week and worry about every little pain killing me. And of course stress only adds to that
"University has just really worn me down, can't believe we are like two weeks in and I haven't done any work. I just feel like I am falling behind but just can't get motivated to work"
"University has just really worn me down, can't believe we are like two weeks in and I haven't done any work. I just feel like I am falling behind but just can't get motivated to work. My family has always held me back from being happy. All I did my whole life was browse the internet and nothing interesting ever happened in my life. They never pressured me at all to do good in school, it was all me. I think I had potential, but my parents didn't raise me right. To top it all off, there is no point to life since I'm homosexual. I also have other mental illnesses and they just fucked me up over the years. I had a goal that I would kill myself before grade 12 ended, but that didn't happen. When I started university, I planned to kill myself after graduation. I don't think I'm going to wait until then. Tl;dr I'm going to kill myself, fuck my family, I hate my life."
