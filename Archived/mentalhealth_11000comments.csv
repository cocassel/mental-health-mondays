"Crossfit, and another personal enrichment goal (art, learn guitar, nonfiction book) some sort of goal to accomplish...... Then I try monthly to do something for a random person., this month paid for someone's gas, pay for car behind me at fast food etc... "
"FUCK mirtazepine. That shit nearly ended me. Im not kidding. It made my depression 100% worse. In my experience it was a 'depressant', not an 'antidepressant'. Its dangerous shit. If you're feeling worse on it, dont try and tough it out. Change meds. Now. "
"I can't diagnose you, but this sounds a lot like Bipolar. You might want to talk to a licensed professional. He or she can possibly get you on some meds and in some therapy to help you out. :) If you need to talk, I am always around. Take care of yourself."
"I do this a lot, whenever something stresses me out immensely or a situation makes me upset or feel hopeless I just contemplate not being here by any means possible, I would never do it but its always my firs thought to remove myself from a bad situation. "
"I have the same thing.  Part of it is associated with depression, but I was told that a lot of these types of intrusive thoughts are caused by anxiety.  It probably would be worth talking to someone if you are able to though as you may be able to get help."
"I meet and talk with my therapist through BetterHelp, actually. We have video sessions. Its been quite helpful for me, especially since I'm in a rural area with no real access to mental health care.

The ""messaging"" feature is just kind of an added bonus. "
"I've been kinda reluctant to talk about any recent problems at home with my therapist mainly because my sister is a minor but is leaving next year to go to college, and I don't want to risk anything, even though things are way better than they used to be. "
"If this is the first time you've been on your own and away from home then yes, its homesickness coupled with anxiety. 

Your campus should have a health department, and mental health workers who can help you get therapy and medical assistance if necessary."
"It really is. Makes it harder for me tell what is actually my feelings and is not :/ I hope we both can get through these frequent contradictions. I’d say my dms are open but I’m pretty boring and shitty at talking/texting, but I also won’t say no :)"
"Nah, the thing is, I used to feel guilt and anxiety thinking about violent thoughts. Now I dont, and im worried. Maybe i just got used to them, and they dont surprise me anymore cause I know they're nothing, idk. but my brain makes me think it. its fucked."
Okay. I was just asking because I've had vibration/buzzing sensations occasionally in my head before. Never my entire body though. You're gonna have to go to a doctor and explain this to them. They're the only one's who'll be able to diagnose you properly.
"School is making it worse; I would still not feel good if I were out of school. But I do feel so much BETTER when I am at work instead of school, or when I think about quitting. I just don't have any backup plan for after I quit so I don't know what to do."
"Since you said in the comments that you're in college, you could try asking student psychological services for a referral. You could also try calling psychiatry at a major hospital and asking if they have outpatient psychiatrists who take your insurance.  "
"Symptoms wise- Depression, anxiety/ocd, depersonalization, lack of attachment to anyone.  Personal life wise- i am unmotivated and feel desperately alone. Used to be on meds and quit all types of professional help /meds 8 years ago when i had ptsd and etc."
"The water is very hard where I live, and for the past week my showerhead was clogged and was only trickling water. It made my shower so miserable. As soon as I replaced the showerhead and took a proper shower, I felt a million times better. It was amazing."
"‘Numbers and science’ is about evidence based research. It’s the heart of healthcare and creating interventions that can be measured to see if they’re effective. Anecdotal is great, scaling up something that works for a large population is better. "
"Is the problem that you have to do things in sequence, or that you can't do B until you have done A perfectly? Perfectionism plagues many of us and it can cause us to shut down and avoid tasks because we don't want to deal with them not being perfect.

Even the sequencing of the tasks is a related form of perfectionism. You decided that things must be in a perfect order and won't deviate from it.

There are a variety of ways to help alleviate perfectionism, but it may be something else is going on here too."
"Well ADHD occurs when parts of your frontal lobe are under active and it’s been shown that neurotransmitters in the brains of children and adults with ADHD work differently than those without ADHD. As far as whether it’s a disorder, if it effects your ability to function, it’s a disorder. For example, everyone experiences some sort of anxiety. It’s linked back to our survival. But if your anxiety keeps you from leaving the house or being able to perform your job, that’s when it becomes a disorder."
"Its about looking at the situation and thinking ""why am I angry?"" And then when you answer that, reminding yourself that that's a valid reason to be angry. 
The next step is to talk about the anger. Displaying anger doesn't mean yelling or belittling or hurting anyone - those are actually unhealthy ways to manage it. Instead, it's about being able to have a calm discussion with someone where you can say, ""you did XYZ, and that made me upset because ___."" And if they don't listen, it's about knowing how to value yourself enough to walk away. Then you find an outlet for the residual anger, such as exercise or punching a pillow or something. 

When done properly, none of that should make you feel guilty because you can remind yourself that your anger is valid. "
"That's fair, some people have good experiences but I've heard a share of bad ones too, it's hard to find that rare empathetic ear so it's understandable people come away feeling frustrated and ignored. Keep trying with CALL and the GPs, unfortunately it does take a while to get anywhere with them, sometimes you have to push them a bit to be taken seriously. Other than some services only available in my local area, my GP directed me towards some online resources to look at in my own time as well:

Sorry I can't be of more help! I hope you can make a breakthrough with someone soon and find exactly what you need. "
"Yes I understand what the point of your idea is, to bring together employees as peer support in handling mental health issues. 

I told you personally, no, mental illness stigma still exists in the work place. I have a bipolar diagnosis. That is even less accepted then the regular stuff like depression and anxiety. So if there is even a small chance my personal information could effect my work no thanks. 

You then mentioned connecting anonymously with other employees to which I said Reddit. What I mean is there are already a lot of online discussion support groups that are 100% anonymous. So the idea of the other person being another employee is nerve wracking and not an appealing idea to me, and I would prefer to use the anonymous chats available already. "
"First, I wanted to say that it's amazing that you're trying to be the best friend possible for your loved ones. I think the most important thing is that you take the time to care for yourself, too. Are you doing any type of therapy for maintenance? Even if not, I personally find it helpful to refer to self-help workbooks from time to time to keep up my symptom management. I can give you some recommendations if you'd like. Also, I think it's important to learn and know your limits. And don't be afraid to set boundaries with others. This can be done in a gentle, effective way. Lastly, to the best of your abilities, try to accept that things are the way they are now, and that change is inevitable and that it will not last forever. I'm sorry that you're going through a stressful time right now. I think it's very brave of you to reach out and want to do the best you can in this situation. Best of luck to you, let me know if you'd like book recommendations or if you'd like to discuss any of this in further detail. "
"I doubt she is planning to take your child away! But rules for being a foster parent are rightly very strict, as the children often have a lot more needs and/or difficult behaviors than average and have already come from tumultuous homes, not to mention all the legal issues that would ensue if something did happen to the child. I say this as a former foster child. 

I think, though, that you are right to have told your therapist. Even in the case that you cannot foster, it is better to have sought treatment and be doing better, then to be still struggling and have a foster child. No matter how it ends, being honest was the right choice.

Even if you end up not a foster parent, you can still get involved in helping at-risk youth, whether it be volunteering for a foster care review board or as a CASA worker (if you are in the US - unsure of other countries’ equivalents), doing a Big Brothers/Sisters program, working in an after school program, etc. Kids need positive role models both in and out of the home.  "
"I agree with this completely. I was suicidal in college (still in college though), and finding god had nothing to do with me getting better. If I didn't know my best friend for 10+ years, I would've been a goner. Her reminding herself that what my mental illness was making me do was not what I MYSELF would do... then she would've given up too. And if I didn't have anyone around at all that would believe that it wasn't ""just me"", then I would have people that hate me and not people that love me. You need to remember that your daughter, who used to be ""such a good girl"", is still your daughter. And she's still a good girl. And she's dealing with a lot that she can't understand, can't express in the right ways, and she doesn't WANT to deal with it anymore. And she wants it over with because she hates herself, and now everyone in the family seems to hate her too. I promise you that your daughter doesn't understand what is going on in her head, as much as you seem to think that she does. And clearly, you don't understand what is going on either. But in the end, if she wants to kill herself, and you're set on the idea that she IS a burden, then you're never going to see your good girl again. She's still there, but there's plenty of things happening in her brain chemistry that are manifesting in very bad ways because she doesn't know how to cope. 16 year olds don't know how to cope with having a hard class at school, without mental illness on top of it. People with mental illness don't know how to cope with their mental illness from the start, no matter what. Imagine having the magnitude of her mental illness, AND the lack of coping skills that a normal angsty teen would have. And then you calling her a burden because of it. Your daughter isn't going to get better if you don't advocate on her behalf. She's not here right now, her mental illness is. And instead of standing up for who you KNOW your daughter is, a good girl, you're further separating her from herself by completely blaming her for what she's going through. "
"hey,

your post was very sad to read. I'm sorry you are struggling so much with everything. I don't even need to know you tell you that are absolutely NOT a failure. Everyone has potential and capacity for greatness, but sometimes we just get a bit lost and don't know how to access that greatness within us. Everyone also has the capacity to improve their lives, no matter how difficult their external circumstances are. It's discouraging when everything seems so shitty and your life just seems to be accumulating in shittiness, but it doesnt have to be that way forever, dig deep and find your inner strength, your real worth. You seem to focus more on your weaknesses- things you suck at or don't compare to others, (living at home, no car, no gf etc) rather than what strengths or skills you do possess. Even if you suck at everything (which is unlikely)- many skills can be learnt, even if they aren't innate. So what is stopping you from learning and growing? it's not gonna help if you wake up everyday and remind yourself of all the things you suck at, they may be true, but it doesnt mean you need to focus on it regularly to further bring yourself down. Focus on things you are good at, skills that have the capacity to develop, start with small goals, baby steps, even if its something very minor like just cleaning up after yourself or taking care of yourself in some way. No one can give you all the answers, lay it out for you, or make your life better. YOU are the only person who has the power to change your life, you have the power to focus on your strengths, manage your weaknesses (but don't feed into them), you are the only one who can decide what you will pursue, only you know what goals you have. So don't talk to the person who has the power to have a better life in such a harsh manner (yourself!). Don't label yourself a failure and loathe over the things you have not attained.

Also, whats with the burning hatred for random people who are mean online? Theres some pretty horrible people out there, and no matter what you do, they'll always be horrible and nasty. Dealing with them is BAD energy, negative and hateful. Don't surround yourself in that kinda energy. There's people that have been through horrible shit, and mistreated their whole lives- yet have so much love to give others. Thats the kinda people you wanna be around or pay attention to. (even if its online.

Btw Comparison is VERY unhealthy and harmful for anyone's self esteem and well being. The world is unfair,once you accept this without any bitterness, you may feel a lot better.  Some people are born lucky, and some are born into shitty lives, but our external world does not determine our destiny. You underestimate how much power you actually have. If you are open, look into resources available for people struggling with mental health. I find TED talks or goal cast videos to be incredibly inspirational. Not in a way that compares, (my life is still better than theirs etc) but it really proves that humans are so resilient and powerful. As are you. I wish you the best of luck. I hope you start treating yourself with more compassion, because you really deserve a chance at life too.

"Are you okay? This sort of behaviour, and the consistent pattern in your other comments indicates that you are targeting certain communities intentionally. Do you need help? This is a supportive community, so if you are respectful, we will be glad to help. "
"Being comfortable with their therapist may be a prerequisite to opening up for a lot of people. And not everybody needs to get out of their comfort zone to address the issues they’re trying to address in therapy, that seems to be generalizing quite a bit."
"I always am focused on what the person says; there is no panic. I remember what the person told me, but I don't seem to interpret what people say the way that they intended. I guess it could be described as trouble processing the information?

"I do not advocate for self diagnosis or too much self reading, but besides PTSD you should look up [CPTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder) which may look like borderline, but is very different from it and ""normal"" PTSD."
"I do sessions over zoom.  Works pretty well. Just important you have real life physical support with you as well even if it's a massage therapist, or a support group for those days things get stirred up and you need someone to help share the feelings with. "
"I feel your pain. It’s exhausting enough battling mental illness, we shouldn’t have to battle being taken seriously. I am working on building a community for high functioning people to support each other. Would love to get your perspective. r/MentalGold"
I had this issue when I was on Zoloft.  I talked to my Dr at the time about it and made a plan to change to a different medication.  Most important thing is that you continue to discuss your concerns with your Dr to find the balance that works best for you.
"I have attended a DBT group as a support with my wife for her younger brother who lived with us. It is an amazingly helpful way to change your perspective whether you have BPD or not and I'd highly recommend looking into one with the way you're feeling, OP."
"I think that if you are still attending school, you should see a mental health provider or counselor there. If you have to, print out what you wrote here and give it to them or read it to them. They will give you resources and will be able to help you out. "
"I think the best thing you can do is turn yourself into the police. You are a danger to society. I believe you are a troll, but even so, you still seem to be not a very good person down to your core since you also seem to be a racist from your post history."
"I unfortunately can’t afford to go private. I feel like a brat meaning about free healthcare, but I personally think I’m having to wait far too long and it’s worrisome seeing as mental health is involved. I’m sure the months will fly by, though. :) "
"I'm 28. I had colleagues from pizza delivery join the mental health team that aids me within a short time.

I've got my own career now, everyone's doing something. Don't feel bad about yourself, feel bad for the people who are worse than you and help them. "
"It sounds to me (40 yr old f) that you have a LOT to process and heal from. Please consider speaking face to face with a counselor or therapist. 

Anything can be healed, just need the right method and time. Don't give up, whatever you do. Life gets better."
Mindfulness worked for me when I had a guided meditation with my therapist who was very well experienced in it. After that it helped much more and I was able to reach it more easily.  It does take patience. And practice if you don't have a pro helping you.
Once again your saying all this from your perspective. Which I think is a bit skewed because your in Canada and I've never heard of what your talking about here in the US. For example here in the US I'm fairly certain you are allowed to get a re-diagnosis.
"Thank you!!

I try to be understanding of their views and circumstances... they’ve been raising me since they were 16 and they definitely didn’t have it easy! But I would think that would be all the more reason to be supportive of my educational goals. "
"That's really good for her and that you're there for her. Social anxiety is a horrible thing to deal with and you definitely are right about therapy, it's a great step. Hope she get's the type of therapy she needs and can build up some confidence over time."
exactly! like if anything understanding and accepting it has only hurt me more and made things harder for me:( i don’t know it’s a tough one.. i’m in the uk and theres just not enough funding so they will turn anyone away that they possibly can ��
"For sure, why would they? My friends know I struggle to be honest with them (being authentic is the most impressive thing out there) , so I just casually slide it in. 

""Ugh, I'm so tired. I can't believe it is only 9:30. I relapsed and woke up in a pool of vomit. It sucked. Is Kyle coming in late today?""

They key to successful high functioning is admitting all your secrets, but still being willing to do the uncomfortable work while accepting that which you can't change. 

I do better some days than others."
"I want a general feel for the family and to know what they hope to get out of working with me. You'd think after 2 years this would be pretty basic, but this is the first time I've set up and attended one of these meetings myself. Normally my supervisor is with me. Also, the longer I work here the more I feel like I don't know what I'm doing. I'm constantly being told that I'm doing a good job, but every time something like this happens (new client, new group) I feel like I'm about to be exposed as a fraud. "
"In my state at least (USA), property management companies have a form for accommodation requests (If they don't allow pets you can request a pet) You and a medical doctor have to state that the animal alleviates symptoms and then they are (pretty much) required to accept it. They'll require vet records and other info, but can't charge you pet rent or anything like that.

I did that with my last cat and I'm pretty much about to go and do it again because it's something that 100% helps me function in my house."
"Absolutely fascinated by your story, I can only imagine how trippy and unsettling those experiences could've been especially as a child.

Although I have never experienced it myself it sounds very similar to panic attacks I've experienced before bar the obvious Macropsia. Just curious, but have you ever experienced sleep paralysis? I feel like that can be similar again but with different kinds of effects on visual perception. I only ask as that is the closest I could possibly relate to this experience and sleep paralysis is absolutely terrifying so I can only imagine AIWS must be really hard to deal with.

Also when you spoke of the time and sound changes it really really reminded me of the effects Nitrous Oxide can have on the brain when used recreationally."
"Heh. Interestingly I have a very similar experience in relation to a ""church"" cult group. They certainly don't self-identify as a cult, and I don't really believe anyone there is going out of their way to be awful, but that doesn't lessen the harm or the years it took me to de-condition my brain. So basically, your experiences are valid regardless of whether your abuser knows they're abusing you, and please don't lessen your symptoms and never ever think that you're to blame for them. Psychological abuse is very real and when you tie religion into that it gets incredibly messy. I spent so many years of my life trying to untangle what I really believed from what I was conditioned to believe. 

If you need anyone to talk to please don't hesitate to message me. "
"First off, I salute your courage putting yourself out here, you deserve kudos for this important first step in admitting the problems you face.  You're human, remember that you deserve to be treated like one, even by yourself.

Second, come to terms with what you want, it is YOUR life.  No ambition?  That's OK if that's what you want.  Want your SO?  That's OK to admit that.  Like actually write this stuff down, let it out of your mental bandwidth a tad.  In fact a small hobby like that is usually great for finding your way in all this, for finding what you do want to apply yourself in and where you're okay with not doing so.

Third is if you can afford it, make a comfort space outside your room, even just for the novelty, get moving to places outside of your grind right now, to set aside some ""fuck it time"" where you can be yourself without all the bullshit, even for an hour or so at the rec center or a coffee shop.  Change a route to one with more nature in it, I found that helped a lot for me.

&amp;#x200B;"
"From your comment to my post and this one, it seems that your brain has made some very harmful associations to normally usually annoying (people not understanding you) and good (things being well) experiences. When I was going through my shitty situation crying helped calm me down temporarily but it did not end the problems I was dealing with. 

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I think will definitely help you, it all about rewiring your brain into thinking differently and being in an overall better state of mind. 

On the insurance side of things, there is a possibility that your insurance may not be in-network for places that you are looking for, but may be out-of-network. From my understanding, in-network means that the therapy center will be payed by the insurance company and then all you need to give is a co-pay, while out of network means that you pay fully up front, but you can submit a claim to your insurance company for reimbursement (with mine it is 80%). Even though you pay upfront for out-of-network, the therapy center might send in the claim paperwork on your behalf, that is what my therapy center is doing. 

I'm glad your boyfriend cares and supports you, it seems he understands what you are dealing with, having a support network is really important. "
"I don't think it's a problem with feeling the emotion. I work hard to process the trauma. I let myself grieve the childhood I wish I had. I let myself feel whatever I need to feel, and I practice being very compassionate and understanding of myself and those feelings. I obviously work to regulate emotions when they would be innapropriate, but I make sure to revisit them when I have some time alone. 

For me, the issues that keep coming up, are I have a very deep inability to trust people, and I have a lot of self destructive tendencies. There's the logical side of my brain that can recognize that the people in my life now are good, and genuine, and supportive. And then there's the emotional side of my brain that's afraid of everyone. I communicate that fear to people, and they're understanding of it, but I can never make it go away no matter how much they prove themselves to be trustworthy. Also, I have all the tools and coping skills to avoid self destructive behaviors, but it's still where my brain defaults and I'm always actively fighting with myself to avoid it. 

I feel like I'm constantly stuck in this internal battle between my own head and all the therapy I've received. The therapy hasn't fixed any of the core issues, it's just put a bandaid over them. "
"Basically all the things that are so hard to do in depression...I always felt like my classes were mocking me, haha. Exercise &amp; social/cognitive stimulation is so important but I couldn’t hear it at the time. The weed prescription was an artificial happiness booster that showed me that I could actually see the world differently and interact more positively with it. A game changer that convinced me to finally attend CBT &amp; take my meds responsibly. It’s un-fucking believable the difference a year can make. I burnout of school two years ago and pushed everyone away and couldn’t even get out of bed to shower. I had NOTHING, and now...life is beautiful again. When I’m alone I will often will want to yell &amp; scream &amp; die, but when I go out into the world...well suddenly it’s energizing instead of draining. If someone told me this last year I would’ve told them to go shove it but I’m just really fucking blunt about my issues bc neuro helps me understand that it is not laziness &amp; not my fault for having a poorly wired brain. I’m VERY open about my issues and people have responded very well &amp; have opened up to me a lot in turn. Suddenly, I feel understood, heard, and no longer alone. You give a little, and suddenly ppl are eager and willing to give back. I don’t know if any of this is useful. I want to study mental health in social work after I graduate. I don’t know. Self care is everything and I really hope u give yourself that chance. It’s hard and slow &amp; gruelling &amp; shit but it fucking gets better &amp; my cognitive functions have IMPROVED. I’m not as capable as I was before my crash (struggling with a reduced courseload), but I have INTERESTS &amp; am able to reciprocate people’s affection and friendship. Positive feedback. Was any of this anything? The concerta is still new for me, too, lmao. I’ll go through my neuro notes eventually &amp; dig some stuff up bc it’s complex but it’s really comforting to better understand the mechanics of my depression/OCD "
"There's a lot to digest there. From a physical and pharmaceutical perspective I'd say the effects of weed last minutes or hours and wouldn't rank as high on the scale of dissociative drugs as things like LSD, Shrroms or Salvia, but I can understand the concept of a bad experience triggering or reinforcing a negative pervasive thought.

I suffered a fairly devastating relationship collapse in my early 20s and tried burying it. I had never touched drugs at the time either. I was the one guy in the group who was totally into fitness and thought weed and smoking in general was dirty.

Long story short I tried some weed. To be fair I tried it 2 times and nothing happened. I couldn't give in.

Then one night after a party I took a deep drag and a few minutes later I wasn't in the room anymore, I was in another room. It looked the same, but I was sure it was a dream.

I couldn't tell time, I wasn't sure of myself or my reality. I'd never experienced this before.

I can laugh about it now, but I found a pen and paper and wrote a note to myself that said if you can read this in the morning, this really happened.

So for a while after that I'd have some weed at the weekend. I was a straight laced guy and kept down a good job.

Unlike the ideal of the wasted stoner I never let it take over, i partitioned it to when I could afford it.

I never saw anything negative. I still don't. I used the experience to gain some headspace. I was able to draw back from my day to day life, and the trauma of the breakup and relationship collapse, and ask myself what was I doing, where was I going and was I happy.

In stark contrast to your own feeling of fear or anxiety over dissociation, I used that feeling positively to gain perspective.

To be honest, it sounds like you are suffering from anxiety and need to seek some professional help.

You've got some weighty issues there to think about like time and the nature of reality, which philosophers struggle with as well, but I would urge you to speak with someone as the underlying reason your fixated on these concepts appears to be anxiety.

Here's a high level piece of information on what you might be going through.

From a brain point of view the reality you percieve is reconstructed in miliseconds from when it actually happens, kind of a buffer lag.

Think of how many times you've been listening to someone speak and you get distracted for a second, then someone asks you a question. A lot of the time you'll go ""what?"", or ""pardon"" before realising what was said. This is just your brain processing that audio information slightly slower than visual cues.

If for any reason, be it stress diet or an actual illness, you find this dissociative effect happening regularly, then please don't be too vain or stubborn to seek help.

There is no shame in it."
"I had psychosis for the first time recently in hospital. I think what it feels like i would very much depend on the type and nature of delusions/hallucinations. I know some people have grandiose delusions where they may feel they are very important and I imagine their experiences would be very different from mine. My delusions were called 'persecutory' - where I thought I was being persecuted by the people around me, usually as part of a conspiracy between them.  


I started off getting very paranoid and wary of people, when i completely broke from reality it was really frightening because my delusions were about the people around me colluding to hurt, disfigure and kill me. Before that I thought I could hear people doing and saying things (particularly saying thing) unpleasant to me and made lots of accusations - my overriding feeling was of frustration that people *didn't understand*. To me, them telling me these things weren't happening was because they weren't listening, or lying or didn't get it. I was also confused a lot with really confused thinking and couldn't concentrate, was really jumpy and constantly reading into everything i overheard or saw (comments about other people I assume were about me, nice things said to me were interpreted as sarcastic and mocking, leading me to be quite sarcastic and rude in response). Some of my hallucinations involved seeing things in third person (might be the wrong expression), in that I was walking down a corridor past people saying things to me - but that corridor didn't exist so on reflection i may have been simply staring into space imaging this and coding it as 'true' in my head - I'm not entirely sure! It was undoubtedly the most terrifying episode of my life. I ended up assaulting people as I thought I was defending my life.  


I was already in hospital but most of the support was medication related. After i stopped attacking people I seemed to 'settle' but was in reality still very frightened and paranoid but did not voice this as much, it was internal - so it's always possible the only clue to someone's psychosis is being unusually quiet and secluded with unusual/odd behaviour.   


I was told I was psychotic at the time but didn't believe it until i recovered! The result was a lot of embarrassment and guilt about this. I'm several weeks recovered from this - still on antipsychotics and I'm doing ok (started university today!). I have a lot of trauma from my psychotic episode that I'm struggling with but hope to get help soon and have some residual paranoia that is being watched but I have insight to!


For support I would say, be patient - they may act hostile or frustrated towards you when you're trying to help but remember the reality they are seeing is completely different from yours and so there are usually internal reasons for this.  
Be reassuring, be on hand and let people know you are there to help.  
Try and identify 'early warning signs' and intervene early on.  
After acute episodes, be aware that it may take quite a long time for all symptoms to go away and even after this there might be resulting trauma and anxiety. Just because someone is no longer psychotic doesn't mean they're recovered in all ways. 


I hope you stay well and can avoid developing it but it's such a great idea to be proactive to learn about it instead of avoiding it. It's great you want to support other people in your life with this. As someone only just recovering from a first episode, it's great to see someone trying to understand something usually so stigmatised and avoided.

*they not hey. Both were for depression. I have considered it myself but my OCD makes it impossible to be an inpatient in hospital and I am pretty sure my depression stems from anxiety so I would prefer to target this and I doubt ECT can do much for anxiety.
"Could be OCD, but if I were diagnosing you, I would list it as unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder because it doesn't sound like it gets to the extremes of full  blown OCD. That being said, definitely worth talking to a professional about. "
Hi. I don't have any illness (at least not a formal diagnosis) but I struggle with my attention and memory. My therapist also recommended first before even talking about seeking psychiatric help that I see a neurologist. I guess it's just to check ? No idea.
"How should I go about explaining it to him? I don’t see him again until the end of the month. Also, should I wait another session or 2 before asking again? I mean there’s a possibility he’ll bring it up probably asking if I’ve thought about it more. "
"I am on Lexapro and it has worked very well for me! 

I’m sorry to hear about your nausea. :( I know many people who have tried many different medications before they found one that worked for them. Don’t give up! I hope you find something good for you. "
"I legit thought ""just fucking Google it"" when I responded, but I'm a lazy fuck. Sorry mate.  That seems like a shitty burden to put on top of a situation that's already shitty. You have a soul of steel to walk around and keep going, I know it can't be easy. "
"In my unprofessional opinion, you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which, as previously mentioned, is abbreviated and commonly known as OCD. Also after reading a second time, you may have a hint of Paranoia to put a little icing on that OCD cake of yours."
"It depends upon how severe your anxiety is. If it's too much then you may have to consult a doctor and he or she will give you medicines to control it. If it's less, just do something that makes you calm.. be it gaming or walking or anything that you enjoy. "
"It’s hard to say without more info, but you’ve mentioned some symptoms (diagnostic and other common behaviours that aren’t part of the diagnostic criteria) of borderline personality disorder and possible aetiology as well. Best wishes with your future "
"Make a diary of every positive and happy moment that you experience and when you’re feeling depressed and get in a negative headspace, look through the diary to remind yourself of all the happy moments you’ve had, it might help motivate u to keep going x"
"Oh I know. Recently one of them escaped out the front door. We got called out and were searching for him with security. He ran out of his hiding spot and tackled the security guard. Surprisingly, as frail as he looked, it took two of us to get him in cuffs. "
"The fact that he cried in front of you is a good sign and your words say how much you care -- that is already a lot. Maybe do some reading about anxiety and panic so you can understand better, but generally keep listening and being open to hear his feelings."
"i’m like this pretty much every night, extremely rare that i put my head down and actually drift off within like 2 hours despite how knackered i am, ASMR is a life saver for me, it’s the only way i can actually go to sleep without lying there for hours. "
"sounds like PTSD-related or induced dissociation triggered by possible panic/anxiety disorder. as cloudsofdawn said, mindfulness, DBT are good, also CBT and ACT (cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy). Maybe interpersonal therapy"
they're largely overpriced. Note you shouldn't be falling asleep with a weighted blanket on its not good for you. I'd try possibly making a homemade weighted blanket before throwing a large amount of money at one. Or check places like etsy for handmade ones!
"Are you also seeing a psychiatrist right now? Because they'd be able to prescribe you medication that should help you. I would recommend talking to one if you haven't already. There's nothing wrong with being on medication. Also, see if it's possible to switch to a different therapist. Therapy is good but it sounds like your current therapist isn't very helpful. And if you do switch, just make sure that you're completely honest with them about how you feel. That's the only way that they can help you properly."
"i’m dealing with the exact same thing and I honest to God thought I was the only one, well far and few anyways.

if I wasn’t so overstimulated mentally already I would be crying hysterically right now to see that there are far more people dealing with this than I thought.

out of curiosity does anybody who has experienced this also have the same thing happen with your dreams? I get so jealous of people who talk about their dreams and refrain from talking about mine because I feel like I’m making shit up"
"&gt; I'm just confused as to why she is doing all this.

You may never know but I would suspect her age is playing a big part in this.  I use to work doing the books for a senior living residence and your story was fairly typical there.  Management was always getting calls about ""the little people"" who lived under the house and were stealing things.

Whenever one is trying to help a family member who is unwilling or unable to seek help on their own, my advice is to join a mental health support group.  They are for family and friends.  There you can find what resources are available and more importantly, you can commiserate with others in a similar position.

Its only a suggestion but in the US, I would suggest that you contact your state's Department of Aging."
"This makes so much sense. I've felt similarly when seeing a grad student or young therapist because they're too close to me, and are in a place I wanted so badly to be (and almost was).  It's not so much a feeling of jealousy as it is a painful reminder of the things mental illness has taken from me. 

So I don't see therapists younger than me right now. Just like I wouldn't see a therapist that I was attracted to, because it would be distracting from the things I'm really there to work through (but maybe this is something you really need to work through).

Absolutely talk to her about it, but if you feel it's preventing you from opening up or getting the help you need, you might want to consider finding someone else who is a more neutral fit. You can still work through this feeling with another therapist, it just won't feel so raw and difficult. 

Also just want to say that a lot can change in your early 20s. 4 years is still quite a difference in such a transitional time. Everyone is on a different path at a different pace and what's right for one person might not be for another. You may have had more adverse experiences to overcome, or other complicating factors, than she did that kept you from being where you'd like to be. It's not because you're a ""loser."" "
"There are a few options he can seek for the time being until he can enroll in his employers health benefits.

* A lot of Universities have training clinics that offer free or low cost sessions with a graduate student training to become a therapist. Just because they're in training doesn't mean they are inferior either, they're often closer in age and more relatable, and have the most up to date training and information.
* Online services like Betterhelp to Talkspace offer the ability to talk to a therapist through text messages
* Community Mental Health Centers are also an option for low cost therapy services
* If you or one of your family members are employed with a company that provides EAP. It's possible that your brother could use your EAP services for a short period of time. They usually offer from 3-8 free sessions with a therapist, with the option to extend for x amount of sessions if you call and ask for more. Before I was on my employers health insurance plan I used my girlfriend's EAP.
* There's also apps such as 7cups, which don't connect you directly with a licenced therapist, but you have the ability to chat with volunteers who are very helpful and more than willing to listen.
* And lastly, a lot of times if you ask, therapists will give you a lower rate if you're paying out of insurance. Some therapists have a sliding scale that they will charge their clients based on what they can afford.

Hope this helps and that your brother can find something during this limbo before his health benefits kick in."
"I'm going to first respond by telling you that I know exactly how you feel, because it is how I have felt for most of my life, and I'm much older than you are. I've always felt like I was underperforming, always like others were doing better, were more successful, had nicer houses, had more achievements, were more popular. You name it.

I learned over time that this is a very common experience. It is so common because society encourages it -- through parental expectations, the media, and so forth.

You feel inadequate, so let me address that from two angles. First, practical, second, philosophical.

First, even through the lens of judgment you are using, I think you are being too harsh on yourself. What are your accomplishments? You did graduate from college -- not everyone does. You do have a job -- not everyone does. You have self-awareness enough to understand the need to budget and enough discipline to live on a modest salary. I am sure you have many more positives than that.

You say you feel a lack of purpose, but your words sound to me like someone who knows what he wants. You are trying to get jobs but you don't have enough experience. That means you have goals. You lack experience but you have a job, so you are getting experience, even if it isn't in exactly the area you want to be in.

Now the opposite angle. Would you consider reassessing the premises that underlie your judgment of yourself? 

""Underperforming"" -- This is based on an assumption that there's some sort of standard, or some level of ""correct"" performance, or that ""performance"" can even really be measured in this context. 

There isn't. You are only you. You are not anyone else. The right level of performance is whatever your best effort is. If you are doing your best, you are not ""underperforming"" except to a standard you have applied to yourself. That standard almost certainly came from parental and/or societal conditioning. 

If I told you about my personal situation, you'd probably say I was successful. Yet I've considered myself a failure for most of my life. I have a prestigious degree and many of my classmates are business leaders and authorities. Some are multi-millionaires. One is a very high-level executive at a company so large that I guarantee you know its name. My career and life are much more modest, and so I've felt like I ""underperform"" for nearly all of my life.

The mistake I have made is trying to judge my life and my value by comparing them to those of others. I am not others, I am me. There is no race here, no competition, no standard of performance. There is only living life to the best of my ability.

You haven't made a mistake in living your life. Like me, your only mistake is comparing yourself to others and assessing your value or performance by how it measures up to that of other people. 

This is a mistake that takes some time and effort to correct, but it can be done. But first you need to consider even the possibility that it is a mistake. If you can do that, you'll be decades ahead of me -- it took me far too long."

Diagnosis is not always important; symptoms are. Meds and seeing a therapist will help no matter what your official diagnosis is. Symptomology manifestation leads to better medication choice rather than arbitrary diagnostic criteria (studies have shown this)
"Have you tried guided meditation? I never really felt like I was getting much out of it until I tried it, and haven't looked back since. It takes commitment and practice but it definitely makes things better. I use Headspace every day and highly recommend it."
Heartbreak sucks. I know how it feels to go through it. But all you can do is try to move on to the best of your ability. It'll probably hurt for awhile but you'll eventually heal. You just have to decide whether or not the pain is worth still being friends.
"Helperdroid got your back

Yeh, I think we all feel that way from time to time. But if these thoughts feel invasive or persistent, or if they start feeling like something you'd really consider. Please don't hesitate to talk to someone. My DMs are always open."
"How about the family of the police officer who’d kill you, who would have to handle a depressed father/mother/husband/wife/etc because they learned that they just killed someone unnecessarily. 

Stop and think about how your actions affect those around you."
"I have Scandinavian heritage, not that it is important, but that is just kind of neat. I am sending you lots of hugs tonight. I am sorry you feel so crappy and this woman you love sounds amazing. If it is meant to be, it will. Take care and keep your head up."
I know many people joke about being pyromaniacs so I bet that made it extremely hard for people to take you seriously. I'm so happy for you being able to take care of it safely! You are an amazing person because not everyone would bother to try to control it.
"I'm not sure what you mean. By energy you mean how active I am? That's what we mean in my language when we say energy like that, and if that's what you mean then no, surely it has changed now that my feelings are all over the place but when it all started no."
"If you're feeling you're in a terrible situation, any hospital will treat you and bill you later. That's much better than the alternative. You also may be able to get on SSI(am I thinking of the right one?). You'll have a low, albeit steady paycheck for life."
Images or fantasies about burning things is something you can live with.  As long as you don't actually have any intent to start fires for real.  It's definitely a good thing to bring up with your therapist so they know it's part of what you are dealing with.
"It depends on their BMI honestly.  If they are severely underweight, then they would be considered as having Anorexia Nervosa.  If their BMI is normal or above, it is then Bulimia.  But it also depends on the circumstances surrounding the behaviors as well.  "
"Never ween yourself off anti depressants without soaking to your doctor first. 

Also nevermind what people think of you in the short term, concentrate on you and when you're better your family will be able to tell. Unless they are supporting you through it. "
"No one is suggesting this, but if you able to, it might be valuable to talk to your parents about seeing a therapist.  Or perhaps talk to your school counselor. If you are at university, many schools have excellent (free and confidential) counseling services."
"Ok. Like I said, enjoy it while it lasts, but keep an eye on yourself. There are a lot of red flags here. Do some research on bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar 2. Try to get at least 6 hours of sleep per night. See a doctor if things start to get weird. "
Realize you have nothing to worry about. Do you know what I am doing right now? I am riding my bike along Route 66 to California from Missouri. I am doing it because God allows me to. He wants me to inspire others to believe in Him. So they can be happy too.
"Stop beating yourself up, man. Nobody gets sick in a vacuum. It’s gonna screw up your life. Your manipulative behaviors will hurt people, and those people will think you’re evil. But that doesn’t mean you are. And it doesn’t mean that’s all you are."
"Thank you so much for this. I needed it. My boyfriend killed himself on Sunday and I’ve just entirely lost myself. I have nothing to say, I’m deferring my nursing job I’ve worked so hard for and I’ve moved back in with my parents giving away my flat. "
Thank you very much for this. I’ve always been unsure about medication because I’ve been worried that I’ll get to the point where I’m scared to stop taking it. But I think I need something to lift me and motivate me back into everything I used to do.
"Don't be embarrassed.  However bad you are, she's heard worse.

The good news is, you feel safe enough on reddit to talk here, and that's a plus.  If you had to deal with this all on your own with no words of support, it would suck more.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't beat yourself up.  Say to yourself, ""I have a hard time talking about my problems in person."" Not, ""I'm an idiot"".  Even if you were an idiot, I'd be rooting for you to feel better because even idiots are deserving of feeling happy and loved."

"Idk what country you are in or what healthcare plans are like for you but in my university you could only see the therapist 8 times. It was such a trauma for me to open up to a stranger and then get kicked out after I finally felt okay opening up-it did way more damage than good. In retrospect, I had health insurance and should have gone to see someone professional in the ""real world"" outside my university. I know for some people 8 sessions could be fine, but given my background it was not helpful to me at all"
"Paxil is another SSRI so as long as the dose is comparable you should be okay(ish), although the 5 day gap isn't ideal. Going straight from one to the other isn't the best but it can be done by a doctor who knows what they're doing with the dosages because they both work in similar ways.

That doesn't mean you won't have any discontinuation effects, just that they should be far less than if you stopped without any other medication taking its place. Keep in touch with your doctor though if there are any issues."
"Then you're definitely going to be bad at it for a really long time. The whole point is that we don't really take much time to just experience much of anything. Play around with what methods you try. Anything can be sensory. Consider what senses you tend to be more focused on and use that to your advantage. If you're a really auditory a person, try listening to ambient noise or picking out just one instrument in a song. If you touch everything you see, pick a smooth, fuzzy, or textured object to be mindful of."
You should seek out help. Killing yourself or hurting yourself is never the answer. I know it seems like it is but it just creates more problems for the ones you love. I’ve been there. Life is hard sometimes but it’s also so beautiful I promise it is. I know you may not see it right this second but it really is. I went through post history and say you scored well on your ACT and I’m sure you’re stressed about that but I got a 21 and got into a top ten school. You’ll do great things I’m sure of it.
"I think this is an okay post here as any. first and foremost, i'm glad you're safe. 

I can't say much, but wow this was intense. this seems like a severe personality or mood disorder. something was definitely up mentally. 

my little sister hid knifes around the house and threatened to kill people. she's a lot better now but it was kinda scary. she was diagnosed with ""Conduct Disorder"" and ""Oppositional Defiance Disorder"" but this sounds so much more severe. it could better severe harmful OCD, or a form of a personality disorder. definitely abusive and i'm really sorry you had to experience that, but there's something there, as scary as it was I imagine, going on mentally. 

i'm not fully educated but I was interested to read this. again i'm glad you're safe. "
"I took zoloft for about 8 months. It put me into autopilot. It didnt work. I didnt feel like myself. I've gone through several meds, but one thing to remember is how most of them work. They block the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine, they dont create more. Meds aren't a cure all, but drinking is not a good combination with meds, especially those to help with mental health. The meds aren't always going to make you feel better, you cant rely on them to do that. You have to work on yourself some too. You have to work with them. Taking sometime to just zone out might be good, but clear minded. Try meditating or yoga, something to help relax and breathe. If you're into the idea possibly a therapy animal, something to give you a routine to keep you out of the rut. "
"Since we're both fulltime I can only get max 2 days without her (depending on when the coworkers who cover my shifts are available). 4-9 of us work in a 25'x25'-ish area. 

I've yelled at them to ""stop"" before, as I was heading to a meltdown and then had one. Didn't fizz on them. I've fought back when they've tried to tell me to do something I knew was incorrect. Which led to them screaming at me. (The next day they were told I was right by our boss) An ex-coworker would constantly call them out, and they didn't stop bugging them.

I think they enjoy putting people down, and feeling powerful. 

I just stand there and take it. Maybe I can try doing it again, it's been quote a while. It's hard to stand up for yourself, but there's nowhere to go but up from here. "
"As I always say to people who are suicidal on here: if you were 100% committed to doing it, you would just do it. There would have been no need to ""vent"" these feelings to strangers on the internet. And I'm not saying you're trying to get attention, I'm saying that you seem to want help. You aren't completely ready to die.

I can't stop you from committing suicide,and I won't try to give you hunky-dory messages about life getting better. It probably won't, to be honest. Life is awful, and it's fucking hard. I totally understand why you'd want to leave. I've been there for a very, very long time. The only reason I'm still alive is because I had a psychiatrist who decided to try something a little uncommon in terms of medication. She tried lithium, which saved my life and was really the icing on the cocktail cake of my meds.

A combination of medicine, therapy, and a sense of purpose has kept me around. Take out any of those things and I'd be a mess! It's a matter of finding the right combination. But it's a long and arduous process.

The purpose that I discovered was only through trial and tribulation. And it's more of a working purpose than a ""meaning of life"". I keep myself busy as much as possible. Or I sleep, lol. Sleep helps me reset my emotions. You gotta find little things like that to keep you sorta going.

But I'm sure you've tried many of these things. I think you should keep trying to discover these things for yourself and put them all together, ya know? I think, for your son's sake, you should keep at it. Adoption could be good, but it could also scar him in ways you wouldn't want for him :(.

If you need someone to just talk to, consider talking with me. I'm almost always at least moderately available. And it sounds like you could use a sympathetic ear."
"Honestly not at all. Everything about the experience is absolutely terrifying. There's something about it that taps right into the core of the amygdala. Sheer unadulterated terror. At least for me. I know others that experience the symptoms can variate on how anxiety inducing it can be, from not at all, to mild, to devastatingly terrifying. It's something to do with which parts of the brain is triggered, or so I've read. Sadly I'm on the latter part of the spectrum. So it's never been anything but incredibly difficult to handle. For years it was misdiagnosed as panic attacks (much to my protestation that It wasn't panic attacks). for me, panic is so intrinsically interwoven with the onset and episode that it would be impossible for me to garner anything positive from the attacks. And when I say panic, I mean the most potent form of panic. Fear for you life, sanity, desperation type of panic. Overwhelming waves of nauseating terror and something you really have to fight to keep from completely overtaking you while an episode is happening. It's honestly not something I'd wish on anyone and can be very exhausting.

If they never happened ever again and I forgot all about them, I would be very happy about that, and I'm hoping such a thing occurs eventually. It's been quite a while since my last blip, shall we say. I haven't had a full blown attack in over a decade, and only 3 sort of *wobbles* over the past long while, I'm hoping it's very much behind me by now. People with AIWS tend to grow out of the majour episode stage of things, and it seems to be the case with me. But I still frequently get momentary blips of things not fitting together properly for an instant, but that's really nothing in comparison to the kind of attacks I had in my younger years.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Hey there. I’m a 29 year old male, so I don’t know if my answer will be perfect for you, but after reading your story, I have a few simple pieces of advice for you. 

1) Find an outlet. I’m gathering you find yourself in time crunches whether they be self inflicted or as a result of life in general, but when your feelings get into your own head let it go. Is that paper due tomorrow and it’s midnight and ya just have to keep going? So what! Fuck that! Focus on you. Everything else is ancillary. If you don’t take care of you, who will? My favorite saying in life is, “look out for number 1!” Trust me, when you hit the adult world it’s no different. You’ll learn that employers don’t care about you. If you died tomorrow, the corporate world will simply replace you the following day or week and rarely give you a second thought. You’re your own biggest supporter, make sure you take care of yourself. More on that in a bit.

2) Don’t allow anyone else, parent, teacher, or peer force you to accept the conventions of society. Sounds like a lot of your problems revolve around school. I had problems too, not academically, but behaviorally. School, I learned after the fact wasn’t necessarily meant for me. It was important yes, but I simply refused to allow it to drag me down. I promise you, how you perform in high school or college will not define you. I graduated high school with solid B+ grades, joined the military, learned useful skills and then went into the corporate world. The biggest thing I’ve learned is, nothing in the past defines you. Can some things prevent you from certain jobs or situations? Maybe, but that’s the employers loss if they choose not to hire you. Basically, I want to make sure you know, don’t beat yourself up over an education someone else has told you is important. Learn, but learn about something that interests you. Done what you have to do to be successful in school but don’t spend every waking moment trying to perfect it, who cares! 

Invest in yourself. If school or life in general
Has you strung out, take a break. Don’t spend that time doing nothing. Watching a movie or sleeping isn’t doing nothing, it’s getting your mind right and investing in yourself. Don’t spend all your time doing that, but everything is good in moderation. Once you’ve recovered apply yourself for as long as you can, then take a break. 

Always pursue your passions and dreams though. If you don’t, what will your time have been spent doing? Most likely trying to achieve something someone else values or has forced you to believe is important. Look out for number 1!!!!!

I don’t know if this is exactly what you’re looking for, but I hope it’s a start. And that actually reminds me of one more piece of advice I’ll give you. Never be afraid of what others think. Need help and not satisfied with what you’re receiving push people for more, ask questions, engage people. If someone doesn’t want to listen or help,
Fuck them, find someone else, because there are a lot of people willing to give their time others. 

Feeling pressure to live up to others standards is also toxic. Live for yourself! Don’t worry what others think of you, and do what you feel is best. I’ve found that more often than not your gut instinct will be right. I firmly believe that people’s
Sub-conscience guides them. Trust that. It may not always turn out exactly as you’d hoped or be right, and if not, so be it, but always learn from that! Learn from everything. Something good happen? Think about what went right and apply that to other aspects of your life. Something go wrong? Grow from it, don’t let it define you, and don’t let it defeat you again. 

You’re 17, you’ve got a lot of time ahead of you, it’ll all work out. 17 won’t define you, just like 18, 19, or 29 won’t either. 

I know we know nothing about each other, but if it helps, know this. I believe in you! Had someone told me that when I was your age, I may have doh do success quicker than I did. Believe in yourself! 

If you need any more help, never be afraid to ask. Parent, professional, or otherwise. I’d always be happy to help too, simply because everyone needs someone to lean on, and help can come from unexpected places. 

Best of luck to you! And remember, I BELIEVE IN YOU! ��"
"So I'd love to continue this conversation, but I think a more important point needs to be made here.

Id really really recommend you look into the research behind Batterer's Intervention Programs. Specifically, the EMERGE and Deluth model. People like Lundy Bancroft.

For some quick context: While my office uses our own specific treatment model and formula, I am a certified trainer of the EMERGE model, and I run the research department of my office which publishes research on Batterer's Intervention Programs (BIP). I also run 3 batterer's groups every week.

There's a big misconception that domestic batterers abuse partners because of childhood abuse and trauma, and the newest research highlights that this just simply isn't a correct correlation. While it is sometimes the case, the majority of abusers (by that we mean successfully take power and control away from their partner through manipulate tactics) report little to no childhood abuse. Moreso, a large portion of people that do have childhood abuse report NOT being domestically abuse. Finally, there is newer research coming out of Minnesota that some abusers will even fabricate childhood abuse in an attempt to justfiy abuse.

If you'd like to read the research, EMERGE and Deluth have a ton of links on their website to these studies. Bancroft's book, ""Why Does He Do That?"" does a great job diving into the research as well.

The biggest reason for this is because childhood abuse is often physical/emotional abuse, but domestic violence spans a much broader spectrum. While some abusers learn that physical harm can take control through childhood, this is not where they learn financial, spiritual, sometimes sexual, and sadistic forms of abuse (these types are reported 80% in all abusers, the most of any). These behaviors are learned through a partnership where power and control is taken, feeding an internal need for control that stems from something else (sometimes childhood, but oftentimes an incorrect moral code, or insecurities about relationships).

Here's an example: one of the most common behaviors I hear from batterers is secretly putting a shared car under their name. Oftentimes they say they do this as ammo: if their partner tries to leave, they can threaten to take the car away. When asked where they learn this, they report learning from friends or figuring it out themselves. No childhood trauma.

In fact, it's very surprising how little time is spent on childhood trauma in groups. When BIP groups cycle through ""Abusive Behavior Processing"" (a CBT form of processing why they abuse), a lot of clients dont bring up childhood trauma (even when reported in intake).

This is exactly why newer BIP models have shifted towards accountability of abuse, rather than trauma treatment. While it's SUPER important to be trauma-informed (and of course we have to be as therapists), batterer's intervention therapists need to be mindful that their clients use trauma to manipulate their stories.

All that being said, I have a lot of clients that have childhood trauma. I've referred a lot of them to trauma-focused therapy like EMDR after they've completed group. But again, a lot of them report that their childhood abuse is unrelated to why they needed to control their partner. And research is saying the same thing.

The really crazy part of being a BIP therapist is this weird balance we need to have with childhood trauma. As our field moves towards trauma-informed care, it's really important that we don't let this harm the best way to treat batterers. I don't want you to think that I'm undermining childhood trauma. All of our clients take the ACES, and it's something we look at carefully. But we need to treat batterer's the best we know how. When we say that childhood trauma shouldn't be the forefront of BIP treatment, we're saying this with the best interests of the batterer. As a side note, BIP therapists can't forget that their clients have a victim attached to all of this, and our treatment hinges on the safety of the victim. Accountability tends to keep victims safer than addressed trauma. 

I hope this gave some insight to what I was trying to say earlier. Obviously this is a hard sell to mental health professionals with the booming shift to trauma-informed care. 

As for OP and her husband, obviously I can't know if the husband is abusive or not. I certainly don't want to say that he is. But I'm also recommending that he gets a BIP assessment, for the safety of OP. These behaviors could potentially escalate, and it would benefit the husband to really understand why he's doing this."

"I am afraid of opening up. I've never talked about any of my emotions to my parents, and they barely tried to talk to me about it, and when they did, I would just deny everything. I agree with you, and I'll try to do my best. 
Thank you for your comment &lt;3 "
"I had thoughts like that at 9 years old, and they scared me so badly, it manifested into OCD. 

When you have these fantasies (of stabbing) how do you feel? Excited? Disturbed? Neutral? 

You are honestly asking, so I am asking you to be honest with yourself. "
"I think you should have her referred to a therapist off base, the one she met with sounds pretty bad. You should also try getting her involved in art, it really does help you express your emotions when words can't, and it could be an emotional outlet for her. "
"I wake up at 6 am just to lounge on my couch, bundled up in soft blankets, and goof around in my phone. It’s weird, but having this extra time where I know I don’t have to stress out about anything and can just do what I want has done a lot for my anxiety."
"I worked in a home for peoole w autism for 10 years. Nothing that was done there helped them with their symptoms.
So what if you are autistic. If you dont have problems with the way you are and you are bot causing harm to anyone else whats the use of a label? "
"Its really sad that brain cells don't regenerate. When we were kids, my sister hit my head against a hard wood furniture corner, I probably got some brain damage on that day. Whenever I think about my brain endlessly bleeding into my skull I become nauseous..."
"It’s not that I seek solitude I just can’t find a way to not socialize without messing up conversations and relations and thus as a result end up in solitude. Though, I do find myself just throwing away relationships I “bore” which I hate about myself."
What sort of therapist did you see the second time round? I remember me and my therapist would talk about not rating counselling. But then idk if this was because she's offering empathy. Then again they do what they do because they support it and believe in it
Yeah I have tried really hard to convince him to go and some days he won't contest it but other times he will totally say no and put up a fight about it. I want him just to go on a regular basis because the minute he stops going it puts him back to square one.
"Yeah maybe.. It’s weird and quite annoying! Any recommendations on how to cope with the anxiety without having to take anything serious like lexapro? (ativan works for me but i know i can’t, well shouldn’t, take that daily bc they can become additive).. "
"Yeah, I'm still new to therapy. But, I feel like my therapist has been very empathetic but hasn't really gotten me to the root of the issue. 
I guess I want to ""fix"" it, but maybe that's not how mental health works lol. Do you feel like the therapy helped you?"
"You don’t need to get high or drunk to be happy. Those are just bandaid fixes and sometimes result in even worse depression. 

Try to focus on the real problem and fixing it at its root rather than drinking or smoking. 

Sincerely
 a former alcoholic/Stoner."
"Your dad's an ass. If you're under 18, you can get emancipated. If you're over, you can cut him out of your life. Surely your mom will come around if she has sense. (Mine didn't, she chose her husband.. but I'm cool with that). . I'd rather not have fake love."
"i dont believe there is a disorder. i think that you just havent seen how this disorders are really like. when i started reading about disorders i thought i might had schizoid pd, ocd, delusional disorder, social + panic anxieties. now i think only schizoid pd"
"sorry to hear that... and yeah I agree, women do often make things so complicated, it's toxic but my problem is that I jump back into toxic waste again and again cz I am addicted to it. Idk how to get out, I want to get out for a while to get my head straight."
"A therapist here. We hear weird things all the time. If you have a good and ethical therapist, they will not talk about you outside of sessions. Everything is to be held confidential. Unless your weird thoughts are a threat to yourself or others, therapists generally have no reason to ever talk about it with someone else. Even when I was in supervision and had to talk about sessions to get professional advise, everything was very generic to keep the client's information private. 
Hope this answers your question"
"Both yes and no.  
Depression usually makes your serotonin levels wonky, which not only makes you sleep less, but messes with your REM sleep.  


The fact that your REM sleep is being messed with actually makes all of this happen. Basically what happens is that even though you sleep 8 hours, you rest for say, two or three. Take this for a longer period of time and you will notice symptomps of ongoing sleep deprivation, the most well-known and obvious of which is short-term memory loss and lack of concentration."
"I can't tell exactly whether or not it's just being moody or something more serious. The only way to know for sure is to go see a doctor. And then you can get a referral from them to go see a psychiatrist. I would also recommend seeing a therapist as well. Even if you start to feel better, you should still continue speaking with a therapist. That way if things start to go bad again, you'll have that person already there to talk to about this stuff. Don't put it off. Otherwise things might continue to get worse."
"I feel like you are saying u/Ryaubee is only seeing things from a Batter's intervention therapist's angle.  But that is not my specialty and I can tell you that I considered what Ryaubee is saying.  OP's husband is definitely making a conscious decision to say those things.  I guarantee if OP started to respond to her husband in the same scenario with, ""I'd fuck him"" he would lose his mind in anger/jealousy.  Because the truth of the matter is that Batters are insecure and this would confirm his insecurities.  "

"There are different types of Bipolar Disorder. Type II is a less severe form, but can be very problematic in your life. What you describe sounds very much like bipolar disorder. You should know that all psychiatric conditions exist on a continuum from very severe to sort of mild, like any other illness.

Psychosis is a very severe symptom of Bipolar Disorder, but is not seen in all cases. You don’t need every symptom, nor do your symptoms need to be extreme to be classified as suffering from Bipolar Disorder."
"Yes, I should mention I’m so adamant about my opinion cause my whole life I’ve been surrounded by gastroenterologists with that opinion lol and have seen many cases come through their offices. Im not saying that heavy weed = this problem. I’m saying it’s a rare condition that can happen to heavy weed smokers, that the only time I’ve seen the condition has been coincidently smokers, and I just so happen to be a heavy smoker so I’m not biased against the idea of heavy smoking! Just, medicine you know?"
"Well...when I see a box of matches or a lighter, and all I can think about, dream about, fantasize about is setting a fire right then and there. I can smell it, feel it, see it...I totally get lost in that fantasy. It scares me because sometimes I will look around me to see what is flammable near me and what is not. That can be very worrying too, but I never act on these compulsions (not in public anyhow--when I am alone, I start fires all the time in a safe place I have)...but I can see myself doing it. Clearly. I feel so much tension before I actually do it, then when I strike that match, it is like the angels are singing or something. I feel so good and relaxed, and so satisfied to see that flame. I don't know if that helps, but I can definitely relate. &lt;3"
"Not being able to go to therapy as a service member or risk getting kicked out sounds extremely sketchy to me.
I have PTSD due to a lot of childhood trauma, neglect, abuse, etc. My dad was a soldier and alcoholic for the majority of his life. He became sober three years ago and is still clean. I started drinking, using drugs, physically harming myself, attempting suicide, and a whole bunch of self-destructive habits as a young adolescent. Now sober from self harm, drugs and alcohol (full year in November!), the main reason(s) I’m still here is therapy and healthy outlets. If you love music and art then maybe try getting into drawing or playing an instrument! My dad was absolutely obsessed with CrossFit and challenges like ToughMudder and Savage Race- even in his early 50s! Working out was an amazing way for my dad to get all the shit out of him in a healthy manor. This is hella cliché but it’s true: find things you love- even if it’s something small like the smell of pine trees- and make them your sanity. "

If you are entering a role that requires DV clearance, then I'm sorry to say that as things currently stand, schizophrenia and mania and severe depression are some of the conditions that will be likely prevent you from obtaining it.

"Just want to double down on some things that already were said. These sound like intrusive thoughts -- they just kind of pop up and are bothersome. Definitely talk to your therapist about them as they will be able to help you develop tools on how to manage the thoughts whe  they come up.

Another thing I want to touch on is your age and the effects of puberty. I'm not sure where you're at in development but testosterone is a hormone that takes some getting used to. I'm a 28 y/o person on hormone replacement therapy where I take testosterone. 

When I first started hormone replacements, I had to learn to recognize how it impacted my emotions. There were definitely times when I suddenly had intense feelings of rage, where I wanted to punch someone suddenly, etc. that to me felt like came out of nowhere. Talking to someone about these intense feelings helped me recognize the cause and how I can regulate and manage my emotions better.

You sound like a caring, loving person who recognizes and is concerned by those sudden thoughts and feelings. Recognition is the first step to developing and growing. Keep working with your therapist, seek other sources of support. /r/anger can be a good sub to post to occasionally for people dealing with similar thoughts and feelings. "

"Hey btw, I came back to try again only in another place, although its pretty tiring it is fun and I feel better just going.
Thank you for your kind words, the world is full of increadibly good people and you are one of them.
I hope only good things come to you."
I actually went through this not so long ago. The only thing that helped me was time and focusing on other things. It can be torture I know. You will get through it because I did. If it gets too overwhelming I suggest talking to someone about it. Hang in there!
"I wasn't sure when it was happening. I posted about it on schizophrenia.com and there was some doubt it was a psychotic experience. I think  that at a milder end of things what may , or may not, constitute psychotic thinking is a grey area open to much debate ."
"I'm sorry, but I'm gonna be the person to say, you need to get the gun out of the house.  Kids are very smart.  There's no locked enough for a situation like this.  Also, yes, he needs mental health care ASAP.  And I would strongly recommend family counseling. "
"I’m sorry to hear that, that is a very hard thing to go through.  It might be anecdotal but it’s very real for you, and I thank you for sharing your perspective.  There are always risks, I appreciate that very well.  Tons of thought goes into this for me.  "
"Oh, that's excellent! Hiding such a thing is too much to bear. I'm grateful that you can seek relief &amp; understanding from those closest to you who love you &amp; want you to thrive! I know I'm just a random redditor but know I'm rooting for you to succeed!!"
"Take a rational approach: look up the crime statistics in your area! Human beings have this tendency to attach great fear towards possible events that 1) have happened recently/near them and 2) have extreme consequences. 
I hope that made sense and don't worry!"
"When people say ""I want to die"" I kinda panic and get really concerned and caring, its somewhat embarrassing because theyre usually joking or not actually suicidal and I've just freaked out for them. Its frustrating to not know whether to help someone or laugh."
"Yo I tried to take a shower today and the water would not get even a little warm. I ended up washing my hair in the sink, so I guess I have that going for me?

But yeah, neglecting my bathtime is a huge red flag for me personally that my depression is acting up"
Yo! Thats narcissism! I have had the same experience with my  dad. I disowned him as my dad. Don't let his shit get in your head. That isn't love. That's straight up mental and emotional abuse. Do not let it slide. It prevents you from being who you want to be.
"use the time u have left in university to find a husband so u can raise a family, which is the proper role of women. i made the mistake of going thru university and graduating without finding a husband, now im 30 and alone because no one wants a used up old hag"
"But ones life feels miserable because you react to it that way. 

It’s true that you write your very own life story. Life is beautiful and it’s sad some people actually succeed with the suicide. Humans are meant to work to live a healthy mental life. Not saying it’s completely work, that’s just a part of it all. 

You need to work mentally, which I see many people struggle with. It’s hard. 

And physically which we see in everyday life. 

It’s all how you react and how you respond to it, simply put. "
"Honestly: it can be, and it can become a pattern/relationship dynamic that can be exhausting and verging on emotionally abusive if you're not respecting someone's boundaries about discussing this (especially with BPD, which is not something you mention).

If you are thinking about self-harm and worried you might act, a crisis support line or doctor are really who you need to be talking to. A friend isn't equipped to help you with this, and asking them to repeatedly can be very frustrating and draining for them. "
"Just remember, your trauma does NOT define you....and the best revenge against your past is to live better, and you can't live better if you disfigure your pretty self. 

I know life sucks sometimes, as I personally have PTSD, but you can't let it define you or dictate to you what you should or shouldn't do to your body.. 

Whatever you do, don't harm yourself, it's not worth it and if you harm or disfigure yourself, its a form of letting what brings you down win.. Stay strong, things will get better :-) *hugs* "
"Your good moods don’t sound problematic unless you’re not sleeping, risk-taking, experiencing some heightened irritability, behaving strangely in ways that cause others to notice...


Essentially, concerns should arise if the good moods are accompanied by uncharacteristic, eccentric behavior. 


The lows could very well be unipolar depression. You should consult a physician regardless if you’re experiencing discomfort or persistent periods of sadness that you described. 


Sending happy thoughts your way. "
"I agree with the other redditor and you. You need help and you already completed the first step admitting that. I'm proud of you! I know it sounds strange coming from a stranger but I really am. 

If you need us we're here remember that! The next step is opening up to someone. I know this is difficult you don't even need to explain everything trust me. Your still in school maybe they don't have counselors as you said? How about a teacher you get along with or feel comfortable talking to? I truly believe they will help you. 

Maybe clearing your heart to them will be a big relief already. I'm sure they will help you get the help you need! 

Don't give up yet. There's so much more you can do I've faith in you. We all need help sometimes but only you can ask for it."
"I am on Clonidine 1 mg once per day. It takes care of my anxiety pretty well, and therefore settles my Pyromania down also, which is triggered by stress/anxiety. I can only take it at night, though because it does tend to make me sleepy. I am waiting to go back to my Psych in a few weeks to get more meds added for the Pyromania and for Depression. I don't find that the med I am on changes me in a bad way. It helps me think more clearly because my mind isn't going 10000 miles an hour, and I don't feel all stressed out. I have been on antidepressants, but I didn't really like how they made me feel. Those are the one that made me feel like I wasn't myself. Hopefully you can find meds that make you feel like you want to feel.  


Hope that helps. Good luck to you. :)"
"I went through a manic episode and turned my life upside down. When I came off it I dove into depression. Crashed and burned, hard. Hit rock bottom. Those close to me already knew I struggled with mental illness, and were there for me. Other people around me (mainly co-workers, who I've known for years) thought, and some still think, I was pulling a stunt to make everyone feel bad for me and making up excuses for my previous behavior. Meaning my manic episode. Even through getting sober from alcohol and drugs, getting properly medicated, and clearly being in a better place, some of them (unfortunately a manager who is still fighting to have me fired) still think it was a ruse to drop to part time for a few months and ""clear my name."" Sometimes you just can't win."
"I went through this for years as a kid and preteen. It was absolutely awful. 

I had a rough time growing up and I was so stressed I gave myself stomach ulcers and daily nausea to the max. I’d scope out places to barf every place I went in case I needed to exit quickly/not make a mess. 

It was literally all stress induced. I am much much better after moving away from home. 

One thing that helped me was noting that smiling helps suppress the gag reflex. If I had to I would just smile hard. Always had water. Ate light meals at restaurants like salads. Restaurants especially overwhelmed me and I’d have to camp out in the bathroom. 

If you can see a doctor please do. They might be able to help you. Living this way was hell for me and I know it is for you too. "
"That could be it, but you're going to think of a hundred things that it could be to try and make sense of it all and what that can do is cause anxiety. That happened to me after a rough heartbreak. I was having realistic/stressful dreams which made me even more restless and depressed. Then after going through it all in my head, I realized that I had to just lay it to rest because ""it is what it is"" and I had no control over it. So after I fought that demon, I began thinking about all the things I could have done better. I got fixated on fixing my flaws because then ""maybe I'd have a chance to get back together with""...I had to go to counseling for that one because the self-doubt was a deeper issue. After getting past that...I started thinking of all the things I wanted to say to them. I just could collect my thoughts. What I decided to do was write a letter to them. I would write 3 pages and then edit/rewrite. I did this so many times until I felt complete. it helped me collect my thoughts and it helped me get past a lot. I never sent the letter and I haven't spoken to them since. I have given the 'writing letters"" advice to many friends during a breakup and many said it helped them collect themselves as well. Some did send it, wanting more closure. Just a thought!"
"That’s what I thought as well. I tried looking into Bipolar disorder and while i could see a little of the depression, its more reactionary than coming in stages. Always is triggered very strongly if a mild thing occurs. She jokingly says I am her savior because I talked her out of suicide 3 years ago. She used to cut a LOT. Im starting to think she isnt joking anymore though by how she raves about me and talks to me. I’d be busy for 5 minutes and she’d actually cry, saying she misses me like crazy and just endlessly thinks about me and how she can please me. I don’t hate her for it, I know she is unwell, but that level of attachment doesn’t seem healthy. Honestly it feels like I am walking on eggshells all the time. I’m consistently worried she will be more obsessed, or get easily upset if i say something out of line.

I’d love to help her with that in getting her help you know? She even has been contemplating from time to time if she needs help. Always saying she feels “off” and “not right”.

But I’m worried with how her mother views psychiatrists/psychologists, she will ban her from getting any help. The woman loves her but has her own set of issues and is very possessive of my gf, and I don’t think its healthy all this time she has prevented my gf from getting help

Lets say my gf agrees in getting help, what is the next step? Are there any people licensed to help with these kinds of things at universities for example? It’d be a safe way for her to seek help without her mother knowing"
"The last straw was finding out he sexually assaulted another girl at his school. We contacted the girl directly this time because both times he denied it and said he was scared of going back to school to rumors. She confirmed what he did to her but would not go to the police out of anxiety. We brought him to the hospital for psych testing, stating he could no longer be in our care because we could not control what he did to other people. He tried to manipulate people at the hospital, and eventually the state got involved to take custody of him. He was placed in a children's home, but is now 18 and has gone off to college. We haven't heard from him, but were told by his social worker that it was best to cut ties because his behaviors were very unsettling.  
My wife is now grieving the loss of her brother, on some days she has a hard time wanting to be alive. I don't know how to comfort her and cannot even sympathize because I am anxious of what he is capable of now that he's 18. I'm afraid he will be mad at her, thinking she abandoned him, and want to make her pay for it. I'm very worried of him being on a college campus. But when we attempted to express our concerns to the state and his housing, they said they would handle it. It took so long for them to take over when he was in the hospital because there are no resources for situations like this, so we don't know what exactly they could do for him. There are no intervention programs, people have to be set up for failure and commit a crime for anything to be done. There's so much more details to this situation, but I am trying to keep it light due to anxiety that he may somehow find out about this. I don't know what to do for my wife to console her and help her move on, but at the same time I just want us to be safe."
"Reading through your post there are some things I've picked up on that I'll comment on.

1. Weed sometimes has terribly adverse effects to those with mental illness and if you were already in a heightened state of anxiety due to your social anxiety than you were probably more at risk of the adverse reaction you received.  Weed can sometimes be laced by a supplier so you may have had a bad batch but your anxiety at trying weed/the effects of weed probably triggered your reaction and panic attack.
2. Your issues with relationships and the tendency to become dependent on partners and take a long time to recover from break-ups also stems from your anxiety.
3. Sometimes when we admit things we've been hiding for so long (your secret you revealed) we can feel relief but it can also trigger intense emotional reactions, especially if the secret was big and was taking up most of your mental time hiding it.  Now that you don't have to your brain is kind of in meltdown mode but congratulations on your drinking sobriety!
4. One known side effect of antidepressant medication can be an increase in existing anxiety and your clinician should have gone through this with you! I'm sorry you had a terrible experience but it can also take a long time to get the right medication unfortunately and sometimes you will have bad experiences but it can be possible to find one that will work for you.
5. Try to stop doing research for the time being if possible - I know it's hard, but it's going to send your anxiety spiralling.

It's good that you have some time off of work so that pressure is gone for the time being. I think the best thing to do is to highlight all of this to the psychiatrist when you see them and talk about your concerns re: medication.  I just think that having the anxiety for such a long time and not really addressing it up until now has resulted in this intense feeling of an existential crisis you are having but try to remain positive! You are getting help which is the main thing and hopefully you will see some positive results which will alleviate your fears.  I do think that talking therapy would probably be extremely helpful for you - I found both existential therapy and CBT helpful with my anxiety disorder.

Good luck on this journey - it's never easy to pull yourself out of the hole you feel you are in, but there are people who are supporting you and you're not alone in it.  It will be difficult at times but try to persevere and remain consistently engaged and you should see a positive change.

"By definition, I believe the biggest difference is the duration of each intense change in feeling. People with BPD tend to jump from emotion to emotion rapidly while those with Bipolar disorder are often feeling each emotion for a more drawn-out period of time. "
"Everyone I've talked to has been hesitant to try and define what my issue is. In fact, I don't think I've ever been assigned a diagnosis. I bet if you talked to a different person, you could get a different diagnosis. I mean, these things aren't black and white."
"I do agree with your therapist... although sometimes you can’t cut out your energy robbers and then it’s like “okay, so now what?” 

I try to avoid mine (and can do so) most of the day.... but the second 5pm comes around... cue the anxiousness and fear! "
"I feel you on that. Can you ask your doc to do the genetics testing? I heard sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, but it’s supposed to show which meds will work for you. I’m trying to do it myself. I hate playing this musical chairs game with meds."
"I'd suggest getting a full psychiatric evaluation done. Let the professionals listen to what you're experiencing and tell you what they think is going on. Especially since you've had impulsive suicidal thoughts, it's important to get a more thorough evaluation. "
I've helped plenty of people with their own issues of depression and anxiety but I don't have a pyschology degree or any training. I have had my own experiences so I know first hand. But I think everybody could learn how to help others with mental health issues.
If you can report her anonymously to the company you work for then do that. If you can't report to them anonymously then make an anonymous report to the police if you can/if that's a thing where you live as where I am that counts as a hate crime I'm pretty sure.
"Remember, **nothing changes if nothing changes**. It's up to you to take the steps to get better. Only you can help yourself, no one else can make you better or take the steps for you. I know you can do it, you just have to force yourself to take the first step."
Thank you! Yes I have a long list actually which is why I’m all nervous. I feel like they won’t be able to address everything or won’t believe me. I feel weird just reading it off and then I feel weird handing him my phone. I have social anxiety obviously
"These intrusive thoughts are really getting me down...

They won't go away. No matter how much I distract...they come back.

I had to start 3 fires already today (and it is not even NOON!) JUST TO SHUT MY DANG MIND UP. Screw this noise. I hate my head right now."
"Diagnosing mental health conditions can be tricky because some of them can look very similar and it’s not like you can just do a blood test or a CT scan to see what’s going on. Ultimately, I think your question of why it isn’t depression is something you need to ask the person who diagnosed you. He or she should be able and willing to explain their reasoning. 

At the end of the day, it’s not so much about what they call it as it is about making sure you get the right treatment for the symptoms you have. "
"First page of your comment history [by new] alone is enough. The derision and snobby attitude is enough for most people, let alone the superiority complex and hatred of men [apparently, by your Askmen comment, and the ones in Trufemcels].

&amp;nbsp;

""Truth"" or not, you bring that kind of negativity and general attitude to mental health-related forums and discussions, and wonder why people don't like what you say?

If you're actually studying Psychology, look in the DSM-V under Narcissistic Personality Disorder."
"I am so sorry to hear you are going through something so hard. Been there and I know how horrible it feels. 

Try calling a “Warm Line” - not sure where you are located but in my state we have a warm line where you can just talk to someone. This is you calling just to work through what you’re feeling with someone who has been through similar experiences. This means you’re not actively wanting to commit suicide. 

If you need someone to talk to also please feel free to PM me. I hope this helps. Much love. "
"I know the feeling, sometimes I'm just sitting there, nothing bad going on at all, I just start thinking about hanging myself from a tree or starving myself to death. I don't want to tell my friends or family because they will freak out. I don't think I'd ever follow through because I am very aware that it is my depression making me think like that, and I couldn't do that to the people I love. Therapy is something I've tried, didn't do any good but eat up a bunch of money. Been cautiously considering medication. "
"I may be wrong about some things in my post, as I don't know you or your family situation. However, strip down to the meat of what I said and remove everybody else but you, and i'm sure it holds a little weight like you said. No one is perfect, trust me, I know. But with every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around. Take Care. Get back to those kids. They need you.

"Not sure why they would transfer you...?? I mean, wherever you go, you take yourself with you, so that wouldn’t necessarily help anything. Also please keep an open mind about therapy. For the most part therapists are in it because they want to help people. And if it’s not a good fit you can always switch to someone else. A good therapist will want you to be comfortable, even if it ends up being with someone else and not them.

Any questions, feel free to ask me. I’ll do my best to help. Best of luck to you."
"You mentioned ""first girl"" (assuming that means to put your wife first), but hiding things from loved ones is a perfect first step into creating an unhealthy and one sided relationship. 

Have you ever heard of the phrase ""suffer in silence""? Bottling things up is only going to make things worse and add more weight on your shoulders. 

I'm not even going to mention that you suggested *lying* about important life events to arguably the most important person in your life. 

Good luck LayTheeDown, things get better."
"My mantra is this: I am going to assume that my old self and vigor and personality will come flooding back one day. There's no point otherwise so I am going to keep open the possibility that absolutely can happen.  It might be tomorrow, or next year, or in 40 years. I have come to terms with that.

In the meantime I will make a conscious effort to work on myself and do productive things so I am not completely wasting my time hanging about on this planet. I'll learn skills and crafts, I'll experience new shit, I'll volunteer and do things for my community. I might not enjoy the time doing these things, but I don't enjoy much stuff anyway, so no change there. At least when I do get healthy, or when medicine gets better or whatever, I have used the time productively."
"She had it coming. Ive put mine in the penalty box several times over the years for this kind of shit. Her, having shoved you out of her yang DOES NOT IN ANY WAY give her any special right or privelage to harass you. And what she's doing is harassment. 
My mother is in the penalty box right now for annoying repeated phone calls, she called a dozen times in less than 48 hrs, about half of them after 11pm. I phoned her back and told her straight up to not call me anymore, I will call her. She got pissy and hung up on me. I don't feel a damned bit bad about it either.
What I'm saying is you need to nip this on the bud, and be firm with setting boundaries. If she doesn't comply, cut her out for a month. It's gonna bug her a helluva bunch more than it's gonna bug you. "
"You and me both, friend.  


Denial isn't just a river in Egypt. I tried telling my psychologist friend this and she said ""(my name) you are a pyromaniac. The sooner you accept that you have a problem, you can work through it and get better.""   


Those words HURT. That was the first time someone actually confronted me with my illness, and it stung like a mofo. She is right though. Don't try to fool yourself into thinking you're ok...people will see right through that. It is best to be honest with yourself and let yourself feel what you're feeling. That way, you can heal from it.   


Now only if I could stop starting fires...sigh. We both have a lot of work to do, don't we, friend?  


Sending lots of hugs your way. :) My messages are always open if you need me. "
"You're not alone. I'm coming up on ten years since I was diagnosed, I think. I've taken pretty much everything they can throw at bipolar to zero success. Mood stabilizers make me irrationally angry, like to the point that I broke three toes by kicking some metal patio furniture across the yard in a rage. Everything else makes me so groggy that I can't drive or function at all regardless of when I take it. Can't be mentally ill if you're asleep, I guess.

I went off meds a couple years ago and only used marijuana at night to get to sleep and to calm me down. I tried meds again in the start of 2017 and lamictal was the same old rage song and dance with even more shitty possible side effects.

So now it's just me and MJ again. But, at least I'm not breaking any toes."
"And, like, do it *more* frequently than he does. And somehow more demeaning. 

""I'd fuck him in ways I wouldn't fuck anyone else.""

I'm just irritated. But OP the fact that he doesn't seem to feel your feelings are important is a red flag.

Next time he says you can't control him and demonstrates he does not seem to feel your feelings are important and is unwilling to communicate, start ignoring him more, spend more time away from him, spend more time with your friends, etc. Remove yourself from the hurt. When he starts to freak out after a couple of weeks be the broken record he was. Use his exact words. Make.it obvious. If he is being passive aggressive then you can be too. ""You can't control me.""

When the moment is right revisit that you want him to shut the fuck up about saying demeaning shit and that it breaks your heart when he does it every time. Let him know you are willing to leave if he keeps treating you like this (and be brave enough to do it if he is too egotistic and entitled to take you seriously). "
"I came here to say something similar! I’m a 26 y/o female therapist who recently graduated. I’ve had a client bring this up to me and we continue to work together. 

I agree you should work with a therapist you’re comfortable with. Research tells us that a good therapeutic relationship out-stands any method of therapy, so the relationship you have with you therapist is the most important aspect. However, I feel like it could be an opportunity for you to talk with her about how you feel and may honestly help with your process and whatever you’re going into therapy for. If you talk with her about it and feel worse afterwards or don’t feel her response was appropriate or helpful, you can always stop treatment with her and move on. She may really appreciate hearing from you about your true thoughts and feelings, because that’s what you’re seeing her for. You’re clearly self aware and recognize how this is impacting you, which is awesome! Do what’s best for you, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. "
"If you never had a stable sense of being loved as a child, as you grow, you start to question if love is conditional. That's how it got explained to me by my psychologist. My mum has a mental breakdown when I was a kid and she was t emotionally there for me, and I grew up babysitting her feelings and catering to her emotions. I stopped asking for help or comfort because I wasn't guaranteed to get them. 

If you were raised similarly, it's going to be very easy for you to find things to panic about in other people's behaviour, particularly your girlfriend's. Do you often panic that she's angry when it turns out she's not, she's just quiet cause she's tired? Do you get worried that she is angry with you if she's left a message on read, when it turns out later that she just forgot to reply cause she was busy at work? 

I used to be much worse than I am now, but I still catch myself asking if my husband is ok despite him telling me ten seconds earlier that he's happy and he loves me. Emotional abuse leaves deep scars. "
"&gt; It's a deeply inbuilt (from birth from what we can tell) part of the person's psyche so therapy doesn't work.

So it's like development disorders? What is the point of therapy if it can't fix the psyche?

&gt; You abuse the person for being one way and reward the person for acting differently, until their brain starts punishing them for acting ""wrong"" and rewarding them for acting ""right"".

Yeah, that's basically how my mind works. Split into a thousand pieces with no real core personality. That's fine. I just feel worn out.

&gt; The treatment for gender dysphoria is adapting the body, not adapting the brain.

I can't believe that making myself a freak is the only medically accepted treatment. I'd rather die. I wish this was a more socially accepted choice.

&gt; So your psychiatrist will not prescribe you anything as it would be pointless. They may however be willing to refer you to gender identity services who will chat to you about how you're feeling.

Yeah, that's what he tried. I already had some ""therapy"" and it was just not helpful. I'm sitting on a volcano and I need something to cool it down. I'm kind of left alone with this because there's no treatment. That fucking sucks. I just need some help to keep going. There must be some medication that helps."
"I don't think anyone can give you motivation. Motivation itself has become somewhat of a buzzword, so much that I'm not even sure it holds meaning any more. I'd say ditch the word altogether and stop waiting for willpower to just happen. I don't do the things I need to do to improve my life because I'm motivated, I do it because I know I should and I know I will be happier for it. I know it's easier said than done when you're suffering from depression/anxiety, but honestly I've found it so much easier to ignore my brain and just do the things anyway. Still when it's bad my brain is constantly whining at me whilst I complete my tasks, but that's all it is, just thoughts, it can whine and moan all it likes but I'm still going to do the thing. So all I can say is just keep doing stuff, just keep moving forward. Somewhere along the way your brain may catch up and things can start to become easier or more habitual.

One thing I find helps me is to write a list each day, 'cause sometimes even a few small tasks can really make my brain freak out over all the things it has to do. So I make the list and I work through the list, doing a little bit of each task at a time, with breaks and lazy time inbetween. Just keep your lists small and achievable and reward yourself after. "
"Your parents want the best for you. As soon as you tell them how you are feeling, and what you are going through, they will become your support group. 

Depression is a slippery slope. The longer you wait to get help the stronger the feelings of shame will become. Then your life will truly be more difficult. Getting depressed at your age is more common than you think. 

You can even get on meds without having to go through your parents. If you have a doctor you see regularly you can get them through them. If you don't have the money you can go to the mental health department. I found mine at the courthouse. There are programs that help people get the meds they need. The last option (and hopefully it doesn't come to it) is ending up in a behavioral health unit. Don't use this option unless you're really in need. 

Just say, ""Mom, Dad. I need to get on anti-depressants.  I've been feeling really down the last few months and I don't want this to spiral out of control."" Be casual about it. You don't want to scare them, but they need to know that something is not right. They will be more conscious of what is happening and will make a couple adjustments to make life a little easier till you're on your feet again. (Asuming you have a healthy/loving relationship with them.)"
"yeah I see where you're coming from, sorry! I meet some people through sites like Omegle on 'tags' and I think I'm helping them and we talk I get to know their other social accounts and they have a similar story here but I do like to make sure I'm not talking to a troll then I find out that, it's just disappointing. Says more about me than it does about people who self-diagnose, my narcissistic-personality-disordered (officially diagnosed) ex best friend once told me he had depression and was on meds and so was I so I opened up and he later revealed some personal things about it to my friends. Said he was sorry and he wanted help that's when we learned of his narcissism - now that one I could diagnose for him ;) - but also turned out he had severe OCD and needed meds anyway! So just surprises me how people can do that haha. 

Yeah I don't judge everybody the same I always think especially with anxiety and depression some people know they match the symptoms they just haven't the courage or confidence to see someone. Heck I got my diagnoses after going to the docs because of constant stomach ache! Shook my family a bit coming out with SSRI's. It was just on my mind and thought I'd ask if anybody had some insight haha. Guess I never got over the best friend business.  "

"Do you believe yourself to be without faults?  Or do you simply not want others commenting on them?

What do you mean by ""easy access to medications""?  Do they flat out say no or are there conditions which you are unwilling to meet?   That's not a judgement, btw."
"Hey update, I went into another place and actually did the class, it is pretty tiring, but I feel increadibly good after doing it, I will definitively come back.
Thank you a lot for caring about me as a complete stranger, I hope that only good things come to you."
"I can't...I'm smack dab in a city and there is an ordinance against open flame (not counting grills). Let's just say I have pestered my hubby to do almost everything imaginable on the grill just so I can help him light it...

I am hopelessly in love with fire. :("
I think you can see a psychologist if you are experiencing stress or anxiety. Go to a psychologist and they will most likely be very willing to help you because you are experiencing anxiety and/or stress. They can defiantly help you retrain your way of thinking.
"I will be seeing a professional soon (I hope). 

I'd like to think though my dissociation is from a lot of different things. At most it's because of how I grew up not having the proper social and mental growth. Ended up being a bit asocial and such because of it."
"I wish you and your brother luck. Maybe this is just what he needs. At least he will be in a safe environment with people who understand and can talk to him. I am a recovering alcoholic, so my heart went out to him, and to you. I am sending lots of love your way."
I would recommend group therapy. It'll force you to be around other people. And it should help you in regards to your people issues. The only way to truly overcome this is by forcing yourself into social situations. So group therapy would probably be a good idea.
"I've been having this for the last few months. I'll flex a facial muscle without thinking about it... But I know it's a form of compulsion because if I think about having a tic but try not too, my anxiety starts to climb. 

Could this be the case for you as well?"
"Its a sad reality m8, your closest family members may turn out to never have given a shit about you, and a stranger on the street could care more about you than the family member ever did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Expect the worst in people though, never be disappointed. "
"No, you aren't being overdramatic. It sounds like you may have depression. Believe me, I know what you mean. I felt the same way 3 years ago. The best thing you can do is talk to someone about it and let them know exactly what you're feeling. Good luck to you. :)"
"So I hear you, and you’re more than entitled to feel the way you do, but you shouldn’t scold people for being ignorant. Failing to understand once presented with facts is one thing, but from what I can tell the guy was trying to be supportive in his own way. "
"Thanks dude and yea me too, I actually felt super guilty telling her because I'm one of those people that acts the happiest when they're the saddest so it was like in a period of 24 hours she found out her happy daughter was suicidal, I felt like a piece of shit."
That sounds like something awful to live with. When I start getting obsessive thoughts I try distracting myself with videogames and watching videos/movies/TV but then I also find myself obsessively skipping through the video as if that somehow skips time as well.
"That’s crap. I basically dealt with that for 7 months. It really does break you. When you do reach out and no one answers, and end up snowballing to a suicide attempt, people ask why you didn’t reach out to anyone.

I’m sorry you have to deal with that too."
"What have you done in order to heal from your trauma? Have you sought professional help from a qualified therapist, one who specializes in trauma? If not, start there. If you have already, think about some booster sessions since you are reexperiencing symptoms.  "
"You might want to see if your doctor or therapist will add trazodone to your bupropion.. Currently I am on trazodone (100mg) and bupropion (300mg a day) and I feel calm all the time.. Nearly zero anxiety and emotionally, I feel very balanced.. I hope this helps! "
"You should try couple’s therapy. However, since I don’t know what those things are that caused you to lose faith in him, I can’t tell if this could be an unsafe situation for you. If it is, get out. If not, try couples therapy, and listen to your therapist."
"Thanks for this.  I think I generally understand.

&amp;#x200B;

The tough line I'm trying to tread is ignoring him for the sake of trying to set an expectation that I'm busy and not always able to talk, but also give him some attention so that he doesn't feel rejected/depressed/mad at me for not being there constantly for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you elaborate on your ""withdraw your attention and tell him when u are going to do that and why"" statement?  Any guidance is helpful and I appreciate your time.  Thanks.  "
You know believe it or not I do understand you. I'm on a lot of medicine right now and I've been to mental hospitals 4 times in my life. I never leave the house and I think that everybody is out to get me. I'm not going to tell you to go back because I'm not the person in charge of your own life. But you're not the only person who's going through problems similar to yours. Go through my profile. I've been talking to a lot of people who are struggling too. I want to help you get better but you need to let me first.
"Honestly if you see him like this, don't intervene immediately.  Gaming induced anger is completely irrational.  His response is down to a lack of self-belief and purpose, so he gets incredibly frustrated doing badly on the one thing he thinks hes good at.  

When you got him at a calm moment, try to show him that he can be good at other things, he just needs to take time to try.  All skills are learned, he's probably good at games because he's played a ton.

He might have a few underlying mental health issues as well, anxiety disposition, depression are the 2 most common.  It's not uncommon for compulsive gamers to have ADHD or some degree of autism as well.

I have to rush off now so I can't finish this post at the moment, I can only say best of luck to you both."
"I don't know. I have very little experience with narcolepsy but it's worth a try going down that path even if it's just to rule it out. It might give you peace of mind and ease your anxiety to get a definitive yes/no about it. 

I think the ashwagandha is helping! I still experience depression and anxiety occasionally but now I have coping skills and things to do to try it ride it out. I don't think it's would have been strong enough to get rid of my constant anxiety all by itself but, then again, I don't know, I didn't try it then so it might've! People on the internet seem to really like it. Also, when I feel anxious, I feel like my heart doesn't beat as hard and as fast as it used to so maybe that's a sign that my body is dealing with the extra cortisol better? "
"I’m not sure what is going through her mind, but sometimes joking about suicide is a way to get peoples attention. Whether or not she’s serious, I don’t know. Either way, it’s something to be taken seriously and not dismiss. I think you should reach out and say something along the lines of:

“I noticed you were talking a lot about suicide and wanted to make sure you were okay. Is something going on that I can help support you with?” 

Of course, add your touch to it.

I had an ex that told me that if I didn’t get back with him, he would kill himself. I was 16 at the time and was scared, so I had my mom call his mom. He was with a friend at the time doing just fine. 

Bottom line, don’t take suicide remarks lightly even if you think they’re joking."
"Your mother should get her own counselor or attend a group like AL ANON that is for the family members of addicts. Your mother needs to stop enabling your brother and allow him to hit rock bottom. Until then, there will be very little motivation for him to stop using and actually get better. She is making it too easy for him to keep doing what he is. Hopefully by seeing a counselor or talking to other people in her situation your mom can come to the realization that by helping him she is actually killing and prolonging his addiction. It is no one’s fault but your brother’s if something bad happens to him because you guys stop enabling him. He is an adult and making his own choices. I’m so sorry you guys are going through this and I wish you the best of luck. "
"they're really strict about overtime, and my coworker who does full time at the school can't go over 40 hours and we only have one other staff member beside me and her who is in college so she can't work the opening hours, so I have to open, so my full time coworker can close, the school is open 12 hours. It's technically not over time since it's not the same business it's just owned by the same woman. and if you're trained as an Aveda Advisor at one place it's the same protocols as the other. I put off my esthetician's license. and going to school for six months because they needed me to work but have really treated me poorly. But because of my age, and location I don't think i could find anything better. I live in a college town and it's really hard to find jobs."
"You're cycling. Life is energy, serotonin, balance.

Your priority here should be weaning off the drugs. You have absolutely no idea who the real you is when you are going up and down like this, and your chemical influences are causing a lot of it. You're probably even overly sensitive to these drugs as you feel so attached to them. I even had to stop drinking in order to find middle ground. 

When this happens, you are going to notice a lot less of the extreme highs and lows. I am SHOCKED how something like even a good or bad nights sleep can take me to a 2/10 or a 9/10 day. Treat this all with the utmost respect. 

Perhaps after that, you can focus on the issues of how your personality #1 is talking to #2, which is another very common thing. You are doing just fine, and those filled with the most personal power and potential to change usually struggle with this stuff the most, you're just directing all of that energy inward instead of finding a path and then helping the world. 

Good luck my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;"
You’re using this subreddit exactly how it’s suppose to be used! It’s suppose to be like a diary but with people there to respond and support you! So no worries there. Sometimes I find it helpful to just get out all the bad stuff out it’s kinda like the stomach bug you feel a bit better when you get it out (sorry for the gross analogy :)) I think posting was a good idea and I really think you shouldn’t delete this because when you’re in one of those “ups” you can look back and read your post and maybe it will help remind you how much you really truly are struggling. Sometimes I would write letters to myself when I was really low so that when my mood elevated I could remind myself that if I didn’t want to go back there I needed to take action. Also I completely get wanting to be less raw when you talk to your parents. Your friends definitely sound like shitty friends (but I’m sure you know this already). Life really does suck ass sometimes and mental illness is a bitch and it’s even worse when you don’t have a great support system. I’d imagine it’s pretty emotionally draining to need to comfort your girlfriend and act like everything is ok when it’s not. I don’t know where I was going with this comment either and now I’ve word vomited
"YES! I am on SSDI right now, and going through it was hell on wheels, but worth it. I have been on it for years and years now (Geez...almost 15 years?) so I don't remember my own experience, but I can tell you, I just went through the SSI process for our youngest child (he is 8) because he is Autistic. We got denied, we got a lawyer (I still owe them $200 d'oh), and we won. In fact, I am waiting for my last lump sum from his back pay, which will be coming my way on Feb. 17th, 2019. I can't wait because it is quite large.   


I can tell you from experience, be honest. They are used to people talking to them about all sorts of disabling conditions, both mental and physical, so take your time and try to think of what you are going to say beforehand. I don't know what your unique problems are but I also have a very unique problem that not many people outside of the internet know about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I DO remember feeling awfully awkward when talking about how my mental problems are affecting my life because I, also, minimize and hide a lot of my pain. It felt like ""bragging"" and I do remember feeling SO relieved when it was over. As I said, let it ALL out, don't minimize your issues but try not to exaggerate either, if possible. I exaggerated just a TEEENY bit because it is hella hard to get SSDI and I knew it. I didn't lie though. The problem (severe depression) is there. So is the anxiety and all the other stuff.   


I wish you good luck. You can also work while on SSDI, so if you want to you can check or ask someone about that. In our state (not sure if the same everywhere, but probably) you can make something like $800 a month or close to it at a job and still keep your SSDI benefits. :)  


Let me know how it turned out ok? I am in the same boat, so I understand! "

"&gt;I did have a negative experience with a psychologist though. I'm not saying this to discourage you, but to let you know that it can take more than one try to find the right therapist. If you have any specific questions, then don't hesitate to ask me.

Seconded"
Absolutely. Just because they’re more common it makes people think they need more attention. If anything it’s those with rare disorders that need the most help and support because it’s harder to find doctors that know about it or other people that understand
"Damn that's a lot for anyone to deal with, honestly don't know how people do it, depression was bad enough but add delusions, hallucinations and elements of depression and that sounds like a nightmare to me, really hope I don't have to deal with it later in life. "
"Got halfway through, tried to go back and re-read the vignette, and it nuked all of the responses. 

Gave up at that point. 

If it happened to me, you can be pretty sure it happened to others trying to help with your survey too.

I'm sorry to hear this. Maybe get her to take you to the noise source so she can see if it's real or not. It might make her feel silly but I don't know what else you could do to convince her. I know how hard dealing with schizophrenia is. I hope things get better.
"I'm sorry. :'( I know it's pretty heavy but I'd hate to think it was painful in any way. I'm a pretty big guy with facial scars that can be measured in inches with depth, and it makes me bawl like a little girl with a skinned knee and shit. So you're not alone. :)"
It'll force you to be around other people. That's the biggest thing right there. You might be able to make a connection with somebody else who's struggling with issues too. Everybody's going through something. And sometimes it's nice to know that you're not alone.
"My landlords own the condo that I’m renting from them. So they have a few rules that they put in the lease that aren’t part of the condo association rules, specifically the “no pets” rule. It’s apparently because one of my landlords is allergic to pets. "

"Very little. Parents, we haven't really talked to much about it since the diagnosis, as we didn't really buy it. I don't know how to tell anyone of my friends or people I know. I don't know what this'll mean for me. It's hard for me to gauge how severe it is. Fuck"
"Yes, I had a Genesight Lab done. I’ve had many trial and errors with different combinations of medication for several years, the results made sense and my doctor stayed in the scope of what worked best with my body. I’ve had little to no side effects as well. "
"And ""facing it"" doesn't mean simply going on with life in the way that you were used to. It means encountering what is there, what thoughts, feelings and sensations are there, without resisting it, without identifying with it, without taking them seriously.

I recommend you to absorb material from mystics and teachers such as osho, ozen rajneesh, Eckhart Tolle and adyashanti, amongst others. If you are truly open to them, they can be a great relief to your system and can inspire you with hope, courage and clarity. "
"And I think we’re both smart enough to know that no single human is exactly alike that being experience or appearance, so what you went through vs what she is going through aren’t gonna have the same solution, if it were that way there would be no need for this sub, correct? It’s this closed minded thinking that causes such a wave of hate and problems, if everybody could just learn to be patient and realize that the world doesn’t revolve around you, we might actually be able to make some god damn progress. "
"From a student's standpoint, there's this feeling that mental health especially isn't valued by most teachers. It's viewed as an excuse rather than a legitimate issue that inhibits learning. 


I just finished up accommodations meetings with professors at my universities, and there was a group that was like ""yeah sure whatever,"" but there was a couple that took the time to see how I'm doing, how we can work together, and to feel like a teacher understands you and is willing to work with you is just so important.

"He sounds like a dick, you can’t control me my ass. In that case control yourself and when he wants to have sex tell him to fuck whoever it was he wanted to fuck and if he wants to have sex again the only “I’d fuck her” you ever want to hear is him referring to you. And then brace for nasty tantrum that will surely follow. Don’t give in, he’s already not taking you seriously. 

Yeah immature and childish, thing is he is not being reasonable about it and the high road hasn’t gotten you anywhere so far."
"I Hear you. I got diagnosed 2 years ago, ever since then I'm starting to notice all of these things. However, I'm of the strong opinion that we can get beyond managing, and really thrive.

I'll be making lots if videos about different methods, on how to use adhd to your advantage in the future. If celebrities like will Smith, Adam Levine and Richard Branson can do it, so can you. ;)"
"I had a bad experience as well, and I’m still working through it. I’ve been talking about it with my therapist and that’s helped. I’ve also read the book “How can I forgive you?” by Janis Spring and I thought that was really good.

I think I’ll have to read it again though, because I’m still not there yet. She also talks about the difference between forgiveness and acceptance, and I’m glad that acceptance is an option because it seems like that’s where I’m likely to end up with my experience. "
"I went to a psychiatrist today and after an hour of me discussing all of my symptoms (not just the ones listed here) he said he'd like to try putting me on a low dose of antidepressants and see how it goes for 1 month.

He also told me restlessness even without getting enough sleep, and some paranoia is rare but not completely indicative of schizophrenia since it's only very recent. However, he said should I hallucinate again I should let him know. 

Also the paranoia subsided a lot and I actually slept well today!"
"In the United States you can't force any adult to see a psychiatrist against their will unless that person is actively suicidal/homicidal.

There are really very few benefits or downsides to having a diagnosis as nobody ever has to know your diagnosis but you.  In fact, you don't even have to know your diagnosis if you don't want to.  Most people never ask and are never told who receive therapy but anyone who's ever been to a therapist and used some type of health insurance has received a mental health diagnosis.  "
"Man, my heart breaks hearing that. I'm so sorry that was his end. It certainly doesn't seem stupid. It's no trivial thing, a life.
I lost a pet some time ago, he died of natural causes, in peace. Even that still hurts.
I don't know how you get the images out of your mind, things will fade in time I suppose. Maybe talk with someone close to you about the friend you lost, remember his life. He sounds happy, you made the world a little better with your love for him.
I don't know, this shit is hard whatever you do.



"
"Please don’t. My sister committed suicide when I was 16. My family has never been the same. If you can hold out for anything, hold out a little longer for your loved ones. You have no idea how much you matter to people. There are people you don’t realize who will literally break if they lose you. Please reconsider. 

**Also**, i get it. I’m in a similar boat with those feelings of boredom and not wanting to be here anymore. I’m just taking it a day at a time because I can’t put my family through any more."
"The cognitive decline, I think, certainly could be a symptom of depression. Another possibility, however, is that the cognitive decline *as well as* the depression are *both* symptom of some *other* underlying physiological disorder (hormonal, inflammatory, nutritional deficiency, etc). Also, if you are using psychiatric medications to treat your depression, there is the third possibility that you are experiencing side effects from that.

(Disclaimer: I have no formal qualifications related to any of these topics.)"
"Try working out or getting a dog, you know something to give you some feeling of purpose. Working out and keeping busy has kept me from my addictions and I was able to better myself and I am happier than I have ever been just by changing some things. I lived with depression my whole life and anxiety for years. It’s an uphill battle and exhausting, but I can honestly say that actively changing things to better myself and avoiding people that kept my life toxic was the best thing I’ve ever done for my happiness. "
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization

No reason to panic, but you should see a doc to make sure it's not caused by a serious disease. 

Most of the time it's due to stress. I get it during presentations sometimes. I call it my ""auto-pilot mode"". 

Sensory overload caused by noises, blinking lights and stuff can get better with the years as your senses blunt a little bit. You will have to learn how you react to certain situations and how to deal with them. "
"I have a friend who’s going through something similar and in terms of just general ‘bleah’-ness I gotchu. One of the worst parts of depression for me was how it would wreck all hope that you have. And yet somehow, STILL, one of the things that I believe unconditionally is that the world has a way of working itself out in time. Even though I consciously know that life isn’t like a story, the thought won’t leave my head. Anyway, my point is that things WILL change. If you haven’t met someone you’ve clicked with, you will in time. My friend had to frantically look for housing for university this summer and he thought he wouldn’t find anything, but one day he did. It’s all just a matter of time until things work out for you  :)  Hope this helped a bit!"
"I really do hope so, and that you are aware of the danger of overdosing. Don't worry about me, you did not cause a problem here, I just wish I had someone to tell me the same thing about my own past behaviour back then. 
I am happy if it helps a little bit, but do know that there are a lot of other option that are so much safer and that I can't recommend them enough.
Also, please be careful by dosing, and if you have the option where you are, to make sure to test it. If it's impossible, please at least get yourself a nalaxone kit, it's free and you don't have to give any of your infos, and it's given in many drugstores (pharmacies) and by some doctors and nurses, and of course in some injection safe sites if they exist where you live.
If anything you can contact me."
"Thanks for sharing the sub. I didn't know it exists either. I have two step parents, one of whom is a bit narcissistic, but mostly just has deep seated control issues, and the other who fits the definition of NPD to tee. Of course any person with NPD will never get the diagnosis because how dare you tell them they're the problem!

My way of dealing with them was to cut them out of my life. My father became my NPD step-mother's puppet after she drained him financially (e.g. went to signapore despite being behind on mortgage payments, without buying food for the 3 kids left at home; or claiming to not have money for a real Christmas, but somehow can afford a new fucking fur coat), so once he passed, I severed all ties. However, it's a lot easier when they aren't your real parents.

I think the healthiest way to deal with this is to be aware of what your mother is doing. Narcissistic people tend to be fairly predictable, always putting their interests ahead of everyone else, never willing to compromise, never accepting blame, and deflecting said blame back at the person claiming it in an attempt to basically gas-light them. This is why I recommend throwing thr guilt back at her in a far more mature manner.

She might be making you experience guilt for wanting a life but she chose to have you and raise you. If she wants to draw the line in the sand, then draw it for her. Say this is the line before she says ""here's the line but it should've been back there."" One important thing I've learned from years of therapy is that you can't change people, so you need to change your expectations of them. It's possible she has some resentment towards you and is acting out of that v resentment without even knowing it's there. If she's narcissistic, the idea of getting more admiration will (in my experience) outweigh the want to guilt others. It might not be an immediate return, but saying ""I'm not going to do what you want, I'll do what I want, but you don't need to support me if you don't want to"" doesn't give them the satisfaction of controlling you, but makes them feel like they got what they wanted anyways.

Something that has helped me reconcile with my parents and family, as well as my upbringing, has been the phrase ""people make bad parents."" People have this delusion that they will be a great parent because they want to be, and since kids lack the knowledge and authority to point out ways the parents could better help them, most parents end up living in a self-affirming cycle of thinking they're good, seeing something good that confirms their thinking while ignoring all the things that disprove it, and then continuing to think they're good parents. It's not really their fault. After all, parenting is not easy, but few parents, if any, can face their faults in the role without getting defensive, frustrated or even angry - after all, it's a very emotionally charged subject. Which is the very same reason that makes people bad parents. It's not their fault, but it is their responsibility, which makes it very personal. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's not your fault, it's theirs and they just don't know any better. You can try to change them, but that's pretty unlikely to happen. So it's better to take control of your life, and to find a way to forge your own path without them."
"The article has nothing to do with mental health. You are correct. Whether or not the article had anything to do with mental health was never the point though. The article is just evidence of the retouching.

I never claimed that there *was* evidence of psychological study in that article. Regardless, body image and the effects of social perception *are* something studied at such a level and that's what this is about.

I am informing others because we already have issues nationally and globally with self image. I even mention that it could be a good thing. The cause for immediate concern stems from the iPhone being the most popular phone in the US -- 80% of teenagers (a demographic where socially related mental issues commonly begin) prefer iPhones, while its still very popular among adults resulting in about 43% of everyone in the US.

This means that the vast majority of teenagers in the United States as well as a significant chunk of the rest of the population may quite suddenly be using this without being informed. That *is* cause for rather large concern. And that is largely where the call for even those who don't normally think about mental health on this level to tell others comes from - this genuinely does affect a lot of people on a national scale whether they know about it or not. 80% of people being inconspicuously shown a fake version of themselves is cause for alarm.

And also just...yeah the one time. Its exaggeration aimed at the people who usually will make fun of others for caring about mental health. This is about a sudden onset of a massive issue. That is meant for folks who will only care about that. This isn't a pissing contest between whether or not homelessness etc. are bigger issues. The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of people who *do not* take mental health and the general well being of others seriously, and the only way they will actually pay attention is if there is an actual event they can pay attention to. The other issues you mention are things that have been known for a very long time, and are often ignored as a result of their constancy; that phrase is about leveraging people who I wouldn't be able to get to care about those other topics anyway. For the demographic that targets, those *are* people for whom this will be one of the very few times if not the only time they actually speak up. This isn't a contest of whether it is the most important issue. It is a drive to get those who wouldn't care otherwise to pay attention. If along the way they care about homelessness etc. too....well awesome. The more the merrier. But if this is the only issue I can get them to care about, its still a win.

And in regard to hysteria...I even acknowledge that this could end up being a good thing. I quite intentionally included that because it really could. But we don't actually know and its about being aware based on what we already know about body image problems, and until we actually know either way to make sure people don't get negatively affected. You'll note that none of my statements in regard to the retouching are actual claims: I repeatedly highlight them as *concerns*. Erring on the side of caution and informing others in situations where more information needs to come to light is more or less always a good way to go.

I'm not calling for people to demonize Apple, or even for the destruction of such technology. I'm calling on people to be informed, and inform others. I'm calling for it to get enough attention to *be studied at a Ph.D level.* But more importantly, **body image issues are already studied at such a level and we know they are a problem.** Body-image related self esteem issues especially among teens are so prevalent that they're often covered in the students' health education right about when it becomes a realistic problem. Is there specific data on this in *particular*? No. So lets make it recognized well enough ahead of time. 

As far as our personal spats go... *you shot first dude.* You could just as easily have cited your concerns with my argument like you did now but without the personal angle; instead you were unnecessarily harsh. Note that the many others who have brought up issues in this thread has done it without bringing in a personal angle, and I have responded to them with simple debate. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, but you made a personal attack first. Its not fair to get mat at someone for being rude when you're the one that personally belittled them in the first place.

Edit: also just in the name of disarming the situation I misread your username as butttransmission and I thought that was hilarious.

Edit 2: As the whistleblower, I have taken responsibility to treat your concerns as legitimate, and make sure people across all channels that I've shared my concerns with (even outside of reddit) are informed as well, and making sure to remove my own pride from the situation. I have added this address to the main post, as I felt it was important. What I want you to know is I in no way intend to degrade you by using some of your arguments: you followed a public responsibility to contradict me just as much as I followed a public responsibility to inform others, and that is valuable and I think needs to be shared. I hope you do not take offense to this, as it was never supposed to be a matter of taking sides.

Also I just wanted mention that the personal pride and stuff was is in reference to taking a stand. That doesn't mean I suddenly stop feeling: it means I'm willing to get hurt if I need to to say what I think needs to be said. That doesn't mean that hurtful words just suddenly stop hurting when someone is putting themselves in the spotlight for the good of others; it just means they know they may encounter negativity. It still hurt. What you needed to say was your actual concerns with my position, not an attack on my sanity; that has nothing to do with pride in my *argument*, its just reductive and belittling. Its the mental health equivalent of ""well he's just a Dumbocrat/Republicrap."" It had nothing of value in response to the discussion and just targeted the speaker."

I obviously couldn't hold back my rant. I swear if I hear one more person say that they had no clue/can't understand/it's so selfish/try harder/victim shaming I am gonna PREACH right to them. Ignorance is only bliss for the ignorant. Ignorance is killing the rest.
I see you're in BC. As an I. Want someone to talk to? PM me and I'll give you my number. You can talk. Yell. Cry. I dont mind. Just do yourself a favor and work through this long enough to see another day. Perhaps together I can help you see another day after that.
"I see, but what you feel is different (even though I also feel like that quite a lot too), the thing with me is that I don't feel like /I/ love them... Or just anybody else. It's like I can't feel love for people even when they're supposed to be important to me... "
"I think the best thing you can do is not try to mush your friend into a category of mental illness, but rather recognize that he needs help (which you have!) and try to get that help.
Do you know his parents, siblings, etc who you could contact about your worries? "
I would post this to r/raisedbynarcissists. You would probably get more useful advice there regarding your specific situation. That community is honestly so supportive of each other. I’m sure someone else there has been in a similar situation as you and can help.
"If you see pillar23o7 you know what to do

He always deletes his post after being proven wrong and always changes what mental illness on some post he has bipolar others schizophrenia, autism, etc. Ive seen like 7 different ""diagnosis"" that dont relate to each other"
"It really does sound like a symptom of anxiety so, while it may well be something else entirely, I would encourage you to be open minded about that idea. Sorry I don't have anything more useful to say but, when you do figure out what it is, please share it with us!"
"Same, it annoys me when I hear corporate executives telling everyone to be mindful of others, mindful in general, mindful this, mindful that. 
Whatever the actual meaning of the word is, for me nowadays it's more of a buzzword than an actual mental health practice."
Thank you so much! I will try and do some clubs and maybe go running and I will definitely try out meditating because I’ve heard it helps and I’ve tried it before but never really had the time to actually do it more often. Again thanks so much for the advice :)
"When I had this problem, my gallbladder was functioning at 13% and had to be removed a week later. The psychologist stated in my evaluation that I had “anorexic tendencies” and thought that my problem was due to anxiety. Turns out I had an actual health issue. "
"Yeah, I was reading about that last night, but you can’t get one for bipolar, MDD or anxiety, all of which are also considered disabilities under ADA. I’m just saying that along with so many other societal constructs this too needs to be examined more closely. "
"Yup. I'm either ""not a severe or crisis case"" so no bueno, or they say they're ""a service aimed at milder cases than [mine]"".

Apparently I am just the most special of fucking snowflakes and am both too severe and not severe enough for *anyone* to actually help me."
"i tried to talk to a therapist through better help. i had such bad anxiety i was afraid to leave my house, so i figured, hey i can just text with someone. they declined my application saying i should see a face-to-face therapist. i tried to kill myself after that. "
"Agree fully with your analysis though I might add that this definitely isn't a gender thing. My ex used to do this all the time - checking out guys in restaurants and talking about them to me (lol). When I hung out with her friend(s), it was even worse. 

I didn't do the same as I didn't want to hurt her, but I tried it a couple of times  and got a lot of shit from her about _me_ being disrespectful (!). She didnt respect me that much anyway, and this was just one of many signs. I'm so glad I ended things with her. "
Alright I don't know much about the help you can get being from somewhere other than the UK but look for charities like the Lucy faithfully trust (it's an anonymous UK charity to help pedophiles and hebephiles) it's important you do this and talk to someone they're the people that can really help you and give you the best support. If you have something like the Samaritans over there they may also be able to direct you in the right direction. What ever you do don't act on your urges it's not worth the life in prison.
"Hey there! I can’t even imagine the pain you’re going through right now. But look, you don’t wanna do it! You’re saying it. You don’t want to. Please acknowledge that. It’s also very important to talk things out with the people around you. Share with the ones you trust and with the ones you know will always be there for you! It’s not easy, but it does change. You’ve made it to this moment so you can make it anywhere. PM me if you wanna talk about anything anytime! Let those thoughts go away from you."
"I tend to avoid reading things in this subreddit Becuase it brings me down but I clicked on this one becuase I empathized with it from the title. I was correct in thinking it was a similar situation being shared between us. 
I'm sorry to say that I've yet to find any sort of solution to this and I've tried and tried but I'm here to say that I understand (albeit you never said your problem was that no one understood) and that Im sure we can work past this eventually!
Also, I'm here for you if you ever need to talk :)"

"Okay, then maybe I misinterpreted your mindset from the get go. Maybe, and since I was already wrong I stress maybe, you actually need to do the opposite and not view people with different mentalities as unworthy of your time or impossible candidates for a connection.

But I may be in over my head with suggestions for you. I feel I have similar issues, and am trying to incrementally be open minded and use tricks to stop my mind from resisting other types of energy so much, whilst maintaining my core truth and logic."
"Sertraline (Zoloft) made me more suicidal.

I took citalopram (Celexa) for a while and found that it didn't do much of anything for me. My mood was unchanged.

Now I take bupropion (Wellbutrin). I've been on and off of it a couple of times because my psychiatrist thought it might be interfering with my antipsychotic medication, but I find it really helpful. I'm not walking around euphoric all the time by any means, but I'm no longer suicidal and don't get those really awful days of despair and misery like I used to."
"Write it down or put it in your phone verbally, whichever works best, if it's important. You might put the steps down while the person telling you what to do gives you the steps. That looks a little anal but better than messing up and seeming confused. I'd say it's a learning disability. Don't let it get you down. I'd work on managing the problem but I'd also say accept yourself. ADHD, learning disability, whatever -- there's no need to step up to crazy. As you can tell, lots of people struggle with the same issue. "
"You're right, I love my mother to death and she tries to see the good in everyone, but I can't stand to be around my father another minute.
All my mother ever does is enable him, make excuses for his actions, making it seem like as if it's my fault for him being this way even though he was always emotionally and mentally abusive towards us.
It's my last year of high school, so I'm very eager to move out, but I know for a fact that she'll pester me by saying that I'll ""miss"" him. I'm sorry but that will never happen."
"Your diagnosis is not...who YOU are as a person. It's just a tiny aspect of you. It's also just a label that helps you gain more awareness of your thoughts/actions, but don't take it too seriously as if its your entire identity. People are much more than their labels. It's natural that it hurts, it may take some time to come to terms with, but don't stop reminding yourself that you are much more than what you've been diagnosed with. Hope you have a good support system to be there for you during this shocking time ! "
"I could definitely be wrong, but I'll take a shot at explaining what I think OP meant:

Who the person acting as your therapist is can effect how you subconsciously interact with them and what you talk about. Which can potentially can effect your overall quality of therapy on both sides of the room.  Again, I could be wrong!

---------------------------------------------

A personal anecdote: The female therapist that I (a straight guy) saw for a year helped me in many ways. But because I have some specific baggage with women, it ultimately made me uncomfortable talking about any topics that were particularly intimate. 

IMO, definitely give her a chance, but don't be afraid to try someone else after a session or 2 if you're not feeling it! Congrats on seeking help! "
"I’m trying to find out-of-the-house things to do, so far I’ve started gardening and I’m considering volunteering once a week at the local animal shelter once I’m well enough to go back to work. It’s hard at the moment as I’m suffering quite badly from agoraphobia so I’m having to work towards leaving the house slowly. 

With regards to the therapy suggstion, I’m looking at a 6-month waiting list for a counsellor but my doctor referred me to a mental health assessment thing to see if there’s anything my doctor is missing.

I’ve found someone I can see regularly who is supportive, only problem is she is in 2 days flying out to the other side of the world for a month for a holiday so im not going to be able to speak to her regularly until next month."
" I guess I don’t really think of it that way. I didn’t develop mental health issues until my early 20s, I hit an all time low and nearly dropped out of school. I didn’t quite understand that the way I was thinking could be corrected by medication so it took my therapist a long time to get me on that train. 

Once I had been on medication I felt back to myself more or less. So for me I know it is just a crutch that is helping me continue to move forward.

I was in a good place mentally and went off it about a year ago. I found myself in a mental breakdown and I was crying 3 times a day for nearly a month. Being back on medication has really solidified in my mind that this is something I need and I’m just grateful we live in a world that has access to treatment. 

I’m not sure if you’ve had mental illness/have been on medication your entire life but since I have seen the juxtaposition of my life before I got mental illness, during, and in recovery I see it as something that brings me closer to my true self. "
"Hey. Your post hit home with me a lot and I've googled the hell out of this in the past with no luck! When I get low/anxious I retreat into a childlike state. This is sometimes really extreme, it can include going into a toy shop and buying things to take home to recreate that blissful feeling of creativity and imagination. Years ago I also made a list in my diary when I was upset about how to live like a child and it had things on it such as not having sex and spending more time with parents etc. Similar to you id also watch old shows and play old games. Unlike you I am close with my parents but I didn't like a good childhood so there is extreme rose coloured glasses. 

I have BPD but it's not a known trait of this. I've mentioned it to several therapists and no one seems fussed even though it really does bother me and can affect my functioning on a day to day level when it's bad (it comes in episodes for me so sometimes I'll go six months without it)

Drives me mad but I have no fix sorry. It's not just you though!

"Well, it could be several different things. Depending on what her life was like after losing her mom it could be an attachment disorder. If attachment disorders go untreated it’s extremely difficult for kids to go on to be happy, healthy adults. Or it could be Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD). ODD is very common in kids who have lost a parent or have had a big family change. It’s also especially common if the primary caregiver doesn’t foster emotional expression when the child is young. 

If you are in the US, most schools will provide or help facilitate diagnosis and treatment. This process can be started by either a teacher asking for testing, or a parent/guardian. If your sister’s behavior is disruptive to her school performance than this process goes much faster. It might even be a segue to talk to your dad about intervention. If that’s a no go then maybe your stepmom might be able to. 

  Obviously I don’t know the whole situation, but it definitely sounds like you care about your family and want your sister to live her best life.
Worst case scenario (very very rare, especially in females) is a personality disorder, and that will only really show itself in time. Also that age is difficult for most girls, even without the trauma of losing a parent. "
"There is a lot of societal pressure to ""love your parents, take care of them, respect them, they raised you etc"" but in extreme cases where someone has hurt you SO much, it's okay to accept that the relationship is entirely toxic and theres no love in it, even if they are blood related to you. You only have one biological father in your life, but if he's a shitty horrible person (I'm going off what you're saying- i obviously don't know how he is)- it doesn't mean you must suffer the rest of your life simply because you were born his child. I know that sounds harsh, but family isn't ""everything"" , its the genuine bonds and love within relationships that are so valuable and important..   
You may have a change of heart later, or he may even change with age. I used to have a very toxic unhealthy relationship with my father, and I even refused to acknowledge he was my dad. But after 5-8 years, he must have done some growing and went through drastic changes, spent a lot of time on his own and reflected on his life, and he's become so mellow and amazing. It's like he shedded his ego, aggression, and his need for control, and whats left underneath all that is who he really is. So anyway, for now, if you think the relationship is very negative, hurtful and downright toxic- you aren't obligated to endure abuse from him just because hes your dad. It's you right to protect yourself and stand up for yourself. Who know's, maybe one day he will experience something that changes him and you guys can build a relationship from then on. "

Theres a whole debate about the usefulness of diagnostic labels. At the end of the day they are purely and entirely what you decide to make of them.  Part of the deabte is that we can feel like we have been 'slugged' with each one thats applied, and whether thats doing harm or helping us. Remember that even if proper diagnostic protocols are applied - which they rarely are - the diagnoses are often incorrect, either in terms of category, or in terms of what they mean for us growing and moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying they are crap. Diagnostics can be really, incredibly useful 'signposts' of where we are at, and, more importantly, of where we need to go from where we are. They can help us to see what patterns exist for people who have had similar experiences, and, if we adopt them, they offer us community and an informal family of people who share part of our story, and our experience - and that can be a rare and valuable thing, for personal growth, to be a member of.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am saying is, ""its a label someone has stuck to you"". Do what you need to with it. You can look at it, you can research it, you can talk to others with it and see how their stories relate to yours, you can consult knowledgeable or experienced people about it, you can read about it, you can pick it up, screw it in a ball and put it in the bin if you want. You can adopt it like a kitten, cling to it, find solace in it. You can keep it permanently or temporarily, - picking it up when its useful to you and putting it down when its not -  or opt to reject it outright at face value with no further consideration. All of these are real choices available to you from the moment its applied. Its just a label. It is what you make of it."
"I think one important thing to learn when working is how to take care of yourself. I think when I started working I was much like you, I would take whatever I was given and treat it as a challenge to complete, no matter how damaging it might be to my mental health or ability to do my job well in the long run. I see it in younger workers around me now too, and I'm not entirely sure how to approach it. 

On the one hand, I think the can-do mindset is just the best thing in the entire world. I will take an enthusiastic employee over a qualified drongo every day of the week and twice on Sundays. But at the same time, people need to look after themselves, and I think particularly in modern times it can be dangerous to develop working habits that are easy for unscrupulous managers to take advantage of. It's easy to feel guilty about needing to take a break or say no to overtime until it's too late. Burn out is a real thing, and it can be pretty bad. 

I think do what you can to keep your great attitude towards work, because that really is an asset that any employer will be glad to have. But try not to get too emotionally invested with these people who sound like they're screwing you around, and don't be afraid to say no to their long hours and associated BS if you have to. It's not your fault that they're understaffed, poorly managed or whatever reason they need you to work long hours. If need be, just lie and say you have family in town, or appointments, or whatever. 

Looking after you is the most important, because if you can't stay healthy and happy then you won't be doing any work at all. At least that's the way I look at it. A working career is a marathon, not a sprint, and establishing boundaries and limits on what you will do for a paycheck is worthwhile.

"I am diagnosed with schizophrenia, and I experience what you do as well. I'm definitely by no stretch saying you have schizophrenia, but schizophrenia is a collection of psychotic symptoms – it's possible you may be experience some kind of mild psychosis.

&amp;#x200B;

Agreed, a professional may know better.  


Generally, I've found I smile when something is ""funny"" indeed because that's the ""normal"" reaction, but I think I do it because normally I would genuinely smile, but because my mind is somewhere else the only thing that my body can do is react in what it thinks is the expected way.  


I think you should really pay attention to your thoughts when you are giving these contrived reactions. Were you actually present in the conversation? You seem to be a high achiever, and people like that are often bored with mundane conversation, so their thoughts drift to something that's more interesting to them. As a result, you are only partly there for the conversation being had. It's very well possible that your overall apathy is due to a disinterest – your thoughts are spending more energy on things that stimulate you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think I have any credibility in what I'm saying, and you want to be more present, try reacting/responding to people as if you're in your 50s and the people you're talking to are your adult children. What I mean by that is, they are people you love with all your heart and would do anything for, but with the recognition that they are autonomous adults (basically I'm saying, don't confuse the word ""children"" for a lack of maturity). The ""children"" perception isn't actually something I use for myself, but the idea I'm trying to get across is shifting your consciousness to the thoughts and feelings of the people around you, rather than the thoughts and feelings that are presumably more interesting to you.  


Like being an introvert. You recharge by living in your own thoughts and feelings, but it's important to give and share with others; spend some energy being present in those moments."

"I mean... You made sweeping generalizations about something using a couple of internet magazine articles to back it up. I'd say you were right to expect some people to ""come out of the woodwork"" to defend something that's brought them and others relief. So congrats?"
"It could be a combination of anxiety and depression. Maybe something more? I have the same problem when my anxiety is really high. Which has actually been everyday non-stop for about a week. Its hard, and i wish i had advice for you.. I'm struggling with it myself. "
"I’m sorry to hear that. I’m worried this will happen to me. I had to leave my second part-time job because I was having so many panic attacks that they told me I was too unreliable to have more than a couple hours a week, so I figured it was best to leave."
Thank you for sharing and opening yourself up. I hope you’ll inspire other men to do the same. It will be healthy both for you and the whole world. I love what you said about being in your body and feeling like you can face and accept reality from your embodiment
"What would you like to know about them? Besides that they SUCK sometimes, esp when there are other people are around and I can't give in. I shake and get irritable...I snap at the kids for no reason. It really sucks. I do see my Psych soon, so it will be brought up."
"Yeah I know what you mean, I'm just hoping to work a way out to fix this. I'm signed of work for a bit. Unfortunately I moved far from family and friends to be with my wife haha so. 

But if this doesn't get fixed I've got to agree it defiantly can't get any worse. "
"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. I can definitely relate to the distressing nature of impulsivity. Have you considered seeing a doctor for a diagnosis? I think it might help bring some clarity to your situation. I've also found therapy to be very useful in helping me manage my impulsive behaviors and distressing thoughts. May I ask, are you struggling with other symptoms in addition to the impulsivity and distressing thoughts? Bust of luck to you, let me know if you'd like to discuss further. "
"This might not be the original focus of the question, but I find that it’s really hard to be honest about what’s in my head just because others’ wouldn’t know how to react or they would misunderstand or react negatively. Part of me tends to think that if anyone were to dig deep enough and become truly familiar with the depths of their thoughts, they’d feel the same way. Maybe our social rules just don’t allow for the expression of the often weird and unpredictable nuances of our deepest mental processes. "
"This sounds like a warning sign of a mentally abusive relationship with a narcissist. I’m biased, having helped my mom escape a similar relationship, but I encourage you to consider your long term well being.

"I am also a teacher, as well as someone who has struggled with mental illness. I think regular mental health checks for everyone is a great idea - we get a physical every year even if our bodies feel fine, just to check, so why not do the same for our minds?

Having said that, I think it would be more plausible to have it be something covered by insurance and required before starting school, same as a school physical. Logistically, it would be hard to implement them during the school day - a psychological assessment takes a lot longer than a quick scoliosis or vision check. Also, having it outside of school would allow students and parents to choose a provider they are comfortable with. Teens especially are not going to open up to someone they don’t feel safe with. "
"I suppose technically they are predetermined as you were nurtured into be a kind person. I think you still have the option to say yes or no to helping me though. I think our lives are quite predetermined but not to too much of an extent. 

But yes, I’v often thought that the reason so many millennials are miserable is simply due to our access to information. Not only do we finally realize how insignificant we are (they knew way less about the universe when our grandparents were children). But we also get to see all the negative things about our world in super speed.

Turn on your phone in the morning. “Breaking news we have 2 years until climate change fucks us” “breaking news 20 raped and murdered in syria” “breaking news housing market too expensive”. "
Not consistently but there are certain situations that spike nightmares for me. When I get really stressed I get nightmares. If I’m thinking too much or worrying about something I can. Also certain medications I’ve experienced will give me crazy nightmares. I’ve even heard eating before bed and spicy food causes it too. Are you particularly stressed out? I know for sure once you start dreading the nightmares you kind of provoke them and then you’ll have them. If you think about having a nightmare before you fall asleep you likely will. It’s pretty psychological as well. Try to relax and convince yourself you’ll have a good dream before you fall asleep. Think as positive as possible. Also see if there are situations you can change to manage the nightmares!
"Do you have any other friends or peers? You might not realise it but that depressive feeling of isolation and lonliness may be in a lot of those around you, even those who seem completely fine around you and may have lots of friends may be going through a hard time. Do you have a peer in your class who is nice to you and whom you like you can text? They might be a bit taken aback at first but I can reassure you that no one who is even remotely able to understand your feeling of lonliness will be cruel enough to abandon or ignore you when you need them, even if you don't talk to them and so often, people are nicer on the inside than they show on the outside sometimes. If not, like others in this thread you should know that you can talk to me if you want to because I have also been feeling a bit lonely lately, as if no one wants to text me back, talk about my problems, I am getting separation anxiety because a friend of mine is going to uni and they don't have time for me anymore, so I guess I kind of know how you feel. "
"Hey, so this is how a friend of mine has explained their OCD a couple times. It sounds like you're struggling with compulsive behaviors, and the certainty that something terrible will happen if you don't do things a certain way, which lines up with what I know of OCD. It might be worth looking into to see if you see yourself in this or similar disorders.

https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml

As for therapy, it sucks that you've been having trouble getting treated. Having a regular therapist that you see once every week or couple of weeks can help a lot in working through things, is this an option available to you? Therapy will take more than one session to help you and address what you want to work on, so keep that in mind. If you're looking for a diagnosis or explanation, that will also take multiple sessions for the therapist to get to know you. 

I'd suggest finding a regular therapist, if possible, and in the mean time looking up tips on managing compulsive behavior."
"&gt; A therapist who shared your core values would lose their license. That's my point. 

i dont think u can definitively know there are no licensed therapist who share my EVIDENCE BASED views.

&gt; Unfortunately, conservatives these days often want to define special realities for themselves that match their preconceptions

i think thats definitely the case with some issues like climate change, which conservatives suddenly and inexplicably started denying part way through GWB's presidency, but that doesn't apply here- if anything it's liberal therapists who expect men and women to defy biology and create safe spaces for ""LGBT"" people who disobey biology

&gt; Maybe you should try the clergy at a very conservative church. In all honesty, you are much more likely to get what you seek there.

well as i wrote in my previous comment, i don't want a conservative christian therapist who tries to bring me back into the fold. and as i wrote in the op, i tried therapists who advertised themselves as conservative, but they were christian, and i found that unhelpful and pretty traumatic because the abuse that led to my first attempt happened in a christian church environments. and im an ex christian. so i definitely will **not** find what i seek at a conservative christian church."
"My PTSD was misdiagnosed as BPD. In my experience when I was an inpatient, lots of women with PTSD were fighting to get diagnosed correctly as having PTSD. I fought for a PTSD therapist who specialised in relationship trauma, and I managed to get her. 

She changed my life. She managed to get the psychiatrists to take me seriously about the PTSD symptoms I was having, saved my life at least twice, did EMDR to help me with some particularly nasty memories, and helped me realise that I also have DID. Without her, I'm fairly sure I'd be dead. 

Like you, I didn't fit many/if any of the symptoms of BPD, but the psychiatrist who tried to diagnose me with it was notorious at that hospital for prescribing overdoses of drugs to, and I quote, ""make life easier for the normal people out there"". I refuse to see psychiatrists now. I feel betrayed by the lot of them. My psychologist, however, was a freaking angel and I got so much out of therapy with her. 

I would advise trying psychology as a way to find out what's wrong. I used to spend over an hour a week with my psychologist, so she got to know me very quickly and pushed the time limit (she was only meant to spend 50 mins per person) so we could finish our conversations properly. She managed to help me when I was ""unhelpable"". "
"Thats a very hard situation you're finding yourself in. I'm sorry you feel this way.  


A lot of people (including myself) feel anxiety when talking about their own mental health. It always feels like adding to someone else's problems, showing weakness or admitting that you're a bad person. The worst thing you can do, however, is not tell her at all.

See, you might feel like you're annoying her, or giving her more to worry about, but if you don't get help and/or deal with the issues you're making it harder for both yourself and her.  


Now for actually doing it, I recommend you pick out a day beforehand. Sure, it might build up anxiety towards said day, which can be really stressful, but it also mentally prepares your for what's going to happen. I wouldn't pick a day too far off though, because you don't want to overanalyze every possible scenario. I personally did it two days after I decided I was going to tell my close friends and family, but everyone is different so don't be afraid to take more or less time.

  
If, however, you still feel like you really can't talk to her, see if there is a professional you can ask for help either by talking to someone at school, seeking some kind of internet help (in my country we have government sites for that, though I'm not sure if that's the same everywhere) or going to your general practitioner and asking them for help. At least you won't need to worry about annoying them, it's their job. ;)  


I do hope you tell someone close to you, though. It makes recovery a lot easier."

"And now I'm just afraid it's too late to change. I can see my bleak future should I decide to keep living this way, but part of me sees life as already over because that which I used to attach to and chase after is either not the same, or no longer interesting to me."
Anger is a normal response. Try not to feel guilty for experiencing it... But you are right not to display it to your son. He sounds very vulnerable right now. The best thing you can do is to keep showing him that you are there for him and you're not going anywhere.
"Hey I care. There are counseling options for people on Medicaid (if you don't have that, get on that). Call a crisis center and they'll help you. I just called the suicide prevention hotline and they helped me out. I can link the website they gave me in a few minutes"
"I suffer from the same! However, my psychiatrist says it’s a symptom of severe anxiety. I totally understand your frustration! It’s really annoying and hurting my work life. I hope you get the treatment you need. Much love from another depression/anxiety sufferer"
"If you have no money, you should qualify for Medicaid, which is a type of health insurance for people under a certain income level. I would start by looking into that. If you are able to get that, you will be able to see doctors/therapists and get back on your meds. "
"Its kinda like sad how can my life be like this kind of negative.
Ah, I rarely cry though. I usually bottle it up because I cant really cry whenever I want.
But I feel like I want to cry quite often.

But I think if that's the case I should go see a good therapist. 
"
"Thank you so much. Sending love and hugs to you, too. Whilst I am *incredibly* grateful for the NHS over here in the U.K., I’m also quite bummed with the fact I’m having to wait so long especially as I seem to be getting much worse recently. ): 
Good luck to you "
"i always just tell myself that it’s not real and that it’s shadows or my mind playing tricks on me, but that always makes it worse. I’ll try embracing it and see what happens, and if it does get worse i’ll go for some professional help. thanks for your input!"
"well, I have pretty bad nightmares and I have a tendency for paranoia... I also scream in my sleep often, but don't remember the dreams. I guess that's it? It's also pretty much the reason I see random flashes of horrific images, like mini-hallucinations but shorter."
"I have said before 'I prefer not to say' - they can't force you - might put you far down the list though!!! 

Otherwise I just say 'mental health'. Also if you have a history where they were monitoring you previously for the same issue I very much doubt they will just fob you off. 

If you are really scared (and it's true) say 'with suicide ideation' - you will get a face to face I reckon. 

ETA: I hate the receptionists. They (or at least the main 2 at my surgery) are obstructive, unhelpful and on occasion spiteful. "
"Try brand.  Citalopram (I believe) is the generic of Lexapro, either that or it is very close to Lexapro.  You might have better luck with the brand name, because it has more of the medication in it.  I had this problem with my thyroid meds.  I was on generic Synthroid (levothyroxine), and I didn't feel like it was working mainly because my levels were still low and I was tired all the time.  When my doctor switched me to the brand name (Synthroid), it was like night and day.  So getting brand can make a difference.  "
"Whatever you do, do not contact her.  Again, do not contact her. Nothing, no texts, Facebook etc..
Ask yourself why are you so devastated by the loss of one girl out of 4 billion.  You have no one to blame but yourself. Women don't want needy men who think they are madly in love, that's non-sense. Now go grab your balls from the jar in the refrigerator and stick them back in and find an upgrade but stay out of bf/gf until you sort yourself.  

Edit: might seem harsh, yes.. but you dont ever want to feel broken again. "
"Your family needs a rude awakening. And please don't get offended by me saying that. You need help. You need to be firm and blunt with your family. They need to pay for therapy. And they need to pay for doctor visits. 

Ask them this. Ask them whether or not they would rather see you continue to struggle. And continue to suffer. Ask them if they would rather see you completely miserable. Instead of happy. They need to pay for doctor visits. And they need to pay for therapy. And it needs to be done as soon as possible."
"yknow, toxic or not, shes my legal guardian, or whatever the fuck you call it, im 17, ive lived with her as my only legal guardian since i was too little to remember, i dont love her, i understand where shes coming from, but i dont fucking love her, im closer to hating her than she realizes,, but she is still my legal guardian, i cant do much, not to mention the fact that im going to school now, a school which shes paying for, so the next four years are gonna be hell on fucking earth, unless i can get some juicy drugs"
"First off I might be reading it incorrect but you met your psychologist twice and he went for BPD? I'm not a psychologist but I would think something so difficult to diagnose isn't the first thing you go for. I mean if I'm correct especially after 2 meetings. 

However I do recommend you get help if you feel you need it. Admitting to yourself you need help ain't easy. Since you did I believe you know you need it. 

Therefore I highly recommend you do. It's terrible that your experiences with psychologist aren't that great. The worst I've heard was of not having a connection with their current psychologist an inconvenience at best. 

I'm not sure were you from but I hope every country has the same lean way to switch psychologist. I hope you get help and remember if you don't feel comfortable or no connection you can always request another one. By that I don't mean finding the one who tells you what you want to hear though. Find one that listens doesn't judge and in a professional manner tries to feel what you're feeling. It's really the best explanation I have you'll now what I meant when you find him/her. 

I really hope you get help! You're not alone and don't have to do it alone. I wish you all the best and strength you need to get through this! 

Kind regards,

Astyv "
"Hey there. I feel like the most important thing for you to know (and you probably already know this) is that your moral integrity is not in any way compromised by you having accidentally stumbled upon that thumbnail. It is, understandably, a traumatizing thing to have seen, but you weren't looking for it. You happened to stumble across that thumbnail randomly. You just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. The fact that you reported it indicates that you are a good person with a strong moral compass, and you should be proud of yourself for doing the right thing. Seeing something like that on a pornsite is understandably traumatizing, so it might help to seek out therapy just so you can talk it out with a mental health professional, especially if you're. experiencing suicidal thoughts. I'm not on reddit a whole lot, but if you need someone to talk to feel free to send me a message. Just keep in mind that none of what happened is your fault IN ANY WAY. Unfortunately that kind of fucked up stuff happens in the world and you caught a small glimpse of it firsthand. It might help to force yourself to go out and do some sort of volunteer work to help take your mind off of it, while also providing some good for your community. Hope I was able to help in some way. "
"You have to figure out what your boundaries are and make them explicit. Things like ""I cannot support you in this unless you're seeking care,"" or ""I need you to ask if I'm ok with an emotional conversation before you start one"" are ones I've used in the past. You've already set a boundary (talking less), but making a more concrete marker (talking no more than x times per week, say) will make it clearer when he crosses a boundary.

If he crosses them, say ""I am not comfortable with this, it's crossing a boundary"" and redirect. If he doesn't stop crossing boundaries, tell him you no longer wish to speak with him (through written message), then document further contact. The clear statement that you don't want contact anymore and collection of documentation will be necessary if he harasses you and you need to contact law enforcement/get a restraining order.

His showing up at your house uninvited is a huge red flag, and it might make me progress straight to the ""please don't contact me"" over the setting boundaries. I would also *seriously* recommend that you call 911 if something similar happens again; he should be at the hospital if he's as suicidal as he's saying. Your city/county might have special crisis officers (vs regular police), so it might be worth looking that up."

I’m sorry things aren’t going well for you at the moment. Just remember doing those things won’t help. It will only cause more problems. You can PM me if you’d like someone to talk your situation over with. I’ll always be here to try and help you talk it out

Pretty much.  Whatever laws and company policies that may exist on paper will only actually protect you if your employer is stupid enough to write down or film themselves saying they're firing you for having a mental illness as opposed to performance-related issues.
Same!! I used to work for a family counseling center and I know a couple of the counselors there who have relatively cheap self pay rates (~$50-70) for a 1 hour session. I already have medication in place so I’m not worried about that. Just need someone to talk to.
She’s not possessed by a demon she is mentally ill. No one is saying that you should cure her they are telling you not to abandon her and let her down. Your daughter is mentally ill and what she needs (even if she doesn’t appear as though she wants it) is support.

"""Get better"" is open ended and completely entitled to such different variations with mental health. Firstly, \*get better than this\* to which i believe yes, its absolutely possible.. after you find the right amount of motivation and drive for it. Which in itself is truly just a process. You seem to have just started now that you're openly admitting that you're not okay. Also, therapy is a massive step of recovery and you deserve lots of recognition from your own self that you're moving in the direction to get better. "
"100% spot on. First off medications advertised on tv are primarily for depression and are misleading (I think). People can easily understand “sad” and “butterflies in the stomach” so they are now accepted. They are wrong to think of it the way they do so I don’t think acceptance = understanding. 

You’re right about any other mental illness though. Partly because it’s very hard to explain and people just can’t deal with that reality that some of us suffer greatly every day. (I have bipolar ii and PTSD.)"
"Dont know if it's the same as yours. But I have times when I feel great about life and I feel motivated and good about myself. Then there's times  where I genuinely feel  horrible and legimately hate everyone. Like it surprises me what malicious, bitchy, angry and, frankly, evil thoughts go through my head. I just feel so mad that my life can be so crappy and the people around me life are better that I just hate everything. I have to stop myself from talking to people around these time before I  say something I regret."

"Just remember that the DSM is kinda bullshit sometimes and that your diagnosis doesn't define you. I had sort of the inverse experience where I thought I had something ""worse"" and when I was diagnosed with something more ""mild,"" it made me feel like I was being dramatic and that I wasn't as sick as I actually was.

That twisted bit of logic set back a lot of my treatment and actually made me worse for a while. Just keep the internal dialogue with yourself going and find a form of treatment that works for you.

Chin up."
"The relationship to my father was quite complicated do to him being a severe alcoholic. I wanted it to end. To go away. I hated that he was like that. But even though I hated him for being like that, the anger and grieve didnt go away when he died. It still lingered and after 3 years I'm not over it. How you feel about him wont go away. Even in dead it will haunt you. You must cope with it because with all that built up hurt and stress, it will eat at you and it wont bother him a bit. I send good vibes and best wishes."

Try an online counselling service like betterhelp or eheadspace.

Download the headspace app and try some mindfulness.
In your states of panic, don't try to fight it, to run away. Let it run its course,  all you need to remember is to breathe. Breathe in for a count of 4, out for 5.
Put your hands over your stomach to feel your breathing, and just focus on that for as long as you need.

I even told my new psychiatrist whom I only met twice about my issues and he discharged me back to my doctor after looking through my notes and acknowledging that I have a family history of manic depression and violence. 

They will never take you seriously unless you fit their definition of needing help. And it fucking sucks. Hope they eventually listen to you. "
"I have no TBI that I can recall. I recently had an event that I could say was the closest to death I had ever come. Almost TBoned by a car while on my bike. Shook me pretty good, and Ive been in vehicle fires, ocean mishaps, etc. 

Anger has been a defining feature most of my life, which has lead to minor self harm, fighting people, imploding. My rage usually starts boiling when I feel like I've been wronged by people who I help (ungratefulness, deceit). 

I blew up at my wife a couple of times recently, and it always came down to her adding more burden on me while not taking on any responsibility herself.

I can handle stress relatively well, but I do let negativity affect me deeply.

Childhood: foster care until 4yrs old, physically abused (remember a lot of it still)"
"I know your pain. I'm a girl who is just way too scared to dance at all, so I'm actually really impressed that you were able to do that. It honestly takes so much courage. I just think it's super awesome that you did that. Who the fuck cares what those girls thought?  And in general - if it helps you to know this - not being welcomed - it happens to everyone (usually guys because they're the ones who make the move generally). You can't win them all. I tend to avoid clubs like the plague though because the people in them can be total superficial assholes who I don't want to be around anyway. Another tactic you can try thinking of is to just dance ando your thing and if it looks like you are having fun and don't care how silly you look, you will naturally attract people. "
"That’s great you’re already engaged with professional support and that you’re eager to get better. The reality is that you haven’t been diagnosed with anything, yet there are some very concerning symptoms that appeared right after the mushroom trip. There are three things that can occur with your condition/symptoms: they eventually go away with or without intervention, they remain stable/exactly the same but you learn to live with them, or they get worse over time. You’re an individual and the professionals don’t sound like they have any idea what is the matter with you - there is no prognosis or real direction at this point. I hope professionals continue to take you seriously and that your mental health improves, even if your symptoms don’t. Best wishes x"
"it's kind of hard to follow, theres so many random things put together?

&amp;#x200B;

externally, you appear to have it all, but internally you still feel alone and empty?

do you think if X was interested in you, you would feel like life was better? If so, don't you think it's sad that your entire happiness would depend on a girl and a relationship?

you think a ""real"" man is one who doesn't care, doesn't have emotions? Everyone has emotions, unless you are a sociopath that renders you with no capacity to feel

Basically, you want to have zero feelings ? don't you think it's a bit contradictory, if you feel empty, having zero feelings won't make your life feel any fuller. Feelings and emotions are not negative, they are natural, can be very positive when managed well."
"Certain people can remind you of worse times. Whether you can cut them out of your life is of course sum of many things (whether they are family, friends, colleagues). Whether you should cut them out is also another thing. Depression can flatten your feelings and dissosiate all positive ones. Normally you could like being with aforementioned people, but now you'd just like to be alone and wallow in sadness (not judging though, I've been clinically depressed for a decade and sometimes you just wish to be left alone, to gaze the proverbial abyss that is depression)

As for the environment, it most certainly affects your mood and is a big factor in how you see yourself in the future.

Answer to your question would be, it depends on the severity of your depression and the significance of the people whom you mentioned. In other words, only you know whether it's the depression or if you should really remove those people from your life. Or you could talk to them and tell them how you're feeling (that'd be fucking scary though)."
"Diagnosis in mental health isn't as clear cut as say a broken arm. 
Think of it as differing opinions of why you are having difficulties rather than a stack of seperate difficulties. That will be less overwhelming to get your head around. 

If you make progress with one aspect of your life-say learning ways to reduce the severity of your distress, you are pretty much making progress with all of the diagnosis boxes at the same time.

It's not uncommon for doctors to change their mind about the cause of difficulties, if you try meds for depression for a year or so and it doesn't fix things then they start reconsidering diagnosis. 

Let the dust settle and then research and learn about BPD. Get to be informed and knowledgeable about it, don't be passively accepting - I don't mean you should be aggressive,but you should try and have a learning/growth mindset and have a plan to work to improve things. Nothing is unchangeable. 

There are subreddits for BPD, you might find useful to see if you identify with the people there.

"
"I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and insomnia. I recieved my first diagnosis when I was 16. I have struggled with cutting and other risky behaviors since I was 12. I OD'd on purpose 2 times trying to end the pain I felt. I'm almost 30 now. I have two kids. I have my associates and bachelors degree in psychology and a peer support certification. I am married to an amazing hard working man who usually handles my issues well. I have a wonderful support group and I went through a ton of doctors, therapists, and psychiatrists to find the right team for me. It has been almost 2 years since ive taken any medication for my behavioral health disorders. I have my mood swings and anxiety mostly under control and in have good coping skills that usually work and reddit and my support group when they don't. Almost every night I get to listen to my husband read to our son. 

Also, I have 3 idiot dogs. Life gets better. It doesnt always stay better but even when it goes to shot again it gets better again after that. Whatever you are going through now you will get through it because you ARE strong enough even if it doesnt feel like it. Whatever your goals in life are you will achieve them because you have the power to do so. It may take a long time but you will get there befoee you realize it. It took me a year to realize I had achieved my goal and it was because I had to redo my case plan. 

You got this. You are worth it. You are amazing. And I am so grateful that you are still here. "

"Also, if you do not give consent for contact, even if your parents called the provider they cannot confirm or deny that you are in services. However, you mentioned abuse. Therapists are mandated reporters so they would have to file a report on any abuse that you share."
Aw you're sweet. Yes I try to help everyone. I just wish there were someone here with the same issue as I have. Pyromania is relatively rare in adults my age (because it is not studied enough) but the psychologist told me it is very possible. I hope you feel better. :)
Concentrate on your counselling to get through your mental illness I understand it can be really difficult to hold down a job and friends but you can do it. Focus on your family members and friends that you are close with who you love as they will always be there you.
"For me, apathy is the worst symptom of depression. I can't cope with feeling nothing about everything. I hate it, it really does make me feel kind of suicidal. I'd rather be dead than be stuck feeling nothing forever. I know sounds extreme, but that's just how I feel. "
"I'm sorry things are tough for you, I hope you'll get the relief you're looking for. But I'm not sure how our situations match, other than being brothers in misery. Have you been diagnosed with something that you don't recognize? I wish you the best of luck regardless."
"I've been suggesting activities they can do that they enjoy, but it just seems like the depression keeps them in a vegetative state all day. Hopefully this cycle will break soon cause having one good day out of a month of bad days is still an accomplishment in my eyes."
"In the day I usually feel nothing but I laugh way too much to try and hide that, I've had problems with self harm in the past but i'm working past that. I'm trying.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I only feel things properly when i'm listening to music that gives me adrenaline."
"Seize the day. Leave your stuff behind. Take out a loan. Max out a credit card if you’re so inclined. Moving is easier than you’re making it sound. If the choice is between your overall well-being and a few hurdles, then that’s an easy choice to make. Just do it."
Sure thing. Sorry about the Squidward reference...I watch an AWFUL lot of Nickelodeon. I have 4 kids still at home (one in college too) and we watch that channel a whole lot. I am obsessed with I Am Frankie now. I absolutely LOVE that show. :D I am so glad to meet you.
Typing stuff out has calmed me down a little bit. Admittedly not much. I am diagnosed with schtizoaffective disorder depressive type. Also a fair amount of trauma to work through. It's a painfully slow process but I'll get there. Thank you for your concern and advice.
"Your behavior here is really concerning. It seems like you are fetishizing people with DID. It doesn't seem like you are concerned that you actually have DID, but that you *want* DID. 

Are you worried that you have DID?

Why do you want to talk to someone who has DID?"
"sad how relatable this is, the fact i’m so open about my mental health makes people and professionals believe im accepting of it and don’t need as much help. just because i don’t shut down and refuse to talk doesn’t mean i’m not struggling idk its hard right?"
"After struggling w depression and BPD, it’s very hard for me to keep a job. I’m in retail cosmetics and the places I’m employed do not play with a day off. I’ve had to search for somewhere I can truly feel comfortable.

After walking out of my last job sobbing, I looked into unemployment. I know that’s a route almost no one wants to take, I just want to remind y’all it’s an option.

I went back to work at a new company because I’d be ashamed, I appreciate a good work ethic. I’m tabling the idea though."
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

"My partner has anxiety/agrophobia especially with travelling/crowds his advice is to start small achievable goals and don’t try to rush it as you have the possibility of  overwhelming yourself, for example if you decide to try a new restaurant which is out your comfort zone you’d be best going at a less busy time, and sit where you can find an exit if you need to leave, having that option alone usually means that you won’t need to get up and go, even if you did it’s not a defeat just try a bit longer next time! "
"That’s really rough. I’m sorry your dad recently died. Like you said, you didn’t ask for mental health problems and it’s irrational for your mother to blame you for your father’s death. Not making excuses for your mother, because what she’s saying is hurtful, wrong and abusive, but she’s going through the stages of grief - bargaining and anger from the looks of things. Try to see her comments for what they are and not take them personally. You have more than enough to deal with already. Take care, friend x"
"I’m very sorry to hear that. Would you consider getting some schema therapy? That can really help with jealousy and controlling behaviours in relationships. It’s really positive that you can identify which behaviours and thoughts are likely ruining this good relationship you now have. It would be great if both you and your current partner could resume building your relationship without your fears taking over. A good relationship is a rare and beautiful thing. It’s funny how we try to control things to avoid feeling pain, and by doing so, we actually create a lot of pain for others and then ourselves, huh? Sometimes what seems intuitive is the worst course of action to take. Thanks for sharing part of yourself with us, and best wishes for your health and happiness x"
"Our short term goal actually is to move. His therapist asked us to keep her updated on whatever we knew because she could imagine him trying to track her down to hurt her, so that planted the thought in our minds that we should be on guard in the same way. My wife also wants to change her name because she doesn't want any association with her family, which could hopefully throw him off our tracks if he did consider being vindictive.

She feels guilty though, like she didn't do enough for him. She vowed to protect him from their parents but feels like she intervened too late. It's been really hard for her to let go of him and look past him being her brother. It leaves me wondering what people do to cope when they're family members end up being school shooters or rapists.
"
"Staying off the internet when I think I'm dying is a big one for me because I'll spend hours looking up symptoms. Distractions are good, like talking to a friend or watching a funny movie. Writing down my symptoms to talk to my doctor about at our next appointment helps me to stop obsessing over it in the moment. Breathing exercises. It also helps to remind myself I've felt weird things before and have survived so far. 

Idk what therapy is good for this specifically, but I've tried talk therapy (with DBT and CBT), mindfulness based stressed reduction (MBSR), and EMDR. The EMDR therapist I'm seeing specializes in trauma, which is where my health anxiety comes from, and has been the most helpful in combination with the right anti anxiety meds. But I know it's different for different people and can come out of other disorders like anxiety, depression, or OCD. Are you working with anyone already?

"I worked on crisis hotlines as a counselor.  If someone is having suicidal thoughts, we first assess how bad it is.  Do they have a plan, the means to execute that plan, and the intention to do so tonight?  If they have all those things, we try to talk them into going to the hospital instead.  If they intend to kill themself, refuse to go to the hospital, and say they are basically just calling to say goodbye, only then do we send an ambulance to get them (or rarely, the cops)  


It is perfectly appropriate to call one of these hotlines and say you have had thoughts of suicide but don't intend to kill yourself at this point.  You can call to talk about thoughts and we would encourage that.  


If you are clear that you're not in any danger tonight, the conversation will last anywhere from 7 to 15 minutes probably.  There are plenty of people who call these lines daily, so don't feel like a burden.  It's a short conversation, so don't expect them to remove your suicidal thoughts or fix any of your problems.  It's not therapy or medication.  


From the sounds of it, you are having thoughts of suicide on a regular basis but lack intent because you have things to live for like family and your dog.  It's good you have reasons to live, but thinking about suicide often means you desperately want an escape from current stressors.  So you should do something to start feeling better, but just calling a hotline once or twice will probably feel a little anti-climactic and not change your situation mutch.  I recommend some therapy and possibly anti-depressants.

&amp;#x200B;

Until then, just hang in there.  Fantasies about dying are just an escape the way fantasies about winning the lottery are an escape when you hate your job.  It's a symptom of a problem, but not the problem itself."
"Holy shit, this is me to the T. 

I absolutely understand everything you just said. I often go through those same situations and periods you expressed. One moment, I’m super shy. I don’t speak up. I don’t go out. I don’t mingle. The next, I’m bossing projects at work and making things happen. 

For quite a while, I couldn’t figure out for the life of me who I was. How could I go from being this outspoken, assertive guy to being timid, to having panic attacks. But this year man, was an eye opener. 

I got a brand new job early this year. It was quite a public one, one that requires you to be assertive and put yourself out there. There are days I’d be on it. Firm handshakes, batting away people’s bullshit, pushing back, pushing projects through. And there are other days I’m 15 mins into a networking mixer and I just can’t fucking take it anymore and I bolt. 

The single greatest lesson I’ve learnt this year: KNOW YOURSELF. You know yourself better than anyone else does. When I get panic attacks, I ask why it’s happening to me. What triggered it. Why can’t I hang in bars or at mixers and shake hands. Why do I all of a sudden become an alpha, outspoken inspiring guy to people around me. I went through a rough patch on that job. I did some really good work and fucked up on some too. 

But in the end, I had to resign. It was simple, I did not belong in an office at a 9am to 5pm job. With the skill, talent and experience I have, it would seem like I’d make exec before 30 but two things that are very important to be nowadays: **my health and my work** 

So I’ve taken a massive pay cut and taken a dive into freelancing. I’m back in school to get a psych degree, I work out now and I have more time to pursue the kind of projects I want to. Put simply, I am finding and putting forward a more consistent me. I’m approaching 30 now so I am more in control of things now. Don’t let the winds blow you in whatever direction. Take control. 

The more I write, the longer this gets. DM me if you want to chat.

"By being her friend. Which means being understanding, trustworthy, compassionate and firm. Listen to her problems but also don't be afraid to show tough love too. Sometimes all somebody wants is somebody to understand their struggle. Be there for her. And be her friend."
Good question. I came across random psychology articles that say if you do not socialize enough you can die younger and your brain will shrink. I assumed socializing means communicating with another human in person. They did not say how much is needed nor define terms.
"Honestly I've never said anything to anyone about what I go through.. im a pretty good 'actor' and even at my worst im my usual charming self on the outside.  

What do you mean chemical change ? .. I don't take any pills at all.  Thank you for taking the time to reply."
"I currently spend approximately  25% of my take home pay on therapy.  $1000/ month  For me it is worth it as I was close to giving up and ending everything before I found this person.

In my experience,  the better therapists don't accept insurance.  They don't have to."
"I get that, i tried explaining to my now ex, that i have two different people constantly arguing in my head. Theres the normal one and the one that just says crazy shit and drowns me with bad thoughts. I always find the bad one to be in more control and more compelling "
I read it. I think he has issues. I don't know that you would be able to convince him to see someone...so I have no idea of what you can do about it. He sounds passive-aggressive to me and that can be hard to deal with. Good luck though. Let me know if you need to talk!
"I'm glad meds work for you, I really am. But i was in a total fog for something like 2 years. My friends tell me stories I have absolutely no memory of and can't believe I did. I was sleeping 12+ hours a day most days. Life isn't worth living on those meds. Not for me. "
"I've been diagnosed with PTSD for some time. CPTSD seems near where I am, but I feel PTSD and DID would be a more fitting diagnosis. I still haven't felt like I've had a therapist I could open up to, hopefully soon, I have an appointment next Friday, so fingers crossed!"
"It's for people with a terminal illness, like cancer or the disease that shuts down your organs one by one. 
I've looked into it. 

Personally, I think assisted suicide should be allowed for mental illness, too, because sometimes those are terminal conditions, as well. "
"I’m in the same boat. I’m gonna be up all night anticipating the phone call I’m gonna have to make in........ 5 hours time. It’s bullshit, it really is. Not being able to disclose your depression and have some leniency to get your shit together. Life is fucked. "
"Psychology Today has an online tool to find therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and treatment centres in the United Stated, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. I went through about five therapists in one year until I found my current therapist three years ago. "
"Sorry people have said things like that to you. It's judgmental and disrespectful.

And it reflects more on their ignorance than anything about you.

I hope you can find better people to confide in, and stay away from the people who say those things as much as you can.
"
"Sorry to inform you but anti-depressant rarely cause decreased libido and you have to be older than 40, no they do not cause addiction/dependency and neither does it make it you tired. Anti-psychotics do decrease libido, tolerance and tiredness i think you mixed them up"
"Thank you for this, but no need to pester your father for someone on the internet. I think the main thing with me is that I have no intention of returning to my home town, there is too much history here. I am happy your father is able to be his best self though. Bless. "
Thank you so much. I actually went to get an evaluation because I'm feeling how I felt leading up to my last Suicide attempt. They pretty much tuned me away because I wasn't currently suicidal. Seems like no one really cares about your mental health until it's too late.
"Thanks for your analysis. I still think I might be too lucid and self aware to be hypomanic though. Do you believe a hypomanic episode can be induced even having been on an SSRI for only 8 days? 

What are other signs should I be aware of that are conducive to bipolar? "
"Thanks for your reply! I've never done drugs before in my life. Interesting thoughts, though. I wouldn't consider myself to be particularly intelligent but I think there is something to be said for living in the real world, as opposed to inside one's head. Thanks again."
"When my depression was at its worst, I went all day without any joy at all for months. When I slowly started coming out of it, and started feeling even the smallest bits of happiness, I knew the fight was well worth it.

Enjoy it, there’s plenty more to come your way."
"sure it’s difficult to find employment doing pottery but that shouldn’t  discourage you from looking. i would work at just a regular job for now and just keep searching. do it on the side, try to sell your work. There’s hope out there to do anything you want to do"
"I felt terrible after-party for a long while too. I was raised in a deeply religious environment growing up. I was taught that every moment I spent for my own pleasure was a sin. Drinking was a sin. Smoking. Basically anything you did for yourself, so long as it wasn’t to help others. Now that I look back at it, it was so stupid. I am no longer religious in any way, and what I did was truly laughable. 

As long as you’re not affecting your studies and health and have some self-control, you shouldn’t feel that way. "
"I was in the same boat. I'm very overweight for my age, but I just couldn't find motivation to start. (Depression is fun yay) But starting is the hardest and most important step. There's no way to force yourself to start, you just gotta say ""I WILL do this."" 

And some weight loss tips. You don't necessarily need to go to the gym, you can just do simple things like walk to work/school instead of driving, or by doing something fun like dancing.(energetic dancing can get your heart pumping in the same way that running can)"
"If he loves you, he'll be supportive and understanding. Try not to beat yourself up about it, either. Rlapse doesn't negate or somehow make invalid the time you went without it. 7 months without it is amazing- you've come so far! You haven't lost all that time and you aren't starting over from square one. Instead, relapse highlights areas we still need to work on. That's okay. Don't be too hard on yourself and don't forget that recovery is a process, not perfection, so keep fighting. Hope you feel better soon, take care!"
"Thanks for the help. I know I fixate on things until they're ""fixed"" in my mind, so maybe that's part of it. I have, in the past, chewed my nails simply because they needed to be stubs, not because I was anxious. Or I would write and rewrite and rewrite a sentence or a paragraph or a paper until my mind says ""it's fixed"". One time, I rewrote the same sentence seventeen times until I was allowed to continue.

But yeah, I'll look into professional help and maybe some meditation or something. I'm not sure. Thank you though."
"I’m by no means trained in EMDR, but I have spoken to a number of certified EMDR therapists. One of the most interesting things to me is that the client does not even have to verbalize the event(s), they can choose to just think of them (this is done through the guidance of the therapist). The eye movement desensitizes the client by “pulling up” the neurological connection that’s been strengthened over time and replacing it with a less distressing response. This is extremely simplified, because like I said, I am not an expert on this intervention. But it really is something that had helped many people because it works directly with the physiological response that causes distress in every day life (in the case of OP’s father it would be the daily panic attacks). "
"Thank you so so much. 

I do often feel guilty about many things, and I also feel that my mother uses manipulation tactics in order to make me feel bad for, what I think, is her own “resentment” (using that loosely) for not being able to pursue her own dreams as she was ‘unable’ to given the circumstances (me). I do recognize this and I try to remind myself that it’s not me... but it gets exhausting and often leaves me feeling really shitty about myself. 

I refuse to give up my dream and passion. Whatever sacrifices I have to make I will make it happen... it just sucks feeling like your own parents are rooting against you &amp; having to convince myself that the problem is not (entirely) me. 

The video was wonderful by the way. Thank you so much for sharing!! "
"You will have to come to grips with that. A lot of being happy is finding joy in the things around you, in the people you surround yourself with. Sharing in the human experience together. So if you attribute those things to 'pulling the wool over your eyes' then your perspective needs adjusted.

Killing yourself because you think you are behind others is a pretty dumb reason to be frank. Obviously there are people ""further along"" than you think you are, even younger than you. There are also a large sect of people who live their entire lives like that and really only figure it out after it is too late to enjoy it. Don't be one of those people. You are on the right track if you are getting to this level of questioning things. Never stop asking questions, learning, adapting."
"As a teacher, this is worrying to hear about. Teachers are trusted people in positions authority and power and can have a great deal of influence over their students. 

I teach Sociology (to adults) and the subject matter can at times get into difficult (read 'risky') territory - areas such as terrorism, Western values, torture, race, gender, mental health etc are necessary points of discussion. There is an inherrent risk that in a room of 20 people, someone could misinterpret the message. That leaves me with a responsibility to present these ideas very carefully. It is possible that your teacher may have just articulated themselves poorly (I'm not saying this is the case, just that it's possible based on the limited information I have). Regardless, you should definitely report this to another teacher, the safeguarding team at your school/college or a head of department. At best your teacher was very careless, at worst they are aboslutely out of order, bordering on dangerous and abusive. 

Sorry to hear your experience. 

"
"Congrats!! You are one year of living (vs surviving). 

You are one year of not falling into the traps of your own messed-up chemistry. One year you managed to hold controls instead of giving up command. 

Be proud - be ridiculously proud. You should! It feels amazing and scary and weird but... look at what that means. One year of being in control.

I bet a year ago you would never feel you'd be able to regain control... but you did. Look at your older self and thank them for surviving and tell them ""I'm taking over now, thanks for everything you taught me"".

I can feel my old self as a child, looking at me at all times to make sure I'm fighting for ... my older self well being.

Amazing work! I'm so proud of you internet stranger!

I always go back to one speech that helps me put things in perspective when I think I want to end things, might not work for you but I'll share it - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) .

&amp;#x200B;

Have a fantastic day - you deserve it."
"Normally I would gladly advise you to start meditation on your own, but you have mentioned abuse and trauma in your past and that you have been suppressing much of the pain. That pain can come flooding back and if you aren't prepared for it, it can be quite difficult to deal with.

I am an intermediate level meditator and I experience this still, to a lesser degree. I literally just got up from a sit where around 5 minutes in I got an intensely strong feeling of sadness. I stayed with it and felt it and it passed, but this isn't the first time.

If you have someone you trust that you can do it with, that might be a good way to start if you can't or don't want to find a trained therapist.

Please look up the books by Jon Kabat-Zinn, which are designed to introduce people to mindfulness and include guided meditations that are helpful not just for technique but reassurance.

Also, the comment ""Radical acceptance, man"" sounds like it's a joke but that's actually the name of a book by Tara Brach that was a life-changer for me. "
"A couple years back after I was laid off from my job, I fell into a depression and started to really hyper analyze my entire life/thoughts/everything. My wife at the time was really supportive and it turned into us both hyper analyzing each other and trying to ""fix"" our problems. It created an unhealthy mental dependence and all we were able to focus on at that point was the negative qualities which eventually lead to her ending our 8 year relationship. This was 2 weeks ago and my social anxiety and hyper analyzing has skyrocketed. What I've realized so far is that no amount of thinking has helped because they are all negative and I just get stuck in an endless cycle of self hate and what I could/should have done. What has helped me is reaching out to as many people as I know (that are willing to listen) and getting the thoughts out of my head, and people have been a lot more supportive then I would have originally thought. Trying to go out in the area around where I live and find some roots and things I enjoy outside so I'm not stuck inside in my head also helps. It's easier to talk to people if they're already doing something you also enjoy and lots of people like to teach you how to do things they enjoy. I hope at least some of this has been helpful. Just hang in there! "
"I'm sorry you're going through a rough time. I know it's hell... Please know that you are not alone and remember not to take a permanent action based on temporary feelings.     
    
I totally agree with other advice here- 1) find a psychiatrist and get yourself evaluated 2) Definetely get a new therapist (I went through 4 before I found my amazing therapist... been with her for 3 years and she has literally saved my life twice while I was at my lowest.    
    
   
With that being said, there may be an underlying medical illness (non-psychiatric) causing your symptoms (such as hypothyroidism) and you should definitely see your general doctor and get bloodwork.  Although they're separate diseases, depression is sometimes a symptom of hypothyroidism. Your doctor can figure out if your depression is because of hypothyroidism and test you for thyroid disorders.  Endocrine, neurologic, infectious, and vitamin deficiencies could also be causing your depression. Regardless, you are so much stronger than you know. The fact that you posted here is no accident.  There are lots of resources available to you as well as a supportive and understanding community here that will always lend an ear, share our experiences (both setbacks and progress) and empathize. Please don't lose hope. "
&lt;3 to you!!!

Okay thanks! :)
"Okay, thank you"
Please comment
Thank you &lt;3
Thank you &lt;3
Thanks so much
Thanks so much
Thanks so much
Thanks so much
Thanks so much
Yeah I am too.
"Yes, absolutely"
You’re great.
ok. thanks. bye
your thoughts?
"&gt; I really don’t think my problems are bad enough to warrant a need for professional help, though.




Yeah but it's always better to be safe rather than sorry. Just make sure that you're completely honest with them about how you feel. Do that and you'll be alright."
At least we aren't on our own with these thoughts. That's a good thing to realise that it's just life moving so quickly. We need to fight that with making the most of it and filling it with just what matters to us than thinking we should live to matter to everyone else.
"Have you ever heard of SMART recovery? It's the only one I know of that doesn't use that higher power nonsense. I'm sure there's others though, maybe people here can point you in the right direction. Feel free to chat away to me if you need to, I'm always happy to chat. "
I was literally in the SAME situation. My ex basically begged me to go on antidepressants because he was mad I wouldn’t be in the mood to have sex with him when he wanted. Went on them and they killed me libido even more (jokes on him). Broke up with him shorty after.
I wish there was a way to volunteer to be someone who gives a damn. I would 100% be down for listening to someone and giving them a hug. No it’s not going to solve their problems but sometimes having someone in your life who cares is what one need for therapy to help.
I would definitely consider the possibility of you being gay and take a look into your sexuality. Being gay is nothing to be ashamed of. Repressing it may cause more damage and emotional turmoil than acknowledging it. Don't rule it out until you know for sure. Good luck.
I’m not gonna say you have a certain disorder when you’re not professionally diagnosed with it. The first thing that pops into my mind is maybe you were extremely tired? Sometimes waking up from a vivid dream or nightmare can be behind the feeling of years going by.
"Someone once told me “before you consider yourself depressed, make sure you aren’t just surrounded by assholes.” So your theory holds up in my eyes. I’m currently going through this with my therapist as we try to identify the negative affective people in my life."
"To me, that sounds less like something he's doing to treat your problems, and more like something he's doing for his own well being. He recognizes that he can't stop you from having overwhelming moodshifts, and he's realized that it isn't good for him to be a part of it."
"Yeah...If you haven't guessed, I am a bit older than most people here (or at least possibly). I am going to be 48 in February and I am suffering from a disorder normally seen in teenagers/young adults. I am mentally stuck in my teens, so there ya go. Good luck to you. :)"
"Yes.  There is often a genetic component to mental illness.  Read [Three Generations, No  Imbeciles](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Generations-No-Imbeciles-Eugenics/dp/0801898242/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537379675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=three+generations+no+imbeciles)"
"agree with everyone else on here. go to the doc first. after that, consider mental health. Are you eating properly? i remember i had a phase where i was awfully nauseous, and part of it was because i was so anxious i literally couldn't eat and that made my stomach upset."
"Be as open and honest as you can with your therapist - holding back just makes it harder for them to help you (especially if you’ve only been granted a certain number of sessions). Basically, you will get out of it what you put into it, so do the work and give your best effort. It is absolutely worth it! Ideally you will learn some coping skills (and when they tell you to practice, do it!!) and explore what your triggers are and how to deal with them.

I’m really happy for you. It’s hard work but it will pay off. :)"
"I hated CBT. It was patronising and pointless. I already know how to control my thoughts and emotions. I don't need training for that. I need to experience positive emotions once in a while instead of only negative ones. No amount of CBT has ever helped me with that, and neither have any of the antidepressants I've been prescribed. I've always just run away from my problems and buried them deep inside instead. That is *not* a good solution btw, I'm just saying it's the only one that has actually worked for me, personally."
"It sounds like a social worker might be your best starting point. They will know and have access to a lot of community resources that might be of help, and solving this sort of issue without being an outlet for your feelings is more in their wheelhouse than, say, a therapist. Another option, depending on the age of your family member (if they are an adult they will have to consent) is to take them to a psychiatrist/psychologist to be evaluated - having a concrete idea of what is wrong can help them form a treatment plan. "
"Oh no things like that are cool, I understand those type of posts I used to post about having anxiety about school and meeting people back in the day on Yahoo Answers lol. It's when people specifically say they've been diagnosed, and haven't. The main problem for me is when they're people I know or have gotten to know who I find out are just lying or assuming they've got something. I'd rather they just be honest and say ""I think I have (bipolar for example)"" and say their story. It's just the dishonesty that I don't get. "
"Doesn't read like NPD to me. There's definitely grandiosity, but NPD also requires a need for admiration that I'm not seeing here. It also has to be a pervasive pattern across most/all situations, which isn't met by this happening just in isolation in a certain circumstance.

Also, OP doesn't complain about substantial functional impairment, which is a requirement of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia spectrum or another psychotic disorder could be, though. OP also doesn't seem to match criterion A. They do have delusions, most likely, though this could be more compulsion, but they would also need to have hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and/or negative symptoms. While they could have these, there's no evidence of them in the post."
"I can't. We have 4 kids still at home and I still love him so much...I know I know. That sounds like something a 20-something would say, not a 47 year old grown woman. When things are good, they are really good. When things are bad...only SOMETIMES they get really bad, then things blow over and he acts like NOTHING went on, yet the scars remain. It kills me that I am 100% behind him for everything. He just lost his job (got fired) and I didn't even freak out on him. I was OK with it (not financially but emotionally) because I could see how unhappy he was at that job. He can't seem to do the same for me...and I have considered leaving once the youngest is 16 or so (all the others will be grown), but he is only 8 now. I have 8 more years before I can decide. I am so torn. :("
"I live in the UK, so I wouldn’t understand and don’t understand how it works there but here is some advice.

Try not to approach your situation as fatal, treat it as a circumstance that is temporary. It will be hard at first but the mentality of wanting to leave will open up so many avenues for yourself. 

As for money, there are ways to make money or save money. Over time... the next train..bus.. tram or whatever, Take that shit right into town or wherever your opportunities are and run with it.

Public housing, places to stay. The world is kind.. you just have to look very hard.

As for your boyfriend and his step dad.
Show him the post you just put and let him know you just want a new start. Offer to help out whatever it takes. Just make sure you get out of there before you end up like your parents.

I’m sorry if I offended you in any way!

I’m searching for answers too, I’m lost.. I’m broken... Im a mess. I feel alone and I feel drained.

Make leaps.. I promise you one day you’ll look back and be thankful."
"I am/was in a similar situation. I was planning on ending my life at the end of September/beginning of October. I was going to get my ""affairs"" in order, celebrate my kid's birthdays and that would be it. I've dealt with mental illness for over 10 years; been in therapy, hospitalized, and tried a bunch of meds. I also have other chronic illnesses and it's constantly overwhelming, I have no quality of life- always worried about everyone and everything else. 

I've lived my whole life telling myself ""things will get better""...but I turned 26 and was writing a will so...

I was thinking fentanyl or another strong sedative as well. 

Not gonna throw God at you- I'm agnostic; not gonna throw family and friends at you- the way I see it, their life will go on eventually. I don't know you, besides this, we might have nothing in common. I'd like to consider myself highly intelligent, but that presents its own problems because it's hard to ""fit in""- I don't want to fit in anyways, and then I have so many failed dreams because I put other people first.

Anyways, I made a promise to someone very dear to me that I would try treatment one more time...it's a bittersweet feeling. I'm heavily medicated, and will taper down at some point, but I'm actually able to cope. I think some people need medicine, whether it be a little or a lot...I tried for awhile on my own, but I need it.

I still have an out though, the promise was I'd try one more time; but if it got too bad, after a reasonable amount of ""trying"" had been done, I could take my own life if I chose to"".

Maybe you should try that, don't know what your situation is, but adjust it to your needs.

If not, just make things easy as possible for those who have to come behind you- write a letter or something, don't leave people guessing, etc."
"here's the thing. Any significant mental illness is a big drain on quality of life. I dont know how much better your life would be if you were coping better, but if you can see it improved, then my advice would be to at least *try* therapy with a skilled practitioner and see if you find benefit. From the way you write, and your comments, you sound 'stuck' and want to figure things out yourself (maybe to save money)?  I can totally understand that. However, *doing it alone is generally not advised*, and trying to recover using some reliable method - doesnt have to be 'therapy', although thats a common recourse - is. 

&amp;#x200B;

A great alternative to 1:1 therapy is group work. Joining a group offers some different advantages over counselling. Being with people in a similar boat, who have overcome a lot themselves, offers insider knowledge and skills that are not available in 1:1. Also the social support that groups offered is generally considered extremely beneficial to people who access them. 

&amp;#x200B;

If your local mental health centres offer courses, this is another method, with a different set of benefits. So, no, Therapy is not mandatory, its not even essential for everyone, but it could be *for you* and thats not something you can know without at least trying it. If its just too inaccessible to you due to cost or whatever, dont try and do it alone; connect with others and try to find an alternative that will help you move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a very strong body of established knowledge in this subreddit about *how to choose a therapist,* if thats the route you opt for*.* A google search may local mental health groups and courses in your area. If you dont see anything, it may be worth contacting local mental health centres to see if they can hook you up. "
"If you want to read something nice and sweet, I beg you stop reading now. I tell it like it is because I am as direct as they come, even if it put's ME in a bad light.

Now, you have a lot of growing up to do. You're being VERY selfish and it makes me think you're a Narcissistic parent seeking validation from your disabled husband and those poor children. You need to stop a minute and look at the big picture. Then once you look at the big picture...Frame it and hang it up in that skull of yours until you can't forget it. Those are Children. You cannot possibly tell me you love them the way you have been behaving. I understand you have issues that you need to address, but you address them as much as you can without letting your children get effected by them. They will remember the bad times a lot more than the good if you keep this up. The fact that your husband even wants you back in the house with them after 4 weeks shows he still believes in you. He still wants to give you a chance to prove your value to him and those kids. Because sooner or later you may just prove you are worthless and nothing more than a distraction to everything good in all of their lives.

​

Now, I tell you all that to tell you this. I myself am diagnosed with Major Depression, and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I looked in the mirror long ago and realize I am never going to change in the way I see the world...which is ONE BIG GAME. All I think about is how I can maneuver and use people to end up on the winning end. But after thinking that, I realize it is ME just being an ASSHOLE and I revert back to the way I know I should be behaving...I manipulate my own thoughts into believing i'm not who I really am...It took a long time to get it down right but it starts with accepting who you are. Are you a good person inside and just can't help but cause problems for others to make the attention come back to you? If this is true you need to stop and reflect on what you really want in life and just live each day one day at a time. You'll never get what you truly want by bitching and complaining and behaving like a fool who needs validation from everyone....They will laugh at you...which is why no one but myself even bothered replying to you...Get your head out of your ass and LIVE FOR THOSE CHILDREN and be a good mother. MY mother was a drunk and my dad beat my ass almost daily for a very long time....It cause me to develop this overvaluing/overcompensating personality...And I have grown to love myself even with that flaw...I just learned to work around it and hurt as few people as possible in the process...Which is what you MUST learn.

"hey,   
your post was very sad to read. I'm sorry you are struggling so much with everything. I don't even need to know you tell you that are absolutely NOT a failure. Everyone has potential and capacity for greatness, but sometimes we just get a bit lost and don't know how to access that greatness within us. Everyone also has the capacity to improve their lives, no matter how difficult their external circumstances are. It's discouraging when everything seems so shitty and your life just seems to be accumulating in shittiness, but it doesnt have to be that way forever, dig deep and find your inner strength, your real worth. You seem to focus more on your weaknesses- things you suck at or don't compare to others, (living at home, no car, no gf etc) rather than what strengths or skills you do possess. Even if you suck at everything (which is unlikely)- many skills can be learnt, even if they aren't innate. So what is stopping you from learning and growing? it's not gonna help if you wake up everyday and remind yourself of all the things you suck at, they may be true, but it doesnt mean you need to focus on it regularly to further bring yourself down. Focus on things you are good at, skills that have the capacity to develop, start with small goals, baby steps, even if its something very minor like just cleaning up after yourself or taking care of yourself in some way. No one can give you all the answers, lay it out for you, or make your life better. YOU are the only person who has the power to change your life, you have the power to focus on your strengths, manage your weaknesses (but don't feed into them), you are the only one who can decide what you will pursue, only you know what goals you have. So don't talk to the person who has the power to have a better life in such a harsh manner (yourself!). Don't label yourself a failure and loathe over the things you have not attained.   


Also, whats with the burning hatred for random people who are mean online? Theres some pretty horrible people out there, and no matter what you do, they'll always be horrible and nasty. Dealing with them is BAD energy, negative and hateful. Don't surround yourself in that kinda energy. There's people that have been through horrible shit, and mistreated their whole lives- yet have so much love to give others. Thats the kinda people you wanna be around or pay attention to. (even if its online.   


Btw Comparison is VERY unhealthy and harmful for anyone's self esteem and well being. The world is unfair,once you accept this without any bitterness, you may feel a lot better.  Some people are born lucky, and some are born into shitty lives, but our external world does not determine our destiny. You underestimate how much power you actually have. If you are open, look into resources available for people struggling with mental health. I find TED talks or goal cast videos to be incredibly inspirational. Not in a way that compares, (my life is still better than theirs etc) but it really proves that humans are so resilient and powerful. As are you. I wish you the best of luck. I hope you start treating yourself with more compassion, because you really deserve a chance at life too.

"Do you know what anxiety, depression and OCD can do to your thoughts? Thoughts become TORTURE and lately all I want to do is sleep or get high to escape my thoughts. I'm not sure what the point of your comment is other than to brag about being less ill, or not ill at all."
"Everyone has a skill you just haven't noticed it.

We don't know how you look like, every one has someone that looks up to them.

You should go first for a psychologist and let them help you, they can even tell you which therapy is better.

Live life and stop surviving it"
"Honestly, I think many people feel that way too. It's a lifelong journey to come to any understanding of who we are. It's such a hard and complex question to answer. You are your strengths and your values, whatever they may be, they make up who you are as a person. &lt;3 "
"How long have had him for? I had a traumatic and abusive childhood and was suicidal at a young age but when someone gave us a cat it brought me out of depression. Sadly, he was an outdoor cat and only lived for 9 years. I never got another cat again but I'm still fighting"
"I agree. You think you don't have depression, but you describe exactly that depression is.

Please, go talk to someone.  

Just the fact you post it on here seams like you want to hear from people, and you want that little kick in the butt to go and do at least one thing."
"I got a handful.

- Friends and family
- Interesting shit to learn
- Music
- The small possibility of getting a girlfriend before I'm 40
- Out of spite of the people who wish people like me weren't thriving
- And finally, to live long enough to see how the world will end."
"I got so excited as I was reading your post!  It's very hard to find the right combination to make you feel good and it seems that you got it. It doesn't sounds like you're maniac, just sounds like you're a balanced person who's enjoying life. Hoping that 'glow' remains! "
"I hope you figure it out. I think things get better. Try and accept yourself a bit, I think that brings some peace. Try and cherish things. Anyways, I think it's better to have emotions than to be numb.. I think it's a good direction.. I feel like crying can be cleansing."
"I just watched a Markipier video. :D He and Jacksepticeye are my favorites. I also like watching Nickelodeon (SpongeBob and now I Am Frankie, which I REALLY like) to cheer myself up...and to distract myself. Thanks for this. I am grateful for nice people like you guys. :)"
"I think maybe it's because those two are becoming more widespread? In todays age, especially with social media and stuff it wouldn't surprise me if they are far more common, whereas OCD and stuff don't 'grow' from the same type of stimulus or whatever if that makes sense?"
"I'm glad you know you need to see a doctor. I hope you can do that soon.

You sound like you are dealing with something in the anxiety/depression spectrum, though I am not qualified to diagnose you.

If you need to talk, go ahead. I am sure people here would like to help."
"If you think something else might be off, definitely try to get help. Like if you can't function for the rest of the week. If it takes a day for you to get back up and be productive, that's fine. But if it lasts more than a couple days then there might be some other issue"
"It also depends on your age; it might help to find a space where you can be alone - bedroom, shower, even the toilet! - where you can just shut out the noise of the actual voices and try to quiet the memory-voices and just be yourself, even if it's five minutes at a time!"
"It sounds unusual. Go speak to your doctor, nobody on here can offer a diagnosis so I would recommend speaking to your doctor. Any number of conditions can have overlap so it would be impossible, and disingenuous, to offer any suggestion of what it could be. Best of luck!"
"Man, I’ve had panic attacks and depressive episodes before. You’re not being over dramatic, I know how you feel. I hope you find a new one soon. If you ever need to talk, feel free to DM me, or make a post on the tons of support groups here on Reddit. Get well soon :)"
"Not really to be honest, I think our appts are just talking how I’m feeling and discussing medication and where to next. Before seeing him I was going through weekly counselling which I didn’t feel helped either. 
Maybe I am just a shitty person that can’t be helped"
"Probably should take it easy on any new substance.  If you try it you have to treat it like an experiment.  See if you reach an effective dose or not before getting adverse effects.  

It isn't cool to push drugs but he isn't any worse than all the other people that do.  "
"That is horrible!

Related to this is the fact that victims of mental illness and traumatic events often sound very uncertain when they do reach out for help.  Poorly educated people associate confidence with honesty, so shaking, stuttering victims aren't taken seriously."
"The only flaws are other people, and therapists antagonizing me and telling me it's all my problems and faults, wanting me to see other people's ""positives"", too, which pretty much denies their wrong-doings and my perceptions so they can go kindly fuck themselves for that"
"This. I've been Sertraline-free for nearly three weeks now and had mood swings alongside mild dizziness episodes and some headaches. That being said, it passed relatively quickly (think 5 days), after I had been on medication for roughly 4 and a half months.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Well, my ESA is a cat. She's an indoor so that's about it. They are recognized enough that people will accomodate you on non-pet buildings (my case), not charge you the pet fee, and also for travel/transport. Where else would you want to see more flexibility, for example?"
"Alright, one problem at a time, and good job on making a post! Been there and even reaching out on Reddit is difficult. 

I think the fatigue is probably related to your depression, are you speaking to anyone professionally? :)

Also how much are you eating, and are you drinking water? Your diet can go a long way, believe it or not! I used to feel extremely tired all the time, and this was why.

EDIT: Also, are you on any medication? That could potentially cause fatigue, especially if you've just started on new medication."
"I am a 46m and experience the same thing. I have a counseling background but still am baffled at where the thoughts come from. I have a degenerative neuromuscular disease and know that the thoughts are somehow linked to my pain. Simply cause when the pain is intolerable the thoughts are too. However I have learned over the past 2 years that I cannot take pain meds as they put me in a mental state that I may/may not expedite those thoughts. I too am just venting, however would love to make them go away. Good luck my friend."
"The truth is we don't hate all people with BPD, we're simply in pain too. Frankly this is why we're a support group. It's a place for Nons trying to look out and help one another overcome the pitfalls from our own personal experience when dealing with BPD individuals.

It may look like hatred but deep down it isn't. Try to understand that we're actually suffering due to the damage some Borderlines have put us through. We know that you're all different, so please don't take everything as if it is directed at you personally."
"Hello friend. 

If you are attending college, I suggest seeing a counselor at your university. I went through a traumatic experience recently and even after one counseling session at my university I felt better. Counselors always listen to you and they want you to feel better and to be your best self.

If you have a job, see what therapy or counseling services your job provides. Where I live, some employees have benefits that allow them up to 6 counseling sessions a year free of charge. I don't know where you live but if you are an employee and you have these benefits check them out.

If you really need help then your therapist/counselor might refer you to a doctor, but until then you'll have someone to talk to who will never judge you and who will always want to help you. "
"I know it can be extremely hard to get on meds, but please think about these two points:

1. Is it possible that the anxiety/depression itself is making you feel that seeking treatment is wrong, dangerous,or a sign of weakness? If anxiety can make you see your enviroent and relationships as harder or scarier, then isn't it possible it would making getting help harder too?

2. You said you prefer to have eyour body work things out naturally, but I'm guessing that you've mostly experienced short term things like colds or minor injuries that your body can heal from rather quickly. If you were experiencing sore throat, or headaches r a bleeding wound for months on end would you ignore it in hopes that your body ""sorts it out naturally?""

Hope this helps and hop you feel better "
"Hey man, that's alright! I am fucking 34, same shit  I was feeling and saying about my most recent ex. As well as a few others. 

Take it like this bud, everything in life that will happen directly to you  it's either a blessing. Or a lesson. 
I knows it's the first real connection you had. Take it and cherish that man! Whatever happens here with her, coming up in the future, let it be. Yeah it's hard. Shit even harder because its the first experience. There will be more of them man! You got life to live. A fucking lot of it lol. 
I'm sorry it's rough and feelings are this exact thing. Welcome to living and being in the dating world!!
Older motherfuckers have been there bro. Look, my advice, learn now to try your best and then move on man. Take a moment for you!! Thats right. Self love is key buddy! So just breathe. Calm yourself and your emotions. Get some rest if its nighttime wherever you may be, realize that this is not the rest of your life man! You love someone. That's awesome. So let her go then. That's what love is 
"
"Usually, when SSRIs make your depression worse, it’s a sign that depression—however major it may be—isn’t your only problem. A good example is bipolar disorder, as you mentioned. (Personally I’m bipolar and was on SSRIs for about seven years before I was accurately diagnosed. All of them made my depression worse or seemed to have no effect at all.) But bipolar disorder isn’t the only mental illness that is affected by SSRIs in an overall negative way. BPD, severe anxiety, schizoaffective disorder, and schizoid personality disorder can all present as and/or involve severe depression. 

You should get a second opinion from a different psychiatrist; that’d be my advice to you. If you’ve tried many or all of the different SSRIs and none of them work for you, something else is at play. If you’ve only tried a few I would encourage you to also consider trying other or atypical SSRIs. 

One more thing: I take duloxetine for my depression and it’s the only thing that’s ever worked for me. 10/10 would recommend. "
"Are you seeing any mental health professionals? If you're worried about distinguishing between real and not-real it's probably a good idea to discuss with them ways you can ""reality test"" things you're unsure of. 

Also, I think you should keep in mind ... even people who don't have problems with delusions sometimes get lied to by their friends. For example, it happened to me before that my friends reassured me I was just imagining things ... then I found out I wasn't imagining it at all, and I had been right to doubt them, but those two years of them lying to me about it had really confused me and made it difficult for me to trust my own judgements. It's also a thing that happens in abusive relationships (""gaslighting""). So, it's definitely a thing that happens, and it's always upsetting and confusing, even if you're not someone who struggles with delusions. 

It really really sucks that your mental health problems interfered in this way and made it easier for your ""friends"" to take advantage of you :( I think most people won't be like that, so you could try just making new friends. If it becomes a larger pattern, or if you're worried about it, maybe you could see a psychologist or therapist to work on some techniques to help you avoid people who will mislead you like that. "
"Hey, I'm sorry to hear you're having such a hard time. Mental illnesses suck and being Bi Polar must be really challenging. I suffer from c-ptsd and anxiety/depression so while it's not the same, I really relate to struggling with 'acceptance'. I remember telling my therapist over and over that I didn't want to get better, I wanted to *be* better, and that it was so unfair that I had to work so hard just to get to the level of normality everyone around me took for granted. I didn't want to have to work on myself and resented therapy and medication and being depressed. But as with all things, coming to terms with it takes time. I'm a little further along now and I don't get so upset, I've learned how to manage myself a little better and how to get through tough spots and difficult days without letting them overwhelm me.

You have to keep trying. Not everything works the first time, or even the second. I've had eight different therapists doing all sorts of things. I've been on as many different medications and I'm sure I'll be on them for a while yet. Try to remember that you're worth spending the time getting better and that it's okay to grieve over the life you could have had if you weren't like this, but that you're still very valuable, lovable and able to have a good life. "
"I currently work as a barista at Starbucks and I deal with this on a daily basis. My approach is being honest with people. For example, today we had 3 people call in sick so we were super short staffed and it was very obvious to customers. It was non stop for several hours straight. In between the chaos everyone has to take their breaks and you would think you’d be able to relax on your break but you can’t really because you know in less than 15 mins you have to get back to the chaos. 
Me- Hi, how are you? 
Customer-Good and you? 
Me- It’s been crazy busy today and we are super short staffed. Had a few people call in sick so the few of us working are working as fast as we can. 
*this allows the customer to know what’s going on and have compassion towards me and my coworkers* 
This was just an example. I had a time when our family dog passed away and I was working that evening. I wasn’t my usual bubbly self and I explained why and again customers were very compassionate and even shared their stories about losing their pets. 

When I have customers who reply, I’m okay, depending on their tone and body language I can usually judge whether that’s a I want to share more or not. I usually always dig a little deep. I’ll make a cute remark like just okaaayyy and that gets them to open up. 

It sounds like you are a self-aware person and awareness is key. You eventually get good at reading people when you working in customer service. People’s body language, tone, expressions, mannerisms all tell a lot, as do our own. "
"&gt; I've recently been slowly pushing myself out of my comfort zone by doing simple things like saying hi to people with a smile, and not mumbling, stuff I'd never do even a month ago.

That's great! That's a good small exercise you can do to help improve your anxiety. Once you start seeing a therapist, they will assign you ""homework"" like that to do on a regular basis as part of exposure therapy and **things will get better**.

&gt; As far as staying positive, I really try to but I just can't help to realize that I'm a loser and will probably die alone.

I want you to know that you're **NOT** a loser but your anxiety and depression makes you think you are. It's called 'stinking thinking' and it's caused by your mental illness. Almost everyone with depression and anxiety feels the same way. I know I have felt like that for most of my life and there are days even now that I still feel like that and that's why it's crucial for me to continue working on my mental health and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. This is why it's so important for you to get the proper help now so you can get better and start to live your best life.

Have you made an appointment with your primary care yet? That's really the first step to getting better so it's up to you.

Would you like me to help you find a therapist or psychiatrist in your area? If so, just let me know what insurance you have and what state and county or closest big city is to you so I can find what's in your area.

Where do you live? I live in Massachusetts and am always looking for new friends and to meet new people as my anxiety tells me to do the opposite. 

What are your interests? What do you like to do for fun? Do you get any exercise on a regular basis? 

What are you going to college for? Are you a freshman or sophomore? Have you considered switching to a 4-year college after community college? I started out at a community college myself before transfering to a 4-year college. Even community colleges have all sorts of student groups that you could join or get involved in."
"Hi! It sounds like you're having a really tough time. I'll spare you the details, but I can absolutely relate to the feeling of your life falling apart around you and one thing after the next kicking you to your knees. It's a horrible feeling and it makes you wonder when it's ever going to stop, and that adds a lot of fear as it makes your brain struggle to anchor itself onto anything. It really sucks and I feel for you.

One thing that really stood out to me is that you mentioned you've started birth control recently. That can really mess with your hormones and throw a lot of things out of whack. I would recommend talking to your doctor and describing your symptoms and see if he can take you off it. It sounds like it's the last thing you need right now. My only concern is that coming off them might be complicated as well, so it might be better overall to see it through and let your body finish adjusting - your doctor will be able to advise you on that infinitely better than I can. But it does sound, from what you've described, that this might be playing a significant part here, or could even be the root cause of this new state you're in.

I think it's a good thing that your boyfriend was honest with you about about not knowing how to help you. It's better than naively thinking he knows what's best for you and causing more harm than good. It's totally okay if he feels out of his depth, so try to be understanding. I would recommend giving him simple instructions for what he can do to help you. There's no shame in that on either side. Sometimes people need to be told what to do. Even if it's as simple as ""I just need you to sit with me and tell me I'm safe"". Remember that he's not letting you down by not knowing what to do, and you're not doing your relationship a disservice by spelling it out in simple terms.

Try to see a therapist if you can. You have a lot going on and talking through your problems with a trained professional will likely really help you to process everything.

Finally, remember that what you're going through is in no small part because of real, legitimate problems. You're struggling to deal with it, but that's a normal reaction to all this stress and tragedy. You're handling it well, despite how you might feel at the moment.

I hope things get better for you and hopefully this gives you a few ideas to help you improve things even just a little bit. If you want to unload to a random internet stranger who can relate to you and won't judge you, message me any time and I will always listen.

Take care of yourself.

"I have ADHD and you just described me. I lie because I’m embarrassed I haven’t been more productive/motivated and I’m not at all where I want to be. Lying makes me feel like I’m somebody better, more likeable. Everything else is anxiety and him not loving himself. "

"I'm going through a similar thing, but I haven't even picked up the phone to make an appointment yet, so you've gotten further than me. Just take it one step at a time I guess. You already have the appointment, so just make it a goal to at least get to the parking lot on the date and time of your appointment. Then make it your goal to go inside. Taking little baby steps can really help with the anxiety. And don't worry, doctor's aren't there to judge, they're there to help you get better. 

I hope you feel better soon &lt;3"
"Maybe she is ill, maybe just weird and irrational. In any case, her behaviours are negatively affecting you so you have a right to question them. It seems like you are old enough to stand up for yourself. She can't keep you like a prisoner against your will for very long if you resist and try to set things up for yourself.

Trust your gut. You deserve to live your own life. Try to get out as much as possible and establish a safety net for yourself (a job, money, etc). If you can take care of yourself, she can't control you."
"The first thing you need to do is stop putting yourself down. Stop worrying about how other's perceive you. And start focusing on yourself. If you want to improve your self-esteem issues, then start going to the gym. Working out is a great way to feel better about yourself. Also, and you might not want to hear this, you need to get yourself into therapy. Group therapy would be preferred. Especially if you're having problems with your relationships with other people. Do this now or you'll possibly regret it later on in life."
"Theres so much uncertainty in everything dude! Some things you can't ""think"" about it, you just gotta ""act"" on it and let it play out. I know that sounds scary. As someone with lots of anxiety and wanting to control outcomes, it's not easy to just let go, and let things be. Even if your parents aren't encouraging and supportive, you still should see a professional because it will help you become more clear about things. It isn't about your parents approval/reaction, it's about you and your well being! btw how old are you ? "
"You know what--overall it really was the best thing for me. I was able to get away from the responsibilities of taking care of little ones for a bit. I know that sounds selfish, but in the state of mind I had been in at that time, I probably wasn't being a good mama anyhow. I was able to regroup and reset myself. 

I am dealing with shit now. I still have suicidal thoughts, but I don't act on them now. They are JUST thoughts when I am feeling low. I do self-harm though (cut). :( 

I think hospitalization is a good thing. :)"
"You've had a traumatic experience, and one that you didn't deserve. Anger is justified. Go talk to someone, offload all of this, take up some activity that lets you vent your anger, all of these will help you begin to close the door on an event that you didn't deserve and definitely want to leave very much behind you. Good luck.

(Also the police are bastards to suspects, guilty or not, despite their claimed lack of bias. That's just an unfortunate fact of life, but one you can just hope to avoid crossing paths with again.)"
"I know you’re tired, and I know it’s hard, and frustrating. I also tries over a dozen medications in various combinations, and numerous treatment methods. I’ve been there. But here’s the important thing - “treatment resistant” is not synonymous with “hopeless.” If you get to that point - and honestly I don’t think you’re there yet, many people have to try 6 or more meds to find the right one - it just means that you and your team need to think a little harder about what to do next (and maybe think outside the box). 

If you have been through six therapists, maybe think about why. Did you not click? (And did you have enough of an open mind and give it enough time for that to happen?) Were you unable to get enough appointments? Were you uncomfortable when the work became difficult? While it’s important to have a therapist you can work with, you also get out of therapy what YOU put in - it’s not a passive process - and you have to stick with it. 

I believe you will find what works for you. Keep fighting!"
"Yeah, it's the worst feeling, isn't it? Your brain tells you that you know you trust him, you know he loves you, etc. but you still have all of these emotions that completely go against all that and you can't make them stop. It's a really awful feeling - two sides of you, just as strong as each other, fighting over you while you're stuck in the middle being pulled in two. Take a deep breath and know at least that you're not alone. Remind yourself that your boyfriend will see this out with you because, eventually, this will be a relatively brief period in your life where things were bad before they got better. Everyone has those times one way or another.

Riding it out might be the best option for you. It's good that you have that perspective - having an end in sight, no matter how far away it might seem, is sometimes all you need to get through something.

I do think that speaking to a therapist might help you reconcile all of this conflict you have. It's your call. If not that, then like I said, you can message me any time, and you can post here any time to let others support you as well.

Focus on making small improvements every day. Keep doing things to make things better, even if it's only a tiny bit - eat well, exercise when possible, unload your problems on others who care about you (that includes us!) and try to do positive activities to keep your mind occupied. Giving yourself a break from all of these thoughts might be just what you need to help gather things back into perspective. And don't be too hard on yourself: if this was all triggered by the BC then at least you know it's an external factor, which might help you to worry a little less about it all.

Hope things get better for you and I really do mean it that you can message me any time. Keep us posted if you can!"

"I used to get extremely paranoid (still do a lil bit) every time I smoked weed/hash. Recently I started smoking in pretty small doses at a time, which gives me a less obvious sense of calm, but helps me a lot because I don't worry as much about seeming ""high""/being caught. "
I've dealt with withdrawal symptoms before and I've gone through some of the symptoms you've listed. I know what you mean by brain zaps. But I've also never had them last as long as a month. You might want to try talking to a doctor. Tell him what you're telling us on here.
"Idk honestly I had this problem for a lot of my college career and it came down to me not truly knowing the material. In order to beat the exam anxiety it’s important to know the material inside out and backwards where as a quiz is usually more of a general skill check.

"If you want my advice, I would recommend going to therapy. Even if you have to spend a good chunk out of your money. I suffer from severe PTSD that cripples me to the point where I can barely get out of bed. It's only going to get worse unless you take care of it right now."

"Rather than taking advice online it’s always best to go to a doctor. Propanolol is a beta blocker and probably wouldn’t be recommended to you first as you’re quite young. They’d probably want to do blood tests firsts. Book an appointment, doctors are here to help :)"

i agree!! someone saw my medication at work and they’re like “you don’t need that. you’re young and hormonal. you’re way too young to be on that” i’m almost 20 &amp; this medication has helped me so much more than i could describe. i’m proud of my medication
"what ?? Learn how to set boundaries, it's difficult and uncomfortable, but you get better at it with practice. You don't have to kill yourself because you have abusive relationships, learn how to protect yourself, so you can start over in building new healthy relationships "
"I don't remember the vast majority of my childhood either; I can probably count the number of memories on both hands. But therapy is a godsend. Therapy isn't just about rehashing the old, but about helping you work through the dysfunctional behaviors and struggles of the present, and becoming more skillful and capable in preparation of the future. Look into different types of behavioral therapy. As you work through the stuff of today, you might be surprised about what eventually comes up from your past you thought forgotten."
"I feel impatient and get frustrated. but never like other people could be such an inconvenience to me regardless of the circumstances I guess.  I place myself at a lot lower of a level then that in general.  to even consider such a thing. I naturally feel that I am at a lower level then anyone else .

"Just let her know you're there for her if she needs you,  be a friend,  try to not treat her any differently (i.e. avoiding in fear  of saying the wrong thing etc) you can ask ""are you ok? "" and listen to what she has to say. 

 if you think she's going downhill (allow a day or so for the shock to wear off) then ask if she thinks she should seek therapy.  

I think stick with her,  esp once the shock wears off. Just you being there for her will be important,  or if she has family that you could contact for her. 


Good luck "
"No it's okay. You don't need to. It's true, everyone's labeled with something nowadays. I'm more just frustrated that my friend wants me to label myself, too. She also says I have anxiety disorders and PTSD, or I show signs, and I've never once had anything traumatic, or anything I'd dub as ""traumatic"", happen to me. So no you don't have to it's just that I don't see how my quirks make me autistic but everyone else's quirks just make them different and unique and whatever else.

TLDR No you don't have to I'm just salty haha."
"Nope. You are NOT a bad person at all. I actually cheered in my mind when I read what happened to your ex. She sounds like she could have some type of mental illness (being nice) and is just an abusive bitch (being NOT so nice). Good for you for moving on and doing what you love. I bet she is kicking herself in the ass right now. She had a GOOD thing...and whatever girl you find will be a lucky one indeed. :) Congrats to you and I think you'd better THANK Karma. She's a bitch alright, but she was in your corner that time. ;)"
"That's been exactly my situation. I posted before about finally seeing a therapist. I had a handle on things for a while, but when suicidal thoughts started coming on strongly, I had to talk to someone. It's hard to talk to people you know about it, because friends/family can freak out over it. Saying you have suicidal thoughts is heavy, and friends/family probably don't know how to deal with it. 

I go between being so anxious and worked up to feeling really low, so I get it. That's how I am. Reddit is a good place to vent."
"When a person is neuro atypical (have autism) all of psychiatric meds work but since that person isn't capable of noticing its effects (ADD) they think its not working. The only way youll see if a med is working is making a mood/symtoms/behavior diary.

"Yes sir I do.  Adopted, white, grew up pretty privileged and yet also quite emotionally abused for being weird and ugly. It also turns out my F*ckup's Biography can be explained with the classification of Bipolar Disorder. Too many trainwrecks in my past to care to pretend to be normal.  I am sorry that you struggle. Hopefully you might find the way to be authentic - like being as optimistic as possible without the fluff. Magical thinking can be worse than only seeing the glass half empty. Not to offer unsolicited advice,.. "
"I believe that you are both right and wrong. Yes certain illnesses get most of the attention but this has always been the case. 

Depression and anxiety are probably the most common and hit closest to home for most. Does that mean there shouldn't be more awareness for other illnesses? Off course not. However I believe that this will have a trickle down affect. 

If we can make the general public aware that mental illnesses is real they will have more awareness for all of them. Their knowledge might not be there but at least they will not be as scared as before. 

We have a long way to go that's true. But getting people involved/interested is easier with stuff they can relate to. As harsh as it sounds the awareness for the lesser known illnesses has to wait for the time being."
"She may have gotten her hands on some really bad weed. Weed is fine but the wrong kind (synthetic, laced, etc) can cause temporary or even permanent psychosis, especially in young people. Also depending on her age she could have been suffering from mental illness for a while and just hasn't voiced her symptoms which is common in kids, and, believe it or not, the weed could be making her more paranoid then usual. Weed isn't for everyone and effects everyone different and for people with mental illness it can be very helpful or the exact opposite. 

If she taken to a psychiatrist make sure they know about the drugs. Drug induced psychosis is a common diagnosis and can fade or be permanent (but usually less server over time, medication is also really effective if taken properly)"
"This is my experience as someone with CPTSD. Mindfulness has only made flashback come about and makes things worse.

I tell my therapist all the time how mindfulness has been helpful but to a very limited extent and when I am at my worst mindfulness will just push me to suicide. I can only use it when I am mentally at my best. And if this is a tool I can only use in my best mind, then it's probably not the tool for me at this time.

My therapist encourages me to keep trying though. My psychiatrist actually believes me when I say it makes me worse, or it will make me suicide. She tells me to stop, that it's ok if it doesn't work, and we can always try again later if I want to, that it's not a requirement of any sort, just one of the many tools. Not all tools work for all jobs."
"That's the thing, a form of normality can be reached after any event, it's just a different normal to what came before. You're bound to feel different, and it's just up to you decide whether that's a good different or not. A week apart is good, and just make sure to spend it really picking apart your thoughts and how you feel.

As to how do I know I love her. Being without her is like a part of me being removed, so yeah it is the fact I can't live without her. But that isn't something I've realised in hindsight, that I knew well before all of this. We planned a future together, our views of how life could and should be are the same and so the only future that makes sense is one that we share together. As for bringing me joy, yes. But not in a short term laugh in the moment kind of way. Love is when they can make you smile without doing anything, just her existence or silent presence in the room could make my heart warm. It's a primal pure joy that can't be replicated by anyone or anything else.

I hope this helps. Stay strong."
"A bit yeah. From what I see on social media it seems like it's almost the ""cool"" thing to have some sort of mental illness. And people are self-diagnosing themselves left and right, throwing around depression and anxiety. But I am not sure how much of that romanticism translates into the real world. I feel like what I see in my Twitter feed and in my real life are two completely different things.

I feel conflicted on that quote because I feel like some people will use that as excuse, so to speak, to further wallow in their depression. I really hope that doesn't offend anyone, either. When I was going through a deep depression it was hard for me to let go of it. My sadness was weirdly comforting and in a way, easier for me? I can't quite explain it. This was also why I never wanted to go on medication, and I feel like others can relate to that. But I felt like my anxiety/depression was apart of me and I didn't want that altered. I feel like my depression is always going to be there with me and I just have to do my best to actively reject it. Through the coping mechanisms I have learned throughout the years. But it's always going to be easier for me to just sink back into it. I personally don't find what you said offensive, but to each their own. Different things trigger people."
All love brotha ;-)
Did you ready blog?
Good for you! *hug*
Have a bunch of sex
I appreciate it man
I'll drink to that.
"I'm 43, same thing."
I'm the same way!!!
It is indeed
I’m glad to hear.
No that’s fucked
"Not currently, no. "
"Of course, will do!"
"Rough, I’m sorry."
"Sadly, all the time"
Talk about stupid.
Thank you for this
Thank you im trying
Thank you so much.
Thank you! &lt;3333
Thanks for sharing
Thanks for the tip!
Thanks my good man
This is soooo true.
Top tier response.
What kind of lists?
Where’s the link?
Why am I too harsh?
You are not alone!!
You’re welcome :)
i don’t think so
"im here, whats up? "
thankyou so much :)
yeah will do thanks
"Every mental issue should be understood as a spectrum, the only purpose of the clear cut line is to know what path of treatment should be takin. There are other disorders which lack of empathy occur. But I wouldn’t worry about it unless it’s causing you a lot of distress"
"Go for a walk and shout hit a pillow yell at a tree. It's okay to have bad days they're a part of the process. Find an outlet don't bottle up the feelings. 

I don't know you but I'm proud of you! And you should be proud of yourself aswell! Keep soldiering on you can do it! "
"I tell myself they’re not real, people assume it’s like a horror movie. for me it’s like shadow-like figures moving about, I rarely hear voices it’s only my name they say, but yeh another noise I hear is static in my head which slows me down when I’m being spoke to"
"I wish there was something profound or clever to tell you but there isn’t. You are completely free to feel that way but be aware that if that were factually true everyone would think/ feel exactly the same about you, even strangers. 

I can guarantee that this is not true."
"I've been honest, whit the doctor and my family and I can't get therapy because my family won't pay for it and I got fired recently and I haven't found a job yet so I can't afford it myself Im really starting to get worried because they won't even pay for the doctor anymore "
"It's very, very common for people on medicine for mental issues to want off their meds when they start to feel better. I struggle with it myself. No one wants to be on meds. But you need to get a doctor's advice before stopping them. They can help you taper off if necessary."
"Since you have a record you essentially have to start from the bottom. Apply to a restaurant as a Dishwasher/Kitchen Help. Currently there is a shortage of people willing to do that work. Downside is rent is expensive near those workplaces. 

*Currently work as Kitchen Help."
Sorry- I reread what you wrote and trust and abandonment is the reason why you said you’re depressed. Do you think if you were able to predict the future and the future shows that you wouldn’t be abandon/you found someone to fully trust... would you still feel suicidal?
That does sound like something that would help. If you could recommend a book that you liked that would be helpful. I’m sure there are a lot out there. I wonder if there are any podcasts about it too. I listen to podcasts all day at work so it would be great if there was.
"That is super scary. It honestly sounds as if he’s one step away from hurting you or your family. Please, please be careful! Get a restraining order, do what you have to do to get away from him as quickly as possible. Seriously sounds like the beginning of a horror movie. "
"Hi Sean! I just wanted to let you know you are not alone! My husband also has illness anxiety disorder with somatic symptoms and CBT therapy has been helping him get though it. Like you, he also feels like he constantly has cancer and that something is slowly killing him regardless of his great health. He has pains, sores that support his worry but it is his anxiety alone that creates the somatic symptoms. It is possible anti anxiety therapy and medication could help you cope and perhaps stop feeling pain! Best of luck to you"
"I always have thought different colored eyes was a really cool thing. Just thought I'd say that, I don't know why. I have never thought it made someone look like they had a fake eye :(  
I'm sorry you feel so alone. I feel so alone, too. I am afraid of everyone.

I am sorry I don't know what to tell you to make it better. I am currently in the process of seeking inpatient help myself because my problems are now finally out of control.  All I can tell you is that you are probably judging yourself more harshly than you deserve."
"I don't know an awful lot about ADHD but do you think this could be exacerbating it?  From what I do know about ADHD there can sometimes be problems in regulating emotions, impulsivity, outbursts etc.  It may be worth looking further into it to see whether or not this type of jealousy or anxiety around partners is common in people with ADHD.
Do you have a clinician that you might be able to talk to about it?  They may also be able to point you in the right direction.
No problem though and good luck to you and your girlfriend!"
"I got on meds for my chronic depression and found my niche.  I tried everything before that!  The only thing that helped was improving my mental health and focusing on self-acceptance (I’m not a “good” person, so I stopped trying to fake it ��).  If you’ve never been depressed before you may improve within a few months - if not I’d recommend seeing a psych AND a therapist.

You won’t be stuck!  Things change.  It took me 13 years of experimentation before I found peace, so it may take some creativity and work."
"I'm sorry you're struggling with this. You aren't being dramatic. It sounds like you're depressed. Depression isn't always the same. Feeling hopeless and alone, being less and less proud of yourself and being exhausted from social interaction all sounds like depression. I think seeing a counselor would be really great for you but if that's not an option, journaling is a great way to get everything out. Don't give up on working on yourself. It's really hard and doesnt always work out right away but keep trying. It's worth it. "
"If you are really scared I instead suggest trying to meet them in person.  
I have a friend who isolates himself sometimes and when he does he stops looking at all electronic messages period.  
He doesn't even look who it's from.  


Try and see if you can meet them in person and explain your worries. Don't worry about being overbearing, if he's fine and thinks that, it's something you can easily work through because it came from a good place. If he's not fine, you'll be happy you went there and lend a helping hand, trust me."
"It's good to hear from someone who deals with the same thing. I was diagnosed at a younger age as well. Back then, mine was really constant. I've kind of learned how to deal with it to an extent. Until it goes off the rails. Then I'm kinda screwed. I've tried Marijuana for it and it works sometimes, but others it throws me into a really bad attack. Although, it's probably the strain. I've read that indicas are what you need for anxiety. CBD has been amazing so far. It really helps me and it was a total pleasant surprise tbh. "
"I’ve gone through a handful of major depressive episodes in my life. It comes back. And actually, there’s something more beautiful about coming out of a cloud of apathy and depression and you really do appreciate things more. Colours pop, things are brighter. Practicing mindfulness can help teach you to be in the present moment more, which can help with appreciating the world around you. Also practicing gratitude. Write what your grateful for every night. It sounds small and silly but there’s studies that show it works "
"Nobody should call themselves a POS. We all have potential. People aren't intrinsically PiecesOS. That would be a good name for Microsoft's next operating system, the Piece OS.

Long showers aren't that uncommon, I met a man once who told me he had twenty-minute showers. Maybe he was playing it down and actually had 2-hour showers, I wouldn't be surprised.

Aspirations are one thing, but to have motivation you need a visible direction to take to achieve your goals. It sounds like maybe you don't know what you want from life. "
"Thank you for the response! 

Yes, right now I have no memory of any actual abuse. I would say I had an average amount of imagination. It could be me just putting together different memories, or something I saw on TV. I do know that I did got over to her house, but that particular memory may not actually be my own. It’s just strange to me that I’ve been replaying that same 3 seconds of a memory my entire life and then just recently in the past week or so, I feel like I’ve kind of analyzed it a bit. Thank you, again! :))"
"YES. I have Borderline Personality Disorder. I’d love to stop thinking I extremes, feeling in extremes, stop feeling like everyone is against me. To cope with things easier and to stop feeling constantly abandoned based on the abuse I encountered as a kid. 
 So many people are able to cope but mine stuck with me to the point of destroying relationships and being toxic to people around me. 
 So, yes, if there were a cure for me I’d take it in a heartbeat. I’d love to never have to take medication or go to therapy again. "
"Yes, it bothers me as well. The worse is when people just say it as a greeting but aren't actually asking a question, and you don't realize until after you've already responded and reciprocated the question.. and they just keep walking minding their business like you don't exist. lol. I work retail as well. It's a painful job for the depressed for this reason exactly-- you're expected to be the happy, peppy, smiling face of the company and it really throws people off if you're off.. and the sales stats reflect that. I hate it"
"Antidepressants come with side effects for most people. Fact.

Some of those side effects are serious and some have direct negative effects on mental health (ie sexual dysfunction). Fact.

Getting off antidepressants, once you are on them, is not painless, and can be physically quite uncomfortable. Fact.

Some people find antidepressants helpful. Fact.

Antidepressants are known to have not much therapeutic effect over placebo. Fact.

Placebo does not have any negative side effects. Fact,

Placebo does not have any withdrawl symptoms. Fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey smart move asking the question and not just taking the script.  Strongly suggest being real sure its something you actually want before committing. There are other ways of tackling depression that may be more effective.  "
"I was in a similar situation as you. Hated my job, was getting paid $12.50 an hour meanwhile people I was training were making over $90 grand a year. I had a hard time getting to work by 8 every day and the time went so slowly. Had to start self medicating after work just to deal with the thought of having to go back to work the next day.

This was my first job right out of college about 3 years ago. I quit 2 years in and got a job delivering food while still working for my last employer. After working a month of 60 hour weeks, I put my two weeks in at my last job.

I have more free time now, don't have to bring work home with me, and make more money. The work is repetitive and unrewarding, which can make me feel behind in life, but I'm happier in general. 

I hope this helps."
"It took me nearly a month to cry or feel any kind of sadness after I lost a close family member. I talked to a clinical psychologist about it and he concluded that my experience was completely normal, and that it mirrored a noble aspect of my personality; attempting to remain stable and capable in the face of tragedy so that I could support those around me (family) who were grieving. In retrospect, it wasn't until those around me showed signs of stability and acceptance that I allowed myself to be consumed by the tragedy. It may not be ideal, but I do see the function in this.

With that said, there is nothing wrong with you my friend. You have some wonderful feedback in these comments, and I trust it will not be long before you make it to the better end of this tragedy. Best."
"Thanks, well maybe a really do need help actually I forgot to write this also, but I was a little drunk 2 weeks ago at a family reunion and when I sat with  my family at the table, I had a very very strong feeling like the real world wasn't real in a sense, it was something like day dreaming but much much strong. I made some research on this and it looks like I experienced some kind of depersonalization.
But OMG it was soo unsettling like it ruined the rest of my night and I went straight to bed.
 But after all this research I feel more aware of what is happening to me and when I will have enough money I will surely go to a good psychiatrist to see if he can help me (even though I don't really want to take meds, if he/she believes that I better take some meds I will take them)"
"Why can't you tell me the exact steps that will actually get me a girlfriend? If you know precisely what I have to do to get what I want then what value does me trying to explain what I did that didn't work? It's a waste of time. You'd have to explain yourself anyway.

I never said I was owed anything. You're projecting.

I did take action to help myself. I took a lot of action over a long period of time. Smart action. It didn't work. I think the real reason you want me to explain more is so that you can pick apart some detail and feel superior, like you're helping by giving some vague or general comment. I would write a book, but at the end I'd still not have a girlfriend, so let's cut that part out and get right to you telling me who this woman is who will be my girlfriend. "
"I'm in Philadephia and you'd be hard pressed to find a therapist that will even go as low as $60 for out of pocket, especially given that most of your concerns are very unlikely to cause you any problems.  Each and every single person that goes to therapy and uses insurance gets a mental health diagnosis or else the insurance won't pay.  A lot of folks don't know that but it's the way it works.  


Having a certain diagnosis doesn't impact anything having to do with your health insurance.  It could possibly impact life insurance premiums, but that's a whole other thing.  There is also absolutely no way that your employer could find out that you were receiving mental health services, even if you get your insurance through them.  

I understand your anxiety.  If I didn't work in the field and know all of this, I'd probably have some of the same fears.  Trouble is, if you explained that you had insurance but didn't want to use it for those reasons, most therapists or agencies aren't going to offer you a reduced rate given that most of those fears are either extremely unlikely or impossible to come to fruition.  


For instance, just an FYI, with HIPAA laws, if somehow your insurance company disclosed a mental health diagnosis or information about services they paid for to your employer without your consent, you could sue them for so much money you'd never have to work again.  Given that, you can rest assured barring some HUGE mistake that would cause a lot of people at the insurance company to lose their jobs, that'd never happen.  "
"Thank you so so much, from the bottom of my heart!!! 

And yes, I cover all my own expenses except for rent. I don’t even eat their food (I’m plant based/vegan) so 99% of the time I don’t even eat dinner with them because I usually do my own thing. But I decided that I’m just going to start paying the PG&amp;E bill so they can get off my ass a little more. I do agree with you though.... should I move out, the expenses would be the same exact amount as they are with me living there! That’s how I know it’s all a narc tactic. 

I’m really proud of you for deciding to pursue your dream of getting your PsyD! Seriously, if that’s your passion and what you want in life, don’t let anyone talk you out of it or tell you that you can’t do it! and don’t let your undergrad GPA deter you either! Psychology has ALWAYS been my passion, since I was a teen, but Nmom always told me it was a bad career choice; that psychologists don’t make money; they’re a dime a dozen; they have the highest suicide rate out of the healthcare professions (NOT true btw!).... but you know what? I no longer cared because this is what *I* want to do and no one else’s opinion matters!!!! We just have to keep working our asses off and prove ourselves (and everyone else!) that we are capable and worthy of achieving our dreams!! Great job!!!  ADHD isn’t a joke, and does cause serious hurdles, especially when it comes to academia! I’m glad you got a diagnoses and can properly treat it!!! 

Best of luck to you as well! I’m rooting for you! :)"
"Issues I have with \*some\* of the symptoms/points you mentioned (my personal experience only):

 \- Hypomania - perfectionism, focusing on a small thing and create a bigger thing out of it, equal importance, too many thoughts and different focuses - I am really the best version of efficiency I can ever be. Not mania, completely different.

 \- Anxiety - too much going through my head, many thoughts, ideas and solutions, themes and worries, plans and to-do's... Small details, extreme, almost morbid attention to them - which is so destructive... The compulsive nature of having to work something out and the physical pains and symptoms from it also fit in here;

The issue which fits everything you mentioned (again, in my personal experience):

OCD - all of what you mentioned fits my OCD. While other things have some common points, all those you mentioned act up when OCD hits hard (it's constant but it has its peaks). The 4th bullet point (compulsion, the need to not let it be but do something about it) is especially hard to deal with. And yes, it results in physical symptoms (as does anxiety) - I know the world won't fall apart, I know it'll probably be fine but still I \*can't\* let it stay the way it is, I gotta do something, change it, go for it, act on it. I can only feel a bit more relaxed after acting on whatever it is. I've fought against it for some time but it was making me go crazy and depressed and in my case my compulsions are quite... let's just say they don't mess up with my daily life to the point they are hurting me or damaging my life. If I need to act on them so I can relax a bit after it, I'm OK with it because I can live a so-called ""normal life"" with them (it took some years but now I can). It's really hard to be productive because instead of picking up the pen and write, I'll tear it apart and examine its details... or I'll go learn about pens and search for a better pen or read about the history of pens, make some experiences with various types of papers and various types of pens... it's like a constant rabbit hole you dive into. This resonated a lot with me because it's probably the most destructive (or counter productive) symptom. I used to think it was pure procrastination but it's very different and I can tell those two processes apart by now.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you get the help you need. You can work your life out along with symptoms if you do have the help and you'll find your own strategies and use some of the symptoms as skills to your advantage while managing the ones who serve you nothing.

DBT changed my life
"Google ""misophonia""."
"I cant

I have brain cancer.
No problem at all :)
"No, you're amazing! "
Nope for me as well.
She mightve told him
Shower before bed.
So why kick her off?
Stockholm Syndrome.
That's so stupid...
That’s refreshing.
Then make a change.
Those are wise words
"Very helpful, thanks"
When did this start?
Why would I do that
Why would I do that
Yep. You're welcome.

You really need help
Yup that works too.

what do you mean ya?
what scores you got?
"As a recent college grad, join clubs, set aside an hour to exercise, take a walk if need be, go to counseling (it should be free for students), drink a beer, make time to sleep, and do anything that makes you happy. The key is to stay busy, just not so busy that you fail out."
"But even with people i know for a long time? That do care about me and are my family. Also i dont understand why no one cares about eachother. I would risk my life for random people but i couldnt ever trust them. Idk, i guess im too dumb to even understand how people work :/
"
"Holy crap I feel bad for you. From my experience dealing with mental health professionals, you need to constantly tell them how bad it is. They tend to assume the least and you have to work to make them believe it is worse than that. (At least from my experience) stay strong!"
I barely notice a difference. I have a rare skin condition that makes me look like I have chicken pox and I guarantee it wouldn’t make those go away. I feel like if you’re looking at your own selfies you’ll use filters and all that Jazz so you probably need help anyways
"I browsed an online registry. First I read their bio and saw what I could glean from it. If I was comfortable with that, my final test was looking at their picture and figuring out if I could really see myself looking this person in the eye. 

Ended up with a great therapist."
"I don't watch him, but my daughter says he has been vocal about his own depression and eating disorder. Maybe for those of us who don't want to sit through a whole Shane Dawson video, you could mention the timestamps where the 'stigmatization' of other people with PDs occurs?"
"I don’t know you but even writing about it here is a good first step. Just know that people who have never met you are thinking about you and care about you.

Best wishes! Actually, I’m an astronomy guy and we always sign off with “clear skies!” I like that better. :)"
"I fully understand and agree from a liability perspective. But, we need to find a way to recognize ESAs and the patients who need them. So, What’s been rattling around in my head is, how do we do that? This is a larger question, not one I expect anyone to have answers too. "
"I hate it. The bare truth is unless you know the person, they do not care for any answer. In fact anything other than alright, I'm good etc and they'll soon regret it or worse, think you're weird for actually taking the time to answer. 
I hate society. Can we start a new one?"
"I have felt an extreme need of wanting to just die in the past for being extremely depressed but I know I would be too afraid to do it , but it’s switched recently to just fearing death and getting older. Like I mentioned before , I’m not sure what has been triggering it "
I have this problems so I “continuous cycle” my birth control pills. It’s when you skip the placebo week and move right in to the next pack. This allows you to adjust and the PMS mostly goes away. It is safe and was prescribed to me by my doctor and a lot of women do it
I was going to say could also be food allergies. Wheat and sugar cause me terrible anxiety and I’ve felt a lot better eliminating coffee as well. Just something to think about because I’ve been in that place where everything seems unbearable and you are at your wits end.
"I will always try my hardest to understand if it isn’t something I’m not familiar with. “Normal” issue or not, I am here to help and talk to. Just because you haven’t found somebody who understands you doesn’t mean you never will. Never stop looking (: thank you! "
"I'm struggling at the moment too. I'm fighting really hard but nothing I try seems to invigorate me. As soon as I get home I just crash into exhaustion. It's getting harder and harder to do the basics.

I'll keep fighting but I feel like this is going to have to improve soon."
"Listen dude; you’re okay. We all go through tough times. I know it seems like nothing is okay, but this *will* pass.

Have you talked to your therapist, assuming you have one? I’m sure they can help you with this, I doubt you’re the only one who’s experienced this.

"Literally anything from the author Matt Haig. He has published two excellent self-help/biographical books called Reasons to Stay Alive and Notes on a Nervous Planet, and regularly tweets excellent words of wisdom with regards to mental health. Give him a look, he's inspiring."
"That's a familiar, awful state of mind. Reach out anytime.  The struggle is demanding and tiresome.  I just started offering help on Reddit. Nonetheless, you're not alone by any means. Believe me, this is anything but stupid, it's super easy to downsize your problems, "
"The therapist relationship is a very personal and intimate one if you do not feel a connection like you can trust and confide in this person , ask your parents if you can see someone else. Some people get into therapy for the wrong reasons and that leads to crappy therapists."
"They are making fun of this person for having a mental illness, that's not acceptable behaviour. And as a therapist you probably know that conflict resolution is a very complex social interaction, just because it was easy for you, doesn't mean it can be expected of everyone. "
"What specifically bothers you about these issues?  Channeling my therapist here.

I see some imposter issues, manic depression, some deviant fantasies, some non-conformist tendencies, etc., but what specifically about all this bothers you?  You don't have to live your labels."
"Even “doing it for attention” indicates that he is unwell and needs help. A healthy person doesn’t ask for attention in that way. The act of doing so indicates that something deeper is wrong. (And you minimizing it as attention seeking can be very damaging to your brother.) 

Also, as the above commenter stated, for someone in severe distress, which is probably exacerbated by being in a strange place and feeling out of control, it’s not unusual for a simple statement to take on added meaning or for him to be confused. "
"Get a big canvas, draw a large head, with an oversized, almost caricature like skull. Make the head simple as it won’t be the feature of the piece. Inside that head draw 1, 2, as many things as you like that cause you anguish. If you choose 1 thing, let that thought evolve in your head and draw what comes to mind as that thought grows. If you choose multiple things, draw things that you feel are an obstacle in your life. That way you can look at it and confront those obstacles daily, eventually and hopefully overcoming them."
"I have been DX with MDD and GAD (Depression and Anxiety) and now Pyromania (sigh) along with being a recovering Alcoholic AND Anorexic (not at the same time--my ED went into remission right before my suicide attempts and before my Alcoholism started and I've been sober for 2 years now) so I'm very familiar with depression and anxiety. Ironically enough, my Anxiety kicks off my Pyromania something fierce and my Pyromaniac behaviors therefore calm and ease my Anxiety. It is strange to say the least. I am here for you too. &lt;3 "
"I wonder if it’s possible to have a very mild attack of this condition. I have lifelong and regular insomnia. With that comes many secondary quirks and health problems. Every few months, after an extended period of sleep deprivation, I get this feeling like I’m huge and tiny at once. My limbs feel very wide and I feel tiny all over. Yet, as I lie there in the dark, I feel as though my feet at 10m from my eyes. I don’t think I get all of the time distortion parts, though. Or the thing about materials feeling differently. "
"It's the same for police in the Netherlands. I wasn't saying that they should after 2 appointments. I simply implying that they shouldn't make one because you want to be a police officer. I hope you can understand and respect that. 

Don't worry about it just go for it and see what comes your way. There's no way he could now that so soon. Besides a DSM5 is taken to get a better picture on it. 

I really hope you get it sorted out. I know it's a shame if you can't become a cop it doesn't mean you can't have a good life though! "
"She is on multiple medications and goes to therapy, but she refuses to use any of the tools that her therapist has taught her and she either refuses to take her medication or abuses it to get high. We can't seem to hide anything from her, she always finds it. And yes, she is a teenager, but normal teenagers don't make mistakes like this. We can't keep dealing with her, and the fact that everyone seems to think that I need to be a superhero and rid her of the demons that possess her is incredible to me. I'm a mere man, not God."
"She will probably benefit from hospitalisation at this point. It's hard to get someone with AN to see what is happening and to confront their illness because it serves a purpose in their life. I would express your concern to her and her family and tell her to not loose anymore weight, since she won't want to be in a wheelchair or experience any of the myriad complications of Anorexia Nervosa. You may want to express that she was beautiful before the weight loss and she will be happier and healthier if she starts to seek help. "
"Yes. Well...sorta.  


I was walking recently (I walk every morning once the kids are in school) and all of a sudden, I saw myself lighting the buildings on fire...I saw the flames and they were beautiful. No matter what I looked at, I saw myself lighting it on fire too. I walked my whole ""route"" and all I remember is flames. I snapped to and realized I was already walking back home. I lost almost an hour and I don't remember much about it. I think I might have dissociated or something...maybe that is what happened to you too?"
"Your loved ones just want you to be happy and they worry because they care. Doing what is best for you is also best for them. I used to not want to be on medication and just wanted to do therapy because I wanted to solve this problem on my own but some problems can't be solved naturally. For me personally, I just have screwed up brain chemistry. Anxiety runs in my family and I have had anxiety all my life. Therapy isn't going to rewire my brain. Still, give both a shot and if you don't like meds, you can just go off. Good luck"
"Hey Tyler, first of all, it gets better. I know from experience. I dealt and still an dealing with mental illness, so you can know that I'm telling the truth. The next thing is to be open an honest with the ones you love. I know this can be hard, but it's what helped me. You don't have to come right out and tell everyone everything, but just talking to a close friend might even help. I know this is hard, but it's really what kept me afloat during my worst times. Eventually, when you're ready, I'd ask for help. Therapy can really help, but it's really hard to ask for. However, it's not worth suffering for or putting yourself in danger. People love you, and they would hate it if they knew you were like this. You can pull through this and come out a happy person. I believe in you."
"Im in PA about an hour south from Philly and I’m in college. It’s just making doing everything so difficult and that can’t happen when I have classes and work to do, yknow? I’ve looked into BetterHelp but $60+/month (while more than reasonable) is kinda a lot for an unemployed college student. I just wish that at school they had the counseling center was open longer or had more therapists so that I wouldn’t have to wait what fees like so long. 

I don’t really have friends here and I feel stuck because I don’t have anyone to talk to and nowhere to go other than my room. I don’t feel motivated to get up and make friends, yet I want someone who I can talk to— but with so much going on with me I don’t want to be such an emotional leech to them and put them off."
"I don't think you're a big baby just for that. We all have our rough days and sometimes that can get us emotional, besides, it's super frustrating trying to fix something and making it worse. Not to mention it was a situation completely out of your control and to make matters worse, it was at work, were you have to try to be professional so it's embarrassing and frustrating being forced to talk to your boss about something like that and I think all of that mashed together at once is enough to make anyone emotional. I think you tried your best and you tried to weather it and get through it and tried to communicate through it and I think that isn't at all what a big baby would do. You'd be a big baby for crying and storming out of work the moment you saw the blood. But you're a human being for trying your best and having emotions and honestly a tough one for trying that hard to get through them, even if it didn't work out perfectly in the end.

On a side note, and I may be wrong, but your boss sounds really understanding and kind."
"Not really enough information in your post to get into whether you 'should' or 'shouldnt'. Maybe consider:

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding anyone significant in your life is it could be very unwise to say anything you cant take back. That sort of disclosure can permanently damage relationships and cause serious hurt to others.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, how you feel should not always direct your actions. Sometimes feelings are a very bad indicator of what we should or shouldnt do. Acting based on emotions, rather than carefully thought out logic and reasoning, especially for people with mental health issues, is not always the best way forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes its better to keep ones feelings to oneself, especially if expressing them could be very hurtful, or outright harmful to others.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe if its just about wanting space for awhle that is a different conversation?  - where the discussion is just about wanting time out for yourself, rather than talking about a lack of feeling for others?

&amp;#x200B;

Just saying..."
"Schizophrenic here. The vast majority of my hallucinations are neutral or good but I only go to the doctor or really raise an issue with those around me when they are negative or ‘evil’. 

In general when I am hallucinating, I see things like tiny animals surrounding me, imagining the savannahs of Africa appearing on your coffee table. I see the world as fantastically, Dragons over head or a building subtly transformed from skyscraper to castle tower. I see the trees walk or the shadows contain beasts which might be scary, just they usually are not. 

It isn’t wonderful and the bad times when I fear for my life because I am afraid of the black nightmare who is stalking me through the streets out weight the ‘good’ hence I have medication. 

I had nearly entirely positive or neutral hallucinations for 10 years so went undiagnosed until I had a terrible episode and was nearly sectioned. I had schizophrenia for 10 years or more before that but was only diagnosed on that negative hallucination.
Hope this helps explain this."

"Also just want to add that I'm speaking from experience. I saw the same therapist as my roommate throughout college and it was a mess. My fiance and I saw the same therapist for couple's sessions, and that was good. But even married, we see separate therapists. It's healthier."
"Check your GP.

Sometimes you think it's your mind but it might actually not be.

You have no idea how many times people are taken and treated for depression and shit when all they have is hypothyroidism or another hormonal imbalance of the sorts, or anemia, or shit like that."
Could be social anxiety. It sounds more complex than that though. If you don't mind my asking - what were your parents like? I'm not trying to get all freudian on you - but I do know some people who share some of your behaviors and I'd like to see how your backgrounds relate.
"Don’t just stop taking them. Believe me , it’s not going to be good. It’s best to ween off them slowly like 25 mg down every 2 weeks or something. Ask another doc what they’d recommend, but going cold turkey with any kind of mental health medication is not a good idea "
"Dude it sounds like you need to re-evaluate whether or not she needs to be in your life, what a horrible and selfish thing to tel someone that’s struggling with depression. 

Is there any chance you can save while you look for a better job? Thanks for sharing your story btw "
"For me, its easier to talk to someone close because I have already built that trust, vs with a professional I really dont know them and they cant really say the same comforting things and give advice like a friend can, though they dk have education in everything you talk about"
"I'm glad it was some help to you. After reading some of your posts after I wrote this I saw that you in a very stressful home situation that would honestly test anyone to the limit. 
I'm wondering if you are able to get that across to the mental health services you engage in.
"
Keep doing what you’re doing with the CBD. Also keep being there for her and let her know she can tell you anything. Try to find a therapist/counseor who specializes in children. It might take time to find a good one but it’ll be worth the wait when your children improves.
"Looking at your post history, if any of it is true and not just for trolling, i really do hope you find the help you deserve. As a fellow victim (3x) of sexual assault, it comes across as misplaced anger from how you were raised and the values you were taught from a young age."
Most people with DV clearance are going to have worked under the lower clearances for years. He should be able to have a long and successful career with lower clearances. It’s not worth it to go without medical treatment because then a person will be fired for their actions
"Right there with going from zero to sobbing. For me, sometimes the only thing I can do to halt it more quickly is to try and make my emotions cold. Like, internally angrily cuss myself out. It's weird. :-\ Than when I'm safe at home I can cry it out if needed in healthier way."
Something else that I'm unsure if it's related or not is for some reason I just can't handle being touched anymore. Like someone tried to hug me after it happened and I almost attacked them (but thankfully didn't). Or when I got home my dog tried to lick me and I jumped a mile
"Thanks for your comment and update is that I got fired officially today. Could see that one coming. I don't know how to feel... Disappointed in myself, but also relived because it does seem that I do need some time to focus on myself. 

Good luck to you too, I know it is hard."
The mushrooms might have triggered a serious mental health issue. With therapy and possibly medication you might improve your quality of life but you might be stuck with a lifelong mental health problem now. Go see a doctor or a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis. Best wishes
Then you need to get this sadness out of your system. Cry it out. Cry out all the pain and heartache. It's the only way you'll ever get over your grief. And it's the only way you'll ever be happy. Don't be afraid to talk about your issues. And don't be afraid to be vulnerable.
"True that. And that's a good question, I haven't really thought about it but then again if I did get a steady and stable relationship I dont have any doubts that I would really enjoy it. Guess it's hard for me to compare when I haven't really had a real relationship in my past"
Would going to therapy help you process your emotions better? One of my male friends just recently started coming to terms with his emotions and learning how to express them. It's heartbreaking that boys are taught from a young age that being emotional is a sign of weakness.
"You can use anything to measure your self worth. Just try to pick a metric that increases your quality of life, and not decrease it!

I use helpfulness as my metric. I try to make people's days just slightly better. I've gotten a bunch of thanks, so I feel alright with myself."
"You know what I thought of when I read your title? Squidward singing I HATE PEOPLE in an empty Krusty Krab lol.   


You aren't abnormal for feeling this way. Sometimes I would like to just get on a plane and keep on going forever and ever...we all need an escape sometimes. :)"
"You’re experiencing a dissociative disorder, most likely from past trauma. It’s how your brain dealt with all the bad stuff (like “nope nope nope nope nope”). I have the same mental health issue and found that a treatment called EMDR really helped relieve the symptoms."
"Welcome to the depersonalization club! I joined in May. Glad you could make it. We have cookies and punch by the door.

Pot got me into this mess. I don't even want to think about what you went through. But you opened your mind to a new perspective of existence. It's extremely uncomfortable at first, but with patience and support you can get used to it. I think of it as a burdensome sort of wisdom, but it is the end result of being truly open minded. This is a journey, like all of life.

Anyway. what are these nightmares about?"
"Let me comment just based on my own personal thoughts and experiences over the years. This was a terrible conversation with your mother and she was wrong to treat you that way. 

Mental illness, to me, is a disease like diabetes. Yes, I have depressive episodes. It is chemical and medication helps drastically. 

HOWEVER, when you have diabetes, you need to make drastic changes to your lifestyle if you want to stay healthy. It is the same with mental illness. 

So if I really wanted to win this battle, I need to eat right, go to therapy, read on improvement, sleep well, learn social skills, stay sober, etc. 

All of these things will help me keep my mental illness, diabetes, under control and at bay so I can live a happy and powerful life. 

It’s not easy, but it’s worth it. "
"My partner actually has diabetes and I said if i ever ended up with it that I’d just not take the insulin and die. But I think asking someone with mental health problems and suicidal tendencies is not the person you want to be asking that. 

I just hate relying on meds never have and never want to. I don’t even take paracetamols if I can help it. And not to mention the mental health meds do change you and the way you think where as insulin just replaces something you can produce anymore. (I’m obviously not talking about antidepressants here because I know they replace hormones and chemicals you don’t produce, but I see that as more a chemical problem not a mental health problem. 
Stuff like diazepam and anti psychotics just change the way signals are sent to the brain. )"
"People always develop at different speeds. At 20 i was the same, sitting around depressed without much direction in my life. I had thoughts frequently about how inadequate I thought I was because everyone I knew from high school was making progress and being a success. Fast forward to age 26 and I found direction and worked hard to get there and am now a year out from medical school.

The point is, try not to beat yourself up because you aren't at the same place as someone else at a similar age. Try to focus instead on what small steps you can take towards a success that makes you happy. At 20, you are at a time where finding your place in the world is a timely process. It might take a while, but keep trying to focus on yourself and you will find a solution that makes you happy!"
"Your environment can suck, but you can still take ahold of your own fate and try to engage in behaviors that make you less depressed.

Think of it like the obesity epidemic. It's not like millions people suddenly decided they wanted to be fatter, it's a series of all sorts of environmental effects that caused it to be much easier to overeat.

But knowing that, you can still count calories or cut out soda to try to prevent yourself from gaining weight or even lose weight. The same with depression. You can still take up running or meditation. You can start playing an instrument or pick up one you haven't played in a while. It might be hard and you might not be successful, but everybody has free will and if you remember that, you can exercise your free will, at least in the moment."
"Break the cycle, the comfort zone so to speak, do something you havent done. Focusing on calling yourself useless wont get you anywhere and will probably continue to have adverse effects. Other than that I can't answer your question, nobody is going to give you an infallible answer on how to live your life. Try waking up early and exercising in the morning or something, calisthenics or a run, but push yourself whatever you do. I was unemployed and turned to a seasonal job of lifeguarding, knowing that exercising would help me pass whatever test I needed to and that whatever amount I spent getting the cert would pay for itself once I started working, an investment. The exercise and its application gave me something to feel good about. Whatever you do, commit to it, if you are unhappy with your current situation you gotta do what is within your power to change it, acknowledge what you have no control of but don't forget the things you do control in your life. 
Best of luck and I hope your situation improves, what you focus on grows"
"I'm also 21. I only recently realized that there are some new things that seem interesting to me and I'm currently looking into them. I believe that most young people feel some sort of pressure. We feel like we should have our shit together but the truth is we are still very young, inexperienced, reckless and we still have plenty of time to figure stuff out (technically everyone is always evolving and changing and noone is ever complete). I usually have to force myself to go out (with friends or by myself) and when I finnaly do most of the time it's not so bad so maybe just try to go somewhere nice (like a park or something like that). Even if you are by yourself. Try to focus on everything around you. Forget about yourself. If you like art you can sketch your surroundings- people, nature, buildings- focus on that. Don't think about the person that you think you should be. You are you and everything is simple. There is no need to define who you are. It's easier said than done of course but this simple exercise helped me a lot :) "
"Hey, I’m so glad you reached out. I can imagine you have a lot of feelings right now, and middle school (as we call it in the US!) can be a very difficult time for friendships.

As someone who teaches middle schoolers, and once was a middle schooler with an eating disorder, here is my advice: if you want to reach out to Jess, you should absolutely do so. Friends are precious. Two things though - firstly, you have some information that she doesn’t know you have, and might not be happy that it was shared without her knowledge or permission. Mental health is a touchy subject and she may feel embarrassed or worried about what people will think. It might be better, when you reach out, to just say “I’m sorry we haven’t talked in awhile but I miss you. I noticed you weren’t at school, how are you doing?” and let her share as much or as little as she wants. Second - be prepared for her to not want to talk. She might be feeling rejected, and isolated, by you and her eating disorder. If she doesn’t want to talk, give her the time and space she needs. 

I’m so happy you were able to find yourself and make some new friends - don’t forget to celebrate that and take care of yourself too. You are important. It’s okay for things, and the people, in your life to be changing. "
"I really really recommend you start to see a counselor if it’s feasible for you. If you don’t like the formality of traditional therapy there are therapy apps like Talkspace you can look into. If money is a big factor, there are resources you can utilize (At least if you’re in the US) that are available to the public (typically geared for low-income populations/folks with no insurance). 

My therapist has been helping me reframe how I think about my perceived problems or faults, and the role of my habits in my life. I have a huge issue with rejection/failure and I often procrastinate on things and then beat myself up after the fact. However instead of blaming myself, I’m learning to recognize that I’ve been doing things in a certain way partially out of survival and partially as a way to protect myself. 

For example: If you work as often as you can, you pay your bills. If you are always working, you won’t have time to go out with your friends and do something embarrassing/you won’t be at home alone thinking about how alone you are. If you don’t apply for better jobs, you won’t get turned down. Etc.

Now, I’m not advocating this kind of thinking/behavior but what I’m trying to point out for you is that what you think of as a character flaw may be something you do to protect yourself. Take some time to reflect on your fears/how you deal with those fears or how you avoid them. See what kinds of patterns begin showing themselves and see if they help you shed some light on why you’re feeling so stuck right now. "
"It's not discrimination. While I agree with you that people seldom wish to engage in discussions about the more serious aspects of mental health (We've got all the time in the world for 'Anxiety' but no one wants to talk about suicide) I also think that there's a time and a place, chatting to a fellow employee that you don't know very well (Which I'm presuming is the case since you said you're new) about your mental health is probably in rather poor taste since I doubt the person you spoke to has the training in how to deal with it, cares, or even wants to know.

&amp;#x200B;

I certainly think its fantastic that you want to talk about it and potentially make people aware of how you behave and how to maybe deal with it, but not everyone knows how to deal with such conversations. I know I'd certainly not know how to react if someone I worked with and didn't know very well started talking about their mental health, I'd probably feel like the spotlight had just been shined on me and would look to escape that conversation as quickly as possible. I guess it also depends on the context of the conversation, was it during a break? in that case its none of their business what you're discussing. Was it during working hours? then yeah, they can rightfully ask you to not talk about such things (As I'd expect them to say to anyone talking about other topics also).

&amp;#x200B;

Best bet is to confide in the management directly and make them aware of whatever issues you may be having and allow them to deal with it in a professional capacity. There's no sense in trying to circumvent them and making a problem where their doesn't really need to be one. Every workplace should have someone with the capacity to engage with you about whatever you're feeling and then relay that back to the wider staff. "
"Awesome!

&amp;#x200B;"
"DID here, and yeah :(
"
"Definitely, thank you "
Firebug. Literally. :(
How did you get PTSD?
Hug from me too x ♡
I do not know. Sorry.
"I'd say my mum, yeah. "
Kinda an overreaction
Lol nah I'm good. Haha
Much love from Texas!
Never said anyone did
"Nope, not too frequent"
Parents or caregivers!
"Sure, I’ll be here. "
Thank you so much.
Thanks for the advice
"That's disgusting, US?"
That's terrible
Too tight! Let him go!
Unfortunately yes.  :(
Why do you think that?
Why do you think that?
Why do you think that?
Why is it a conundrum?
Yep! Absolutely true.
You're very welcome :)
"You’re a wizard, OP."
im about to do this ty
some day you will die.
"will tell her ,thanks."
"And above all...in a mental health forum? I'm not going to say I couldn't word things less intensely but...really?

""Hey, check out this sub about mental health! Lets be an asshole to someone setting aside their pride and self image out of concern for the well being of others!"""
"First of all, im so proud of you for this. Being able to name and accept your experience of depression is the first step to managing it. Therapy and medicine has saved my life, so i would simply recommend therapy to begin with. You dont have to have ""a reason"" to be depressed. "
"Hi! I was supposed to start my second year of college today but couldn't go in due to panic attacks and high anxiety, the end of last year was a struggle, haven't been able to go in because of physical and mental health, I'm in the same boat and even contemplating dropping out "
"I doubt it would come to arson since I have enough sense and control to avoid that pitfall. I've already been diagnosed with pyromania which is a difficult thing to live with sometimes. I am on a waiting list for a therapist, so I have nothing else i can do except post here. :("
"I kinda had a heartbreak a couple of years ago, I got over it quite quickly but I think that's what sort of started the whole thing, it's hard to tell, I don't really remember a time when I actually was happy, or would feel these things, I just remember the feelings themselves."
"I know it's the boring but simple answer which is unfortunately very easy and simultaneously difficult to control: sleep, diet, and exercise. Nothing is will make you feel better with more certainty. Also cutting out the booze and drugs if you need to get back to your baseline."
"I'll guess you need someone to trust in full. Ask yourself do you feel safe in the situation around you. You can try to get a dog,preferably a big one to keep you feel safe. Let he to be your emotional support. You can even sleep with him! Also, try to adopt one when you at it!"
"I've been 5150d. Once the nurse decides to hold you, you are in an involuntary hold. They hold you for 72 hours. Then if your psychiatrist says you can go, you are free. If not, they can keep you longer. 

If you are admitted, it's not too bad. If anything it's boring as hell. "
"If anyone thinks that they don’t respect or deserve your time. My thoughts: you’re diagnosed = you’re trying to understand so you can overcome. The people who care and are meant to be in your life will be. 

Sending you positive, healing, and strength vibes! ���� "
"It could be that you're not on the *right* med. If it's within the first 2-6 weeks of being on it, it could be your body adjusting. If it's been longer than that then it's likely a side effect, I had issues with meds turning me into various levels of zombie. Good luck, friend. "
"It's the CBD in the weed that helps with anxiety, paranoia and depression. If going the weed (flower) route, Indica would be more beneficial than a Sativa or Hybrid. CBD drops/oils are great if you don't like to smoke it. It helps but not so much that meds aren't still needed. "
Its chemicals lying to your brain. Hurting your emotions an physical pain also. On days like this remind yourslef that your smarter or stronger then those chemicals. I know its hard fighting the same war with yourslef day in an day out but your worth it. Pm me if u needa chat.
Oh trust me I know. I've dealt with mental health issues since I was a teenager. It's crippled me to the point where I rarely ever leave the house. Society puts a stigma on mental illnesses. And that's one of the reasons why people are afraid to get help. Trust me I understand.
Please make sure you're taking magnesium with your ADHD meds because they deplete your magnesium levels which contribute to worse and worse sleep. I take my magnesium at night it is both a muscle relaxer and calming on the nervous system and it helps me sleep deeper and longer.
"Question, would you rather someone come here and seek help so they don't commit a crime or go out fuck a child and go to prison for a few years? I'd rather protect the child and offer help to prevent abuse than lock someone up because when they asked for help they were ignored."
Rip. She was the only one I was comfortable telling things. Then it got put off for awhile because I went to see a psychiatrist. Then I scheduled again and she was sick then they told me to come in the next week same day and I did and no one was there and now I get this letter.
Thanks. Unfortunately at my age...curing isn't possible (or will take much more time than a therapist would want to spend) so it's just a matter of controlling it enough so I'm not a danger. It's not so bad once you accept it. Fire is lovely...beautiful even. I love it so much.
"When the time is right, he will reach out and tell you what's going on for him. You just have to be patient. Hopefully after working through his dissociation, he will become a better version of the man you love. 

Stay strong, sis. Your family will (hopefully) be whole again xx"
"I did okay in high school; was always really quiet and kept to myself. I always drew during class; I found it helped me focus during lectures. I never really studied much; would get 60-75% in most classes and a few 80-95% in the ones I enjoyed. I never had trouble understanding lectures; it is only in a conversational setting that I have trouble processing information. I don't think it's anxiety or a memory issue, because I remember what I've been told and don't feel stressed about the conversation. I just suck at understanding."
"LOL that's what I always tell people around here.

They go to psychiatrist first thinking that the problem is in their heads and because most of psychiatry is not really based on science, they don't really follow a methodology; they just try and attempt to relieve the symptoms, but it's like giving ibuprofen to fix an open wound.

Everyone who might think that they have mental issues must and should go to their general practitioner first, most of the times the problem is not in your head; a psychiatrist, it's your last resource."
"Do you see a regular doctor / primary care? A regular doctor can can get you started on some medication and they can give you resources to therapy that is free or low cost. 

If your parents are taking care of your medical stuff, ask them to make you an appointment to get a check up. If you have insurance, the doctors office will receive that information from whoever makes the appointment for you.

When you speak to the doctor, at first you might want to leave out the word ""suicidal"" since that is very alarming and could get you put in the hospital, rather it's better to say that you feel hopeless, to get the point across. 

Talking to people on the internet is fine but I think you know it's come to a point where you need to speak to an actual professional. Wish you all the best."
"Glad to hear you are in therapy and I hope it's a good fit with that particular therapist. Have you discussed or he/she brought up cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)? 

I have severe chronic depression and general anxiety it started when I was 12 and am now 34, and I went through a book called mind over mood which is a CBT book that teaches and is also a workbook to practice what is being taught. It helped me with coping. I also find Headspace for mindfulness to be helpful. The first 10 days are free then you have to pay to access the full app but I just keep repeating the 10 days as they help out just fine. 

What about seeing a Dr for medication? Maybe some anti-depressants whether short term or long term would be helpful and help you get through what you're going through now. "
"I think I figured it out, thanks to this thread. One of the videos someone linked to earlier talking about Dysthymia, or high functioning depression.  I’ve basically never related to something that well in my whole life. Everything the woman said about the disease, I could relate to it. I’m getting back out of the slump that I started this day in and I’m feeling a little better. I’m not sure when I’ll be pushed back into the slump but when I am, I’ll come back to this thread and talk to you all some more. At the moment I’m feeling good, my appetite is back, so I’m sitting in bed with a bag of slightly burnt popcorn and The Office on. I’m feeling good for now. Thank you all so much, for being so warm and caring and smarter than I am. It’s really helped me out. "
"My thoughts to you. It must be a horrible situation you're in and i cant even pretend to understand how you feel.

You're right, that your son needs to find the need to get better himself for any kind of therapy to work, but this is a hard thing to convince someone who is hurt and frighened. 

Stay by his side and keep yourself and him as stable as can be. I hope you will find something that helps you.

I'm not sure if it is a good advise, but finding something that distracted my mind and gave me selfesteem back was my way of dealing with depression back then. I started a hobby i enjoyed and got good enough in to feel pride.
I started building upon it and gained friends by communicating in those thematic circles.
I dont know if it is something that could help in your situation.

"
"Talk back to it. If you say, ""I hate myself!"" Immediately put your hand on your chest and follow with something like, ""No, I love myself. I am kind and I'm trying my best."" Or when that voice starts getting loud, instead of saying you hate yourself out loud, try telling that hateful voice to shut the hell up. You've got plenty  of great qualities, you just have to give them the room and a voice.

Also something weird that I found helpful was to keep a picture of my 4 year old self around. I wouldn't tell a child I hate them. I wouldn't tell the girl in that picture that she's a bad person or that it's all her fault and she's garbage. It honestly helped me develop some self compassion and to quit verbally abusing myself.

Hope you find something that works for you. Keep fighting. "
"Yeah I can relate. My mental health issues have crippled me for the past few years. If anything I'm probably closer to low functioning than I am high functioning. 

I go to a psychiatrist. I actually have an appointment next week. It's a new doctor though this time. I'm afraid because I just assume that everybody just wants to hurt me.

I don't have any friends. I've been alone for years. I've got a couple family members I live with whom I've talked to about my issues but it's just not the same.

I've been reaching out to a lot of people on this site over the past week or so. People who are struggling and people who are suffering. I've been trying to help them and offer advice. Mental health isn't a joke. It can be crippling and exhausting. And I wish more people understood that."

If you're in the US, you can make an appt directly with a psychiatrist, doctor, or therapist. Most psychiatrists will require that you're in therapy along with taking medication, as this is the most effective.

I've taken beta blockers to help my anxiety, but also found other medications that work well. You likely won't find the right fit on your first try. It's a process. Others have said to see a doctor *and* a psychiatrist, and that's always a good idea. Things like thyroid disorders and hormone imbalances can cause anxiety so you'll want to rule any physical cause out. 

If you use your mom's insurance, she will get an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) in the mail 2-4 weeks after your visit. It will only list that you went to the doctor and used the insurance but will not give details of the appointment. If the doctor prescribes you meds and you don't want to share that with your family, you can use a discount site like [GoodRx.com](https://GoodRx.com) to afford them without using your insurance (and be sure to ask your doctor for generic).

Keep in mind that meds are a good way to put out the fire or take the edge off, but they don't fix you. They work best in combination with regular therapy. In many cases the right therapy on its own can be just as effective as medication.

Even if your parents laugh, I'd still talk to them. Let them know you're serious. It will make going to appointments less stressful because you won't feel like you have to hide it. There's no shame in going."

A general practitioner?
Alright well good luck.
And what should I say?
Basket Case - Green Day
Big time out of line!!
Check out cptsd maybe?
Check out the app notok
Do you have borderline?
Gotta seize them means.
Has never worked for me
"Hello, and welcome. :) "
I cried. It's beatiful.
I talk funny sometimes.
It’s called Pure OCD
Lol it’s the worst eh
"Lol thanks, you too! (:"
Mine is “pretty ok”
"No, this isn't allowed."
This was amazing
"Uhh, alright, will try."
Urges to do what mate?
What state are you in?
What was the diagnosis?
Why do you want a gun?!
You are so welcome. :)

what are you afraid of?
"*coydog gives a friendly lick of solidarity to your hand, runs off* Some days are rougher than others even though things can often be rough in general, hope you have less rough days and more really awesome days. There's often beauty in the sky and most don't look up very often. "
"Do yourself a huge favor and take ten seconds to look at how you treat the people you care about,  then own the fact that you can do better and start putting one foot in front of the other towards some personal growth instead of drowning in some imaginary victimhood and denial. "
"Get your own place.

See what, if any, scholarships are available and apply to as many as you can. That’ll give you some cushion in your budget. You may also have to take out some student loans, however millions of Americans do this and it’ll bring you closer to your dream. "
"I used to have a problem with enlarged lymph nodes. I was convinced that I had some type of lymphoma. It turned out to be nothing and the swelling went down on its own, but damn was I ready to just shave my head because I knew the chemo was going to make my hair fall out anyway."
"I was on it for a short period of time. It made me extra sleepy. I already have trouble staying awake (think I might have narcolepsy to a certain extent) and wellbutrin made it worse, like my mind was in a constant fog. I'd talk to the doctor and get switched to something else. "
"I wish I could take time out, more than anything. I just want to go back to work and try some new areas without this giant commitment of school that has taken over my life. But I can't do a time out, in this program you're either in it or you're out. I really wish I could pause."
"I've been on Prozac for a couple of months now. Before I started I'd have these unrealistic and trippy dreams, but now with the meds I only dream about my everyday life, sometimes I get multiple false awakenings in a loop, and it makes it hard to distinguish reality from dreams."
Never said depressants/anti depressants were related -_- marijuana is classified as a stimulant or a depressant depending on a strain. Marijuana hallucinations are rare. Natural and synthetic drugs are nowhere near the same. Please do more research you sound completely ignorant.
"Thank you so much! I'm also glad that you're attempts were unsuccessful, I think it's really nice that we can talk about our issues and thank you for your concern but these days I am doing really well and I hope you are too and I am sending hugs and love all the way from the UK "
"There’s no ‘should’ with your illness. There’s no way to put a manic episode somewhere else so it will be more convenient. You can’t turn one off or turn one on at your pleasure. Which sucks, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not something you can think your way out of."
"Update: I expressed to him that I was tired of all of this, and he kept saying that he was a horrible father and he wishes that someone would kill him in the line of duty so I could “go live with my mom and be happy”. I’m so hurt and I’m so tired of this. I want to die. "
"Well, i knew it was going to happen. I think they chose a natural end to therapy and it coincided with her leaving, anyway.  Its just hard because i dont feel ready yet.

I really have. I know more about myself than I thought i could ever learn now. I'm just not fully okay, yet."
"Hi there :)

Please don't be afraid of medication, and of admitting to those close to you how you feel. The people who love you want you to be happy.

As far as medication goes, think of it as an aid, just like you might use a crutch if you'd badly sprained your ankle. It's there to aid that natural resolution. It may well be that when you find the right one, you only need it for a certain period of time, until things calm down enough to allow you to manage again, just as before.

I hope you start to feel better and recover soon."
"I cannot express the amount of gratitude I have for the redditors that took time to give me resources outside of Reddit to help those in the community I'm reaching out to. I cannot begin to express how proud and strong those people are that reached out to me. Thank you so much for sharing! 

I'll be here, msg me if you need to talk. If it's an emergency, please understand I can only help up until a point. I can guide, alleviate, but I can't fix. I love all of the people who had the guts to open up

✌️❤️������

"It's something that sounds more intimidating than it is. But a good way to start is just by doing deep breathing exercises. You can breathe in for 3 seconds, hold for about 1 second, then slowly breathe out for 6 seconds. And repeat. Your mind and body will naturally calm itself down, allowing you to think clearer about things that are bothering you.

But there's so many different types of meditation, that if that doesn't work for you, you can try other things. You can even make up your own ideas once you get comfortable with it."
"Oh yeah, that’s exactly what happens. You kinda reach a burn out state, you’ll get stressed and anxious but you tend to feel very apathetic about life in general. 

Prolonged anxiety also tends to be linked to depression, which is commonly seen exactly as that: a consistent state of apathy. 

I myself experienced this very intensely through my last two years in university. It took a lot of mental training to get out of it: mindfulness was essential, as well as learning not to take on more work then one can comfortably handle "
"The best thing to do is to just assure her that you have her back no matter what. You don't have to pretend to believe her, but you should try to assure her that nothing bad will happen to her and that no one can hurt her. If she doesn't want to use her phone or go to school don't try to make her or anything like that. If she wants to go alone to the doctor or have you or your parents go in with her go along with it. She might need support or might be afraid of one of you. The important thing is that she knows you're on her side."
"What a jerk thing to do. You could start putting posters up of firemen and stuff and making comments to the TV yourself or hang out with other men more, but I wouldn't stoop to that level of disrespect to make the point. I would just make it clear that you could do that and for him to stop now to save your marriage. Make it clear that this is a huge warning sign in your marriage that says WRONG WAY, DO NOT ENTER. If your words don't sink in, maybe do something obvious and symbolic to get his attention, but don't be disrespectful."
"Yeah, you don't know that. It's been the prevailing idea for some time now, but it's not really understood. What would the ""correct"" chemical balance look like? There are no doubt chemicals that influence mood in the brain, and meds that impact the production or uptake of those chemicals, but if your first statement was true, antidepressants would cure depression. They frequently do not. Some people find them helpful, some do not. The human brain is much too complex and complicated for anyone to make blanket statements like that."
"You’re not abnormal at all. I’m sorry you went through all of that. The fact that you can put into words why you’re feeling how your feeling makes you seem “normal” to me. If that makes any sense. 

Why do you think it’s getting worse? Is it because you’re afraid of being left? Or that you won’t ever fully be able to trust?

Sorry for asking so many questions. 

There are days when I can’t pin point what I’m feeling but I just wished I didn’t exist anymore. I’ve been feeling this way for the past 4 years. "
"Do you have any trauma that revolves around getting your picture taken? (Example: my sister as a baby HATED getting her pictures taken because my grandpa always took her picture with flash on and she developed a fear of flashes because it scared her) Do you think something is going to grab you/take your soul if someone takes your picture? Or that someone is after you if they take your picture? If so, you should definitely try talking to a therapist about this and see what they say. In general I don’t think there’s nothing wrong with not wanting your picture taken and those that know you should respect your wishes of not wanting any pictures. But either way, if this is an issue that you want fixed then you should talk to a doctor/therapist about it.


Hope this helps :)��

"I guess it comes down to what you want to learn,  and what will help get you some stability on your fears. The internet is a great place to spiral around heaps of subjects.  YouTube has endless content. Find something you like, and see if there are book on the subject (there will be) i find books great, because you HAVE to pay attention to get the information, while you can drift with videos.a few good one to start are ""A brief history of time"" &amp; ""Grand Design""  Stephen Hawking, ""the future of humanity"" - Michio Kaku. Heavy reading, but informative. And a few topics I find interesting are earths radio bubble, and quazars. Whichever way you approach this, just remember its a journey, not a destination. Dont forget to keep yourself centered, don't forget about your hobbies etc. "
"I want to point out /r/bipolar and /r/BipolarReddit . Both are great, but they have different feels.

My experiences have been good with meds. I was first diagnosed with depression, so that med didn't help much, but subsequently I've been pretty well managed. One med had a bad (very rare) side effect but other than that, it's been good.

My parents just learned, most of my friends know. Friends were fine, most of them are pretty accepting though, in general. Parents only found out because my mom picked my medication up for me. It was a bit of a rough convo, but ended up ok.

My work performance got better once I got stabilized on meds, definitely.

I've never had therapy specifically for the bipolar, as I have other issues that are more pressing and not able to be managed by meds."
"I would definitely try a different therapist, I found a great one after a couple tries and it makes such a difference. Also I keep a journal and can go back to specific events with her which is hugely helpful to reframe events I had seen as catastrophic. 

Medication has been helpful to me so I would recommend it but meds come with side effects so be wary. I’ve gone through 3 different anti-depressants and they all made me feel worse but I’ve had luck with a mood stabilizer and anti-anxiety. 

BUT I would seriously look at possibilities besides mental illness if this is really sudden with no trigger. It’s possible to have symptoms of mental illness manifest from thyroid issues, gastrointestinal issues (like antibiotics ruining your microbiome), and a number of other issues. "
"It's very specific to myself but my mother had a pretty terrible life. She dropped out of school in 8th grade to take care of her parents who were sick and died pretty shortly afterward. She spent her life going from one alcoholic man to another being emotionally and sometimes physically abused. She stayed by my father's bedside as he died, alone because I was only 18 and couldn't handle it. Once I went to college she lived by herself and barely made it from disability check to check. She eventually passed away last year from complications due to COPD and bladder cancer.

She kept going. No matter how bad it got, she kept going. She contained a strength that I only got tangentially, if at all. But when I have thoughts of ending it, I think of how disappointed and sad she would be."
"In my understanding, BPD is commonly misdiagnosed as Bipolar. However it is certainly possible to have both, under the section ""Differential Diagnosis"" of borderline personality disorder in the DSM V: ""Borderline personality disorder often co-occurs with depressive or bipolar disorders..."" I believe the important thing for differentiating between the two is having a distinct manic or hypomanic episode in Bipolar disorder. This means an episode that lasts at least 4 consecutive days. During this episode there is increased activity and energy. And a mood that is elevated, expansive, or irritable. But there are also distinct periods last for just as long or longer where the person with the disorder is depressed or has baseline functioning. Borderline does not normally last this long. It is generally a quick change of mood and emotions. Hope that helps some, I don't have either but have worked in the mental health field for some time. Of course there is more to differentiate the two than this but I think this might clear it up enough. "
"What bothers me is that when I hit a moment where I think with some clarity I see that I have no friends, a crumbling relationship, a job I hate, a huge pack of lies I've fed everyone and now need to live by, material possessions that I don't care for and years of my life washed away. I suppose It's like a self fulfilling prophecy, I get angry that all this happens so I endeavour to make it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I get bitter that I know if I was some preppy female teen with ""issues"" then I'd be getting showered with offers of help or shoulders to cry on. I hold great resentment that because what I feel isn't some warm snugly version of ""Depression"" that people just avoid me. I've literally been banned from mental health websites because users got uncomfortable or deemed what I felt as ""Problematic"". The only time I saw a Therapist she decided not to see me anymore because she found what I said offensive, so I've just spent years boiling over these issues and almost allowing everything to get worse, both willingly and unwillingly.  "
Absolutely shit advice.
"Go get a fucking job...
"
Ha e you tried cymbalta?
"Hey, you’re beautiful "
I care about both of you
I didn't say it... buuut
I think he’s trolling
Join a therapeutic group
Just PM'd you now
Just... *Awful* advice.
Let me guess its the NSA
My messages are open :)
"MyDoor, how old are you?"
"No problem, stay strong "
OK...10x for the input!
Read before I go to bed
So... am I going crazy??
Stay with him all night
Thank you for the advice
Thank you for the advice
"Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;"
"Thanks, this is helpful."
Thanks.  Good luck too.
That ought to stop him.
That's not what I asked.
Virtual hug to you��
Yeah I'm 18 and he's 27
You're so welcome. &lt;3
pm? and...everything lol
yeah it can suck a fuck.
6/12 meh thats not too bad. on that schedule as long as you have a weekend then you should be fine. its the 7-10 days at a time on that schedule that will lead to burnout. that said learn to meditate; that way even if you cannot actually sleep then you can get some form of rest.
"A common response here in blighty is 'can't complain' then if they enquire further just be honest... I'm sure it acceptable to tell someone who asks if you're having a shitty day. I couldn't work in a customer facing environment tho, too many stupid people to deal with!!! �� "
Do you know if the therapists he’s seen have specialized in trauma therapy? There are very effective interventions for PTSD available that are evidence-based. One I can think of off the top of my head is EMDR. It’s important that he’s doing a little more than talk therapy.
"Given the size of our community (and my ethical role in drag) it's gonna be more awkward than not to pretend I don't see him. 

Also, in our community, therapy is normalized and I don't know anyone who isn't in therapy or hasn't been in therapy. So I am not worried about stigma. "
I have a system I use in addition to over the counter stress pills. I put my mind in a good place but I don't force it to stay there. I let it wander off and do what it wants and if it thinks about something that gives me anxiety I start the process over again. I hope this helps.
"I have called my friends before to make sure they were in the therapists it doctor's office. Friends have literally escorted me to a therapist before. 

I know it's hard to tell people about this out if fear of judgment, but if you have anyone maybe that would be helpful for you?"
"I watched some of them. Dysthymia. I fit all the criteria perfectly. Honestly it made my heart race a little with how spot on it was, and my head didn’t necessarily get clearer but it made more sense to have the things I feel put into functioning words and sentences. Thank you "
"If something changes for the worst, or something becomes pretty unbearable, please go to the hospital. You are the only one who can tell if you need that kind of immediate help or not. Please don't stress too much about being a burden. If you need help, get help. You're worth it."
"My anxiety makes it so much worse,i over think everything and it panics me,so then i try to prove to myself that im not crazy which then makes it worse. Its a vicious cycle. Iv just started getting help and start CBT and counselling soon,im hoping to feel saner in the near future"
"Thank you. Tell them exactly that, please. Be explicit so they know what's at stake. Just like you have been with us.

And please keep us posted.

Even if you don't care about anything right now, there are people who care about you and want you to at least try every option first."
Thanks man. I’m scheduled to work tomorrow (Well- today it’s 1:36am) and I know I’m gonna be up all night worrying about the phone call I’m going to have to make to lie about a sickness that I don’t have because I’m too depressed to function. I appreciate your reply.
"There are some fun ways to lose weight...check out the DietBet app. Players sign up to lose a certain % in a certain amount of time (4% in a month, or 10% in 6 months for example), and pay a fee. Those that meet the goal split the pot including the money from those that don’t. "
"Well and if your brother struggles with anxiety, Ativan only exacerbates that. It is pretty habit forming and works by essentially suppressing brain activity. Once it wears off, your brain fights back and many people experience rebound anxiety which then causes them to take more."
"When I get my 600mg of prozac every month, I think about swallowing the entire bottle, but then I read about prozac overdose stories online, and I get scared I won't die. For every method I think of, I always start to worry I'll fuck up. I just don't want to suffer for nothing..."
"Yeah...that was a really bad time. My life is so much different now. I finally kicked alcohol for good 2 years ago yesterday (I just celebrated my soberversary) and we have a house, a family, and are doing ok. :) There are a lot of positives here! What are some of your positives?"
Yes I am seeing a phychiatrist but I’ve stopped going to both because I was supposed to go today but they really haven’t helped and I just didn’t enjoy talking to them as much as talking with my parents so I stopped. My dad is really against medication so I can’t take it.
"You are not your diagnosis. You are not what's happened to you. Counting breaths, 4 in, 4 out, is a good way to physically calm your body so your mind can think straight a little better. Keep going to therapy and work towards healthier behaviors and attitudes, not ""normal"" ones. "
"i tend to have a habit of when shit happens i fall asleep the whole day and wake up at like 1am, i’m turning into an owl,
but my friends get pissed off at me because i don’t see them anymore i have kinda isolated myself from them. 
i can’t tell whether that’s good or bad "
"probably because he didn't get diagnosed early enough. i self-medicated with alcohol but my schizophrenia isn't that bad so I was able to maintain my grades. I had a few breakdowns after college though, but I wish I got diangosed sooner so i didn't waste all that money on alchol."
"Anxiety and depression usually go hand in hand. Anxiety for me is needing a smoke every 50 mins and depression for me is not extending out of my comfort zone by connecting with people or achieving notable success.

Lethargy would be not having the energy to do things.

Depression can be when you're feeling blue or down.

Feeling the need to be with people all the time could be a sense of insecurity.

And your best friend should always be yourself.

Understand that friends come and go.

Focus on you. What would make YOU happy? :)

"
"Depends on far too many factors for anyone here to make an educated guess.  Different doctors will charge different rates for different services, and occasionally for the same services.  Some doctors will offer ""sliding scale"" payments and some won't.  You may qualify for Medicare, Medicaid, or some other cost-reduction programs depending on where you live, your income level, and other factors.  

I get that ""it depends"" isn't an easy or actionable answer, but at this point it's the only answer anyone here can give.  Good luck, OP"
"I just turned 28 now, so I've been doing these things for over half my life. You seem like you understand the spiritual aspect of it."" What if I had just prayed one more time about it and God might have worked."" I feel like often times he is only waiting on us. But I don't know how to stop. I feel like no matter what, from reading these comments I will seek help at the very least to try and learn tools to stop myself. I would just feel better if my husband was on board, maybe he will be. You never know! Thanks for the kind words! "
"I'm very sorry the asshole below is the only one who's responded so far, OP.  Medication sucks in general, and medication with side effects sucks even worse.  Do you have an appointment set up with the doctor who prescribed those meds?  If so, it's probably a good idea to mention them and see about changing the dose or the meds overall.  If not, as inconvenient as it is to make one and as scummy as it can feel (speaking from my own experience) to bum a ride to an appointment, it might be a good idea to make one.

Best of luck, OP."
"Xallyx, was your bipolar diagnosis made by a psychiatrist or psychologist?  Are your mood changes triggered in seconds by events (e.g., some minor comment or action) or, rather, do they usually develop slowly due to changes in body chemistry?  

I ask because it is not uncommon for bipolar to be confused with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  Moreover, even when bipolar is diagnosed correctly, a bipolar-1 patient still has a 50% chance of also having co-occurring BPD.  A bipolar-2 patient has a 40% chance of also having BPD."
"Yes there is. You have gone without for a year or more. I have been sober for 2 years now. It is the best feeling that I've had. I am free from that hell. No more hangovers and being desperately sick all the time...no more scraping for pennies to buy my next bottle. My weight has gone down and my pre-diabetes has disappeared.   


You can do this. Don't drink tonight. Just tell yourself, I can always drink tomorrow. Then tomorrow, tell yourself the same thing. That is exactly how I got through my first year of sobriety. Good luck!"
"You immediately jumped from ""why are you in school?"" to ""having or wanting money makes you depressed,"" and you have repeatedly stated that you view being depressed (and you seem to define ""being depressed"" as everything from ""having clinical depression"" to ""being a happy and successful journalist who writes about local craft breweries"") as equivalent to ""hating God.""

So yeah, you make some buck-wild, ill-founded, bone-ignorant, and frankly hateful assumptions here and everywhere else unlucky enough to draw your attention, sporto."
"I have.
Not wanting to live, but not wanting to die, right?
Just total boredom, just being ""there"".

Never turn to drugs to fill that void or boredom, drugs are never the problem they're the solution and the problem is always deeper.

Sadly I didn't knew this and got into drugs to kill boredom.

Weed was the worse of them all, eventually I learned that positivity is the key, and the same way you say ""I know it sounds super edgy"" Well I know this sounds super cheesy but it is very important to be positive, negative thoughts gets in the subconscious and the sub only spews back at you negativity after and its a never ending loop.

"Some people’s “love language” is gift-giving. It’s possible that she just genuinely wants to make you happy, and says the things she does because she wants validation that it does indeed make you happy. However, since you are uncomfortable with it, if you don’t want it to continue then you need to say something to her. It could be something like, “let’s each do a homemade gift for birthdays this year” or deciding on a spending limit. Or even deciding not to exchange gifts at all. It will be uncomfortable to bring up, but nothing will change if you don’t. 

I do not think she is being manipulative, though. I don’t know her, so I don’t know for sure, but it sounds like she genuinely just wants to make you happy, but is a little awkward in how she goes about it. "
"Congrats on taking the leap.  Don't put too much pressure on yourself.  Talk as much or as little as you feel comfortable about your issues in the first session but at the very least make sure you talk about yourself.  Let the therapist get to know you and don't be afraid to ask them questions.  


Good therapy isn't going to be a quick fix and it's not going to be easy.  It will be a lot of hard work and may push you out of your comfort zone.  Make sure that you feel comfortable and safe with the person guiding you on the journey before diving in too deep.


As some others said, don't expect to be ""cured"" or feel completely better after 1 or just a few sessions.  What you should at least have by session 3-4 is some level of comfort with your therapist and some idea of what direction the work is going and feel confident that it's the right direction.  If you don't have that, consider trying a different therapist as you may be able to find a better fit.  Hope this one is a good fit for you though!  Best of luck!      


Best of luck!"
"I know I had a very stressful experience as a kid once. Not physically but mentally/emotionally bullied.

Got teased because I spoke english and not our native language in our class by this one kid. I was a crier and didn't know how to cope with something like that. Ended up having thoughts of self harm/suicidal stuff. Thankfully I didn't know how to kill myself so all I did was chant to myself ""I want to die"" and pulled my hair out from time to time in the classroom as I cried. 

Still. I would consider that the most painful experience I had in my entire life. Ended up distancing myself away from my classmates after I had enough of the teasing and had an ""Episode"". Didn't do anything drastic at least. Just tried to hit my bully with a chair but he ran laughing. After that everyone ignored me for like 4 years even after the start of highschool. Blah. Just hope I'll be able to see a doctor soon and my parents will finally understand how to treat me, instead of them always saying ""Believe in Jesus. exercise more. Stop being Lazy"" etc,"
"26? The answer is B. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once you peel back the veil of reality and stare in to its seemingly unending dark, cold, lifeless void of nothingness, you are allowed to share in those existential moments, along with the rest of us. 

After making those observations and relishing in the negativity for a time, there will come another moment where you move past it. When you realize that life is only important because it appears to be finite. When you embrace that, things change. You find a better way to eat. You make more social connections. You upgrade your living status/job/sex life.

Playing the game of life becomes a joyous occasion in which you can callously laugh and chortle at how negatively you approached it before. Taking the time to smell the roses and finding something that truly brings you joy becomes the norm. Some people can get there, others can't. Some people kill themselves because of it, unfortunately.

There is another side to this boardgame. You are at a point where your self-realization has brought you to doom and gloom. Once this apex is surpassed, you can look back on it with a more mature, optimistic perspective. Don't get lost in it. Because no one really gives a shit about your shit but **YOU.** And only you can see that and appreciate it for what it is."
"I can at least relate. I get an uncomfortable sensation in my chest and arms. It feels like a tickle on my insides, or like I have bugs crawling in my rib cage or that I need to scratch the inside of my rib cage. Makes me short tempered and irritable because is so constantly uncomfortable. Will last for days, weeks, months. 

I haven’t really figured out why I get it. Sometimes it seems like it comes with anxiety, but sometimes it feels like I get anxiety because of the sensation. 

I’ve heard that sometimes it can be from a vitamin deficiency, like folic acid or b12. I do have anemia, but it is a genetic thing for me and doctors don’t know how to fix it (they tell me to take folic acid but it really does nothing for my hemoglobin levels). 

I’ve found that deep tissue pressure helps me. I’ve asked my boyfriend to hold my wrist (cause I feel it in my arms) real tight or lay on my chest. It’s weird but it helps. Sometimes playing violin helps me too. It’s like the vibration from the sound waves and through the bow settles the tickle a little. Intense physical exercise also helps, but I’m waiting on an ankle surgery at the moment so that’s a no go right now. Lol. Fml. 

I also have noticed that sometimes I am shaming myself, but it’s so engrained that I don’t noticed myself having negative thoughts, it just goes straight to the emotion. For example, it’s hard to get out of bed w depression so I end up a little late to work sometimes. I wonder why I feel horrible in my chest. Realize it’s in part because my body automatically went to feeling shame before I could even have the thought “I am a lazy, horrible inconsiderate person”. Took me a while to realize this. I’m working on changing those beliefs and using “positive reinforcement” to motivate myself. "
"There's a lot to unpack and address in what you just said, so I'll start here; you are a really bright kid. You lay out your thoughts and feelings in a very well-written and easy to understand manner. Not only that, but you're obviously very introspective and self-aware. 

I'm not a medical professional, so I can't diagnose you, of course, but I can tell you that the sorts of feelings you're having (or the lack thereof) can be symptomatic of a depressive episode (or episodes), but I have a feeling you already realize that. You've been through so much in your short life that many other people never have to experience at all. But, you're brave. Not just because you were able to withstand those situations, but because you're realizing that those situations are affecting you now, and you're asking for help. Asking for help can be scarier than the things that truly scare us, because we always wonder if someone won't take us seriously. 

The best advice I can give someone your age is to talk with an adult you trust. Maybe a trusted teacher, a school guidance counselor, a religious leader you trust, the parent of a friend. Write down how you feel and the thoughts you've been having and show it to them, if it would help. Maybe even show them this post you've made. 

I sincerely hope you are able to get the help you need. You don't deserve to feel the emptiness you describe, the emptiness that so many of us know all too well. 

As a parting thought, I again want to address your writing. You have what's often called the ""Gift of Gab."" If you're unfamiliar with that term, it means you are very eloquent. (Technically ""Gift of Gab"" is about speech, but it applies to writing, too.) Not everyone has the command of the English language that you do, especially at your young age. So, I have a small challenge for you. Share that gift. It doesn't have to be right now while you're hurting. But one day, when you feel better, share your gift with the world. That may seem like a tall order right now, but that's something you'll figure out. I have faith in you."
"Have you heard of the Anger Iceberg?   


That seems like a whole lot of work (physically, mentally, emotionally) to track someone down and end their life because they made some mean comments. If you took about half the intense energy you have towards nasty people online and put it towards bettering yourself, learning skills, gaining more confidence, etc you would inevitably progress over time.   


Your external circumstances suck, theres no sugar coating the fact that your family relationship is toxic and triggering,  your living situation in the middle of nowhere is limiting, and you don't have much support or resources available. These are things that are out of your control ATM, but what about the things you DO have some control over? They may not be significant things, but there must be some minor things that you have some sort of control over or can decide for yourself. Focus on those little things. You say no one will listen to you or ridicules you, but even on this thread you've made on reddit, there are others who are sending you good energy, wishing you luck and giving you kindness and suggestions. It's not much, it won't change any of the issues in your life obviously, but it's still something, it still counts as receiving some support in some way.   


And yes you really sound like you have zero compassion for yourself. If a person was told from a young age that they were stupid and useless over and over again, where would they even get the confidence to attempt to learn or educate themselves in anyway when they just believe they're stupid and useless anyways.  You have shitty circumstances, but that doesn't define you as ""garbage"" or define your life as a ""failure"".  It seems like you focus a lot of energy on the anger you get from other people who have better external worlds, but are mean assholes, yet get to enjoy happy lives. Do you ever look at people who ALSO have difficult lives, yet push to make a good life for themselves despite what their limitations are, and learn from their strength and drive? It makes a huge difference what we choose to focus on. Basking in anger and bitterness is not gonna motivate or inspire you in anyway.   


So to answer your question in the title.. : NEVER. Don't accept that you are a failure simply because your external circumstances are inconvenient and difficult. Don't tell yourself you are a failure, ever. Dig deeper to find out your true worth, what your passionate about, who you really are beneath all the anger and suffering.  I hope you start believing in yourself soon

Everyone in the world has some degree of narcissism. It's only when it becomes severe and affects your relationship with others that it could be considered a personality disorder. But I'm not a professional so if you're worried maybe go see a therapist for a professional opinion.
"I am so sorry to hear this. That is exactly how I attempted and I got found out too (and put in the hospital), so I can relate. Just be there for him, and be as supportive as you can. I hope he can get help for his problems and I hope you both can heal. Take care and lots of hugs."
"I sincerely believe all of it. Again, it's funny that you chided me for taking liberties in reading into my co-worker's feelings when you, yourself, will insist that you see straight through a situation where you didn't even grasp an accurate idea of the power dynamic between us. "
I started writing things down in a notebook when I had any bad thought or experience. They ussually come out much darker than expected when you allow yourself to just write it down. You can show it to psychs and therapist. It really makes a difference and expresses your pain well
"I've used the headspace app but only until the trial ended. Not sure it's worth the cost. This is vid that helps me when felling stressed or anxious: https://youtu.be/6kVVrE_sCNA

You could be right on finding the time, it would probably help me a lot more if I did it more often. "
"If I were you, I'd tell my doctor and then try a different anti-depressant. I tried two SSRIs and both of them didn't do well with my body before I tried an SNRI that worked well for me. I also started taking the SNRI at the same time that I started seeing a therapist once a week."
"Of course, I hope it helps. If I don't play something like the ones I mentioned and just try to sleep, I can't. I honestly go numb from those thoughts and start panicking. But making my brain so bored from the apps makes me fall asleep while playing them, so it really helps out xx"

"Thank you for this post. A lot of the time my depression hits and I completely lose all hygiene skills in the process. Honestly, it’s pretty horrible and I feel horrible about it when I level out again. I’m going to set an alarm on my phone so I remember to do this every day. "
"Thank you for your input and help. I haven't had anything traumatic happen to me as a kid, or nothing I deem as ""traumatic"". Hopefully I'll be able to find someone to help me, though. Help me figure out what's going on and help me release all this pent up emotion in a healthy way."
"Welbutrin, but that was after a lot of trial and error. Meds are tricky - I tried a few, and not going to lie, &amp; coming off of some of them was a bitch. I do also take CBD daily. I don't know if that's legal for you, but it's something that I think has helped (very small dose)"
What ever you do don’t give up on your goals. It’s hard when loved ones aren’t supportive but don’t quit. Just keep going to school and working towards your degree. If they won’t let you live there anymore then find another place to live but keep going. You can do this!
"Yes, for me it's like I'm more anxious after a panic attack, that can last a couple of hours to days. What helps for me, is trying to get back into the rhythm of eating, exercising and working at normal hours and especially stay in contact with other. Talking helps. Goodluck &lt;3"
"You don't have to do that. Death is the only guarantee we have in life, so why not see what else there is, get everything you can from it before clocking out? Get new friends, move, apply for a new job or two... but please don't join those statistics. There is always another way. "
"haha sorry i assumed your gender broham ahah

"so watching horrible videos to suppress normal human emotion and become desensitised to things that you’re supposed to be revolted by is a sound idea? if you dislike the advice people give on this sub then don’t come on here, at least don’t give out deplorable “advice”. "
"I agree with this. In my experience the professionals try to make assumptions about what's in my head. And I dont like that. But I have problems describing what's in my head, but my S.O. has got a fairly good sense of what I'm feeling and helps ground me. But also his being witness to what fuels my anxiety and depression helps me get an outsiders opinion without having to pay out for hours of trying to get someone new to understand. Also it's less people I have to talk to about it, less people i have to trust with my information. 
"
"I checked myself in to the psych ward once when I was suicidal. I was in a locked ward and the only phone was in the main lobby near the front desk, we could make limited phone calls and they were all monitored. I was supposed to be in there for 3 days, but couldn't take being locked up after 2. I checked myself out against medical advice which wasn't easy. She may have been bad off enough that they instituted legal hold on her and are limiting her phone calls to people to keep from triggering her. It's a tough go man, I'm sorry. 
"
"I have scars all over my arms, and it seems sick and twisted, but I feel as if they are a badge of courage for me. I don't hide them, and if anyone asks, I tell them what I used to do. I guess because I haven't self-harmed in a very long time (years now) that I look back at my life then and see how bad it was then, and how much better it is now. I feel like my scars say ""I have been through some really bad times, but I have survived, and am a better person for it now..."" :)   


I hope you can find peace. I do understand that pain."
"I struggle with binge eating disorder and I know the struggles that come from someone not realizing they may be sabotaging me in my recovery.  Have you sat down with her and explained what boundaries you need to have. She may not realize that by asking you to help her that it would hurt you. I would talk to her about and set strict boundaries, whatever those need to be. For me it’s not having certain foods in the house as well as other things. Great job on working on your recovery and talking to your dietitian when you needed to."
"I'm really sorry to hear about your brothers struggles, I know how hard it can be on the family too. I used to self medicate a lot, I'd drink to drown the voices out, overdose on sedatives to sleep (sleep is a huge issue for me, I sleep on average 3 days a week) and self harm so the voices would stop telling me to do it. I'm proud to say I don't drink or use any drugs though, however I'm still working on the self harm. All I want to find is peace. I hope you have good cherished memories with your brother when he had the good times."
"Im not gay so i cant feel the same struggle.

But i somehow have tried everything possible to try to fit in the world but no im stuck i even feel ""rejected by rejects"" if you get what i mean.
The only thing ive manage to survive is work get stuff done home then get sedated and its rinse and repeat. But i guess it just take a longer time for us to get noticed. What i am doing now is trying to get promoted as fast as possible to rise above other (not in an a**hole way) but im gonna take that time and use it for something more useful."
"Men and women can share emotions exactly the same, it’s just that men have been socially programmed to not talk about feelings. Just because you’re a women doesn’t mean that it makes it easier emotionally. Talking about it forces it to the front and is the first step.  I’m not saying that it’s magic and as soon as you share, a weight’s lifted off your shoulders. To be honest, it’s still so fresh for me, I still haven’t really come to terms with my feelings. But seeing them written down helps organise those feelings."
"No i'm not seeing a psychiatrist right now, Although. I would like to, but I can't as the closest psychiatrist to me is a 2 hour + drive away, and as you can tell by my post that would be to risky and stressful for me. I could possibly see about communicating with him through email though.

Also I'm afraid that I'll be institutionalized if I tell anyone about these voices. It happened to a schizophrenic who lives in the same town as me. He was put in monitored care because they saw him wandering on the roads at 4 am in the morning."
"Yeah it's important to let that stuff out. My recommendation, try to be alone in your room or a room. Get some headphones or if you're alone you can put the speakers up, go online and start looking for songs that make you feel things. I can't say which ones work for me will work for you. but usually sad songs or mixing from powerful songs, some that you know the words to to sad ones. Just play whatever   songs you feel you might be feeling in. If it's there, the feelings, they might come out. All you can do is try. That's one way. "
"Good for you for having a job.

&amp;#x200B;

Life doesn't follow a narrative like a movie, so don't compare your real life to a feel-good rom-com or you'll just be disappointed.  If you were living as that other person you idolize you might find that they really don't have it all together as much as you think.  Most people cover up their problems rather than be open about them.  And in those cases where someone does have a spoiled and privledged life, they are often the ones who are least capable of handling the hardships that naturally are going to come.  They just don't have practice developing coping skills.

&amp;#x200B;

You are probably doing better than you give yourself credit for.  And others are probably struggling more than they would ever let the rest of the world know."
"I don't think you're overreacting. This may be an unpopular opinion... but personally... I would change therapists. You don't need an another stressor added to your pain. Feeling safe and free of judgement is crucial to your treatment plan.   
    
    
I have found that a middle-age female therapist to be the best fit. I have had my fair share of therapists and learned that I can't be myself around male therapists (due to my previous sexual trauma) and with  much older female therapists-  I feel like she couldn't relate or I would feel judged because I would see her as an authority figure. My therapist is in her late 40s and it's like confiding to an older, wiser aunt... someone I can be open with and trust without having any internal hang-up's that can distract me or hold me back."
"I’ve been feeling decent. About as good as I can feel, I guess. I hardly ate (nothing for breakfast, a couple chips and jalapeño for lunch) for some reason even though it was some of my favorite food, I bought a whole 24 pack of water and I’m gonna start drinking that rather than pop. I’ve been trying to hype myself up for the last 4 hours to tell my mom about what I feel and what I should do for treatment, but I’m getting terrified and talking myself back out of it. I’m so close, the closest I’ve ever been to telling anyone. I’m waiting on my legs to just pick me up and take me to her. I want her boyfriend to leave and the kids to go somewhere else, but I don’t want to make them clear out because they’ll know something is wrong. I’m not sure. Thanks for asking "
"No Lol-ing here - thanks for this actually.  I did some swift googling and found this:

""...a lack of dopamine is associated with:

This describes my entire life for the past 3+ years straight on a downward curve.  When I was consistently hitting my protein macros on my diet (200g, seems impossible), I noticed several of these things dropping off (particularly moodiness and fatigue).  But SURPRISE! I had trouble staying motivated with my diet.

Maybe a good first step.  Considering some tyrosine supplement as well."
"I think you're afraid to feel hope because it's been crushed so many times in the past. And you recognize that this belief is dragging you down, but you don't feel like you're able to control it or alter it because it's been conditioned into your psyche. 

I can't blame you for feeling that way. If you've constantly been let down throughout life by the people around you, why wouldn't you feel that way? Why bother changing things for the better, if you're just going to get crap for it? Or if you're going to get hurt from it? 

The good thing is that you REALIZE that this belief is irrational. It'll take baby steps, but you've got to provide some tangible evidence to your mind that things actually can get better, and STAY better.  It's also important to teach yourself that you are a powerful individual, and you have the ability to control your life and circumstances. Seems like a lot of that power was hidden away from you by your mom.

The unknown is always scary, and if you're not used to feeling happy/better, it can be a really uncomfortable feeling. You might get that voice in the back of your head saying ""why aren't you miserable right now?"" and that's where CBT will help

Also -I'm glad you have a good relationship with your boyfriend. Make sure you use him as a support if need be!"
"Society has rules we have to abide by. If it didn’t all hell would break loose. Could traffic laws be improved in most countries? Probably. But it would be impossible to please everyone. Those friends that you say already have 1-3 accidents.... maybe they’d have even more if speeds weren’t regulated like they are? Yeah speeding doesn’t change the fact if you are a good driver or not, but could you imagine how much worse it would be if all BAD drivers could go a lot faster because of no speed limits? Because honestly, how often do people really admit to themselves that they are a bad driver? So the options are to either let EVERYONE go fast, or instill speed limits to try and minimize the damage done by accidents due to bad drivers. Crashing at 55mph is a lot less lethal than crashing at 90-100 mph, or however fast people would drive if their were no speed limits. Speed limits are a mild inconvenience, but oh well, that’s part of being a part of a society and having the privilege of operating a motor vehicle. 


Again, you sound depressed and angry at the world. The average adult does not get this angry at having to follow the rules of society. Reckless and fast driving can be a symptom of several disorders. I’d suggest speaking to a professional and I hope you get better. "

"I appreciate your well-wishes, thank you! Weirdly enough, since this has been happening for upwards of 6 years its stopped being frightening, which should maybe be scary in and of itself, I guess. I'm just trying to see if there's any resources I can find for this specific feeling."
I don’t have suicidal thoughts but I often have passive suicidal thoughts like “I wish a car would tbone me and kill me.” Or “I wish I wouldn’t wake up in the morning”. These types of thoughts can be just as dangerous. You likely have depression and should see your PCP.
"I've been journaling to piggyback off that. Gratitude journal and my whatever pops into my head journal.

"That pretty much sums it up. I had better days last week, but I exercised on some of those days. I'm running on a ""exercise helps me function like a semi-normal person"" hypothesis. So I'll force myself to the gym tomorrow, so as as I wake up and see if I have a better day tomorrow."

"Find something that makes existence 'worth it'. Its a very simple answer to quite a complex question but the purpose of life is generally what you make of it.

I think you have a few unresolved issues that may go deeper than feeling/knowing your parents resent you, for example. I cant (and no one can) fully understand what it is you're going through from an 11 line blurb, and I would strongly suggest finding some sort of mental health help if you have the means to do so. That being said, it doesn't mean anything is 'wrong' with you."
"Hey. I’ve struggled since 21 find a full time career job that felt manageable. I’m 28 now. My longest was 2 yrs in a marketing job. Also did interspersed 4 yrs of childcare and 1.5 yrs teaching most recently. I spent 60k on grad school to teach, and I had to leave in the middle of my second year because my mental health was so bad.

"I don't know about you, but I find that I ""welcome"" my depression sometimes when it pops up because I am so damned numbed out that it allows me to feel SOMETHING instead of being totally dead inside.

"This hits me hard.  I was once a voracious reader.  I always had a couple of books at hand, not for distraction but for the influx of new ideas and personal growth.

I'm not referring to a summer or two, either.  This was my childhood through my thirties.

I'm now in my forties and haven't been able to read for pleasure in almost ten years.  

For the longest time, I considered that my professional life (and the reading required to maintain it) was the issue, but I struggle with that as well.  

The hellstorm in my head is too loud."
"Writing is definitely a good way to hash out your feelings and figure out how you feel! Mood and dream tracking apps and journaling apps may be something you want to try. It’s always best to be as transparent as possible in relationships, particularly new ones. Just remember that you are strong and can rely on yourself as well, especially when you understand what causes depression for you personally and what kinds of self care help fix it. I think the letter is a great idea, and you can save it for the time that feels most right. "
"You're not to blame at all. I am very sorry it's even something you're having to consider while you are grieving. It is unfair of your mother to make you feel like this, regardless of her own pain. 

My condolences over losing your dad. 

I should point out that he, was equally unfair in 'wishing for a normal child' and while I don't doubt that either care at all, i feel like they also have had they're own mental health issues come to surface during this. Which should remind you, you are definitely not to blame for your dads death. "
"He said he ""looks forward"" to seeing you in drag.  It would be the equalivant of me telling a female client that I look forward to seeing her in her wedding dress.  The word forward is what is problematic to me.  Now you may not mind personally but as a supervisor, i would advise my therapists NOT to attach any personal feelings related to someone's appareance particularly within a sexual context.  But remember i used the term ""borders"" meaning that without any further context of the situation, your feelings, etc... he may not have crossed the line.  But it would give me pause if a female therapist said to me that she looks forward to seeing my outfit or something... that's all.  Is that clearer?

Edit: but the main issue here is duel relationship particularly within a kink setting. "
"I'm going through the same situation with my SIL.  She's 56.  Went into complete severe psychosis out of nowhere.  But she had horrible spending habits through the years, would have outlandish reasons to feel protective over her kids.  We didn't clue in. Then one day, BAM - marriage fell apart, house sold, she took sick leave, and the delusions started happening.  Full force.  For 1 solid year. Non stop. She didn't think anything was wrong with her. She refused to take meds and see a doctor.     


But yeah - it's not common but schizophrenia can happen later in life. But you would have to be susceptible to it.  It just doesn't happen to anyone.  The person you are talking about most likely may have had symptoms but they weren't considered to be much of anything until they got worse."
"Have you tried going to therapy? If you've already tried therapy then I seriously recommend going to an intensive outpatient program. I'm turning 20 next week and this is going to be the first time I'll actually have friends to hang out with on my birthday. I used to be exactly how you described, I sat in the back of the class, isolated myself while also longing for friendship, and I was just really angry and closed off. But I've been going to an intensive outpatient program for 5 months now, and I honestly feel like I'm a completely different person. I used to think that I hated being around people and talking, but it turns out I actually love being around people and talking to them. I feel like my social skills and confidence has improved enough to the point that I've been able to make great friendships with people in the outpatient program and in school. It's going to feel though at first but I seriously recommend that you try out an intensive outpatient program. And if you ever need someone to talk to you can just PM at any time. "
"maybe the question you need to ask yourself then, is: ""is this about me, or is this about him?"". Your partner (i assume) has done this before - especially if the friend can identify your partner's coping mechanisms right off the bat. And if he's done it before (without you there), he can do it again.

 Thus, it might hurt for me to say this - but it's possible that he actually doesn't need you there holding his hand every step of the way. Grieving is extremely intimate, and he'll need to process his emotions at his own pace. There's nobody that can do that for him. I know what it's like watching a loved one go through this, so I know how difficult it can be to take a step back.

You are allowed to sleep and take care of yourself. The only block (that i'm perceiving from this post) is your own expectations of yourself (ie. ""i need to always be there for people i love. I am a caretaker""). Take a rest. You deserve it. You sound like an amazing partner, but sometimes there's only so much that any of us can do. Take care of yourself first."
"Reading what you have written wasn't easy.

It's easy for your Mother to blame you, she's angry, upset and hurt, nonetheless, she shouldn't be blaming you. Mental health/illnesses are just as valid (and difficult) as physical conditions, if you had lost your legs in an accident would she still be saying this. Mental illness is just as severe, if not more severe than physical illnesses and there isn't any point tormenting yourself over things that happened in the past.

Realistically your condition no doubt did cause your father a lot of stress, but that's life, things happen and shit hits the fan, it's just life. Tormenting yourself, having your mother torment you over it isn't any good. She is just causing more problems. I don't know if you live with your mother or if you have your own home, if you have your own home stay away and give her time, if you live with her then maybe look at moving out if that is a possibility. Her attitude is just going to bring you down. What she is doing is selfish. You didn't plan on being born and suffer from schizophrenia, it just happened, it's luck of the draw. Some people go through life without mental health problems, some people judge others and think they are weak while being ignorant and uneducated as to the issues others are suffering from.

My Mother died aged 23 suffering from years of mental health problems, I too have found myself stood looking down from a great height wondering whether to jump to my death, as well as stockpiling pills. Anxiety has been my main issue (I can go out walking at 4am through dangerous parts of town, but can't cope with day to day life and dealing with people). I get anxious over things that others wouldn't think about (electromagnetic waves, tumours \[every kind, benign and malignant\], everything that you could worry about I worry about). At times for lengthy periods, I become depressed to the point that I don't move from the bed.

I was raised by my Gran, growing up she treated me as though I was a disappointment, I think she feels ashamed of me because I don't work (I am 24 years of age, was a conscientious kid in school, people expected me to go on and go to uni and go into a good career), but I quit school without any qualifications and have never worked. I quit for good reason because mentally I couldn't do any more, I found myself taking handfuls of pills to end my life around age 14 (I took them with water, had I taken them with alcohol I doubt I'd be here), I couldn't cope at the time. A lot of people judged me (teachers, neighbours, school kids in my school, etc.), people are very good at doing that.

Don't beat yourself up anymore, it isn't worth beating yourself up, I don't know if you are doing this, but if your mother keeps putting the blame on you and she tells you it's your fault for long enough then you'll start to believe it. Don't listen to her, it isn't your fault that your father is dead. It also isn't your fault that you suffer from an illness.

Am sorry for your loss as well, it's difficult enough losing someone with someone else assigning blame."
Agreed. Sooner the better.
Bit slow but just PM'd you!
Favourite litterary genres?
Feel free to dm if you need
Good to know thanks so much
Have you read The Republic?
"Hit me up geezer, ill talk."
How are you feeling today?
I am here to talk with you.
I meant with silly jokes :(
I really want to be asleep.
It can be a double bind :(
It is a learning disability
Killing myself after school

Of course! Be positive!!!!!
Okay. I think I Understand.
Sit down and talk with her.
Sounds good.  I'll be here!
Stop fapping and get a Job.
Thank you SO much!!!!!!!!!
"Thank you, this is helpful."
Thanks. You are very brave.
Thankyou I appreciate it :D
"That means a lot, thanks.

"
"This is amazing, thank you!"
What are you talking about?
Yep. In Pakistan actually.
Yes I have. We got nowhere
You are insulting yourself
i will increase my dosage.
it may be bipolar disorder
lol no one saw my nickname?
thanks for your wise words.
thats a sociopath... leave
Bro I do it all the time. But what I know is I won’t meet the people I have now if I push the reset button. So sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t push the reset button cos the people I have now (a handful of them) are priceless. I’m sure you have amazing people in your life too
"But she *is* a burden. She seems to enjoy wreaking havoc on our family, and if she doesn't want help, I can't make her take it. I gave up on her the moment she gave up on herself, and now I want my life back so I can help my wife and other daughter heal from the damage she's caused."
Could you reach out to a grief group? Your brother's death is clearly affecting you and there may be low cost or free grief counseling or groups you can connect with. I hope you can find some people to connect with even if it's through your grief. No one should have to suffer alone.
"Go talk to someone. I am a...Firebug. (Still can't say the proper name for it ugh!) We all have something different about ourselves...we all have failings, good stuff, weird stuff about us. Go see someone professional and they can help you through it. I hope you feel better...hug!!!"
"Hey thanks for this. I haven’t seen a therapist regularly since 2016 and I don’t have health insurance due to costs right now. I’ve had sporadic bouts of therapy when I have the money, but I should probably look into emotional regulation on my own. I appreciate your response! "
"I like this. I really agree with fighting. You have to put effort into it and try, otherwise you stay in the same place..  Getting out is definitely like getting more of your senses back, it feels like sound, vision, feeling, and smells get turned back up to their ""normal"" volumes.."
"I might disagree with the armchair personality disorder stuff, but I 100% agree that this guy is abusive and trying to make you stay by blaming it on his depression. It puts you in a role where you feel bad for being harmed by his actions and one in which you feel obligated to help."
"I understand your battle, I feel this way every day. The best way to help them is to live and be there for them, no matter what. I don’t know what this person is to you, whether an SO or a friend or family, but just be supportive. Love them. Treat them. Be who they want you to be."
"I'm just saying that,  considering your abusive language toward the mother of your children, that maybe,  just maybe she isn't the only one being abusive. 
In terms of kids,  it doesn't matter who started it,  they are going to side with the parent who is least threatening to them. "
"I'm watching the movie and sometimes it's like I read but my brain doesn't quite register it. I never really liked reading books, but after the depression I read a paragraph and I don't remember how it started. I don't know if it has something to do with the antidepressants or not. "
"I've been through so many. Some were meh, and some I really liked. But all of them still stayed focused on this idea of self care and coping, and I feel like I've learned all I can learn in that. I guess I'm wondering if that's all therapy is, or if there's anything else it can do. "
"If you don’t have income and you are ill, a hospital will figure out how to set you up with Medicaid until you’re on your feet for private insurance. 



Head to a hospital with a psychiatric emergency room if you’re seriously considering self harm; no one will deny you help. "
"If you enjoy being alone, how can that be bad?  Do what you enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be a different story if you said you desperately want to be around others but have social anxiety that keeps you from it.  The only downside I see is if you want friends later all of a sudden."
"I’ve been taking a medication that’s supposed to be for anxiety, but it hasn’t been helping much. It’s been a real headache for me to get psychiatric help (psychiatrists just keep sending me off to different people), so it may be a while until I can get a new prescription..."
"Mindfulness is like turning your computer off and on again.   If you don’t turn yourself off and on you’ll notice a problem but haven’t taken the time to do troubleshooting.   First step is to turn yourself off and on again with mindfulness, and then see if it fixes the issue."
"Most people think about suicide the same way they think about robbing a bank or murder. As long as you aren't taking tangible steps to do it there is no thought police. 

I think it's way too overrated that if you've contemplated suicide that itself is symptomatic of anything else. "
"NO, I am mentally ill, thank you. ;) He doesn't know about this, the kids have no clue, and I am keeping it that way. I don't need another stay in the Psych ward thanks. UGH...that is all I need.   


I am in control and I would never burn my house down. I am fond of this place lol."
"Therapist need to know what your flaws are to help you if you dont want to fix them then whats the reason to go to therapy in the first place.

The world can be seen in many ways other than what it reality. If you continue the same pattern nothing and no one will bother to help you."
"Who are you comparing yourself with? Everyone's life is different. Stop renewing old contracts on whch you have agreed to suffer because you used to be an outcast.  Life is different, you made it different! Enjoy your hard work and keep up distracted with what really motivates you! "
"Your meds should have come with a little pamphlet which exhaustively lists all the potential side effects. Did you check that? If it's not on there then you should go back to your doctor to ask about it.

I have had a myriad of side effects on different SSRI / SNRIs but never those."
"ah, so that negative feeling you get... is it like a sad rainy day type of negative or a scary/worried type of negative? 

From what you've told me it sounds like it may be anxiety. That's common with depression. And crying more often than usual can also be a symptom of depression. "
there is big debate about the relevance and utility of DSMv diagnoses in the Social Sciences (the labels currently used to 'diagnose' people). Its very likely these will change in future. There are a number of interesting books available on the subject if you care to read about it.
"Finding the right person to help you is paramount to starting the healing process. Find 1 counsellor/therapist and sit in a room alone and talk, nothing else is more powerful then letting that 1 correct person into your mind and tell you exactly what is wrong. 

If you do not agree with what has been given to you then disregard it, it's not worth your time or money on bullshit that isn't going to help you improve. An IQ test is not something, in my own experience, that should be conducted when assessing someone's mental health state."
"God. God is real. You can't truly be happy without believing in God. Unfortunately, you DO bring on the bad stuff. Think of it like electricity. Positive pulls in positive energy. Negative pulls in negative energy. You probably don't realize you do negative things all the time. Start doing positive things. Positive things ADD to your life. Negative things TAKE from your life. The Bible tells you how to live positively. Adding to your life. It's like a compass. Letting you know what is positive and what is negative. ADD to your life. "
"I think it’s best to be open with the idea of medication. Hey, you’re at least giving the thought to trying which is an amazing step! Have a chat to your doctor or psychiatrist about what options might be best to you. Some antidepressants can be better suited to some symptoms than others. Medication isn’t a life sentence. It’s giving you the chemicals to be able to function and to be able to build a foundation off of to function on a day to day basis. It’s not an end all cure, it just helps things along. One step at a time."
"I understand. What I would ask myself is ""Is there a real reason to worry about this, or am I just pulling a ""what if?"""" If you're just asking yourself ""what if?"", it is probably good to just accept that the thought comes from your OCD. If you start arguing with yourself about if the thought is a real threat, it will get worse. When a thought comes, say ""hello"" and move on, if you know what I mean. Think about something else. Eventually, it will leave. It's great to hear that you're taking medication, too. That's a big step, already."
"It’s tough to hear but your best bet is seeing a a therapist for your conditions. People who are not mentally ill are not equipped to help you through the times you may need them most because they have never experienced what you have. A therapist on the other hand, is trained to guide you through panic attacks, life issues and feeling overwhelmed. Therapists are able to bring you a fresh perspective. Especially after you’ve been running in circles forever in your head. If you do decide to talk to someone, let me know how it goes."
"Luckily we’d both taken a week off work so I don’t have that worry just yet either. Whereas I don’t live all that far away from friends and family, (maybe about half hours drive from good friends) I don’t think I’m in a head space to be able to concentrate on driving enough so that’s causing a bit of a barrier. 

I desperately want to find a way to fix it, but I think we both need to question that if it did somehow miraculously fix, would I be the same again? I don’t know if we’d ever be able to get the same bond back"
"Having that toxic mindset IS A SYMPTOM of mental illness. Being crazy is a verb. Having those thoughts is one kind of symptom of maybe ocd, depression, anxiety, etc. The more those thoughts occur unchecked, the further and further those thought patterns will reinforce themselves. There is certainly a physical component to mental illness; be it genetics or whatever, but the brain is powerful. If you think paranoid thoughts often, you become more paranoid. Do it enough and you can actually change your brain in physical ways. For example if you have thoughts that give you a dopamine rush, the more you have those thoughts the more you change dopamine levels in your brain which can then change other things for you. You can certainly drive yourself insane by indulging in unhealthy thinking "
"I have an ""I'm not anorexic, I'm anxious and depressed"" story.. 

I told my doctor that I was having trouble with my weight because going to the kitchen of my shared home gave me anxiety. I did not feel safe around my housemates and therefore would stay in my room in order to avoid potentially encountering them. My doctor heard ""the kitchen and food make me feel unsafe"" and misdiagnosed me with anorexia. 

Moral of the story, not everyone can listen. My advice, you could ask your boyfriend to encourage you to take your clothes with you if he sees you headed that way. Not every time (that would be considered nagging) but a gentle reminder.. or if he wants to be a stellar man he could ask if the clothes are dirty and if he can take them for you. If it's really that difficult for him to remember that you have a chronic illness, involve him in the routine; take medicine, visit psychiatrist, feel crappy, call therapist, feel better, take medicine, lather, rinse, and repeat. Eventually he won't forget or he won't be there to be an arsehole. "
"I agree with this. My psychatrist sort of listens to the abbreviated summary of what happens between our month to month appointments, but his job is to focus on your physical symptoms only, he's a doctor. He prescribes medications that help your nervous system behave. Like yesterday I went there and told him about this one episode I had between visits, I kept it brief. He's like ""that sounds like a panic attack"". Told him my counselor said it's related to my PTSD, he nodded ""yes that's normal, it can come from a dream, a memory... if it's isolated like that you can take half of your \[anti-anxiety daily pill\] to get the chest pain to go away (stomach and chest tightness is the main reason my brain sort of goes on self-destruct mode). He's nice, but to the point at the same time. I kinda understand as my dad is a surgeon, I don't take it personal. That is why the other element is the counselor they are the ones that will listen to you talk your heart out about your feelings and give you feedback on that instead. That is why they do hour-long appointments.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk about the loaded questions, maybe it was a misunderstanding or maybe he indeed was TOO cold and made you feel uncomfortable, that's not cool. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt but you can always try someone different. Just keep expectations real from this new perspective. The ""nurturing"" and feelings part is the counselor's job, the doctor is analytical and he focuses on your brain/body. Like, all I expect from him is to keep up with my meds so that I don't have panic attacks and can focus on my day to day life and I do the rest of the work myself going to my counselor when I need to talk, staying away from stress and reading on self-development. My appointments with my psychiatrist are barely 10 min long, if that.

&amp;#x200B;

Example appointment (for me, yesterday):

Him: How have you been this month?

Me: Been well, no mood swings, no anxiety-related chest or stomach pain... I had this very bad day where my chest was going to explode and I considered checking myself into the ER because I could not bare the pain...but I went for an hour walk for lunch time (I had to run an errand anyway) and it helped me calm down. My counselor said it's PTSD symptoms and we're working on it.

Him: Yeah, that can happen, it's normal. Even if there's no trigger it can come from a dream, a memory. But it's normal. In those bad cases you can take half of your pill to curve your chest symptoms, which should help you calm down.

Me: Cool.

Him: Do you need a new refill or you still have enough?

Me: Yeah I don't have enough for a full month.

Him: \[writes prescription\] Ok. Let's get you an appointment for next month. You're doing good.

Done.

&amp;#x200B;

My counselor gets to hear all the dumpster my mind is, on the other hand. :P"
Any more info on the urges?
Certainly wouldn’t hurt :)
Huuug to you. I understand.
"I do as well, occasionally. "
I hope everything works out
I hope the same for you. ❤

Much love to you thank you!
My goodness. Thank you &lt;3
Please go to the doctor SOON
Professor in his/her office.
Seclusion is a helluva drug
Sounds like a panic attack.
Sounds like bipolar disorder
Take it one day at a time...
Thank you for your feedback!
Thank you for your response.
Thank you for your response.
Thank you! Good luck to you!
Thank you. Fingers crossed.
Thanks for the kind words :)
Thanks for your help however
Thanks for your information.
This is so wholesome. ❤️
Yeah I understand it though.
Yes. Everyday and I hate it.
You can look it up yourself
hey what med worked for you?
what kind of work do you do?
"**Be kind to yourself!** Accept whatever you learn about yourself, take it in with compassion and no judgement. Imagine if a good friend told you something highly personal and embarrassing about themselves... you'd want them to feel safe and supported. Do the same for yourself &lt;3 "
"Amazing job, I relate to your story so much and it feels comforting to actually hear someone else describe the pain I’m going through on a daily basis. You should definitely keep doing videos, you are a very good talker and you speak about relevant topics, unlike 99.9% of YouTubers"
"Happy Birthday for last week :)

Monday isn't too far away! And weekends are for staying in bed anyway, lie to yourself that you're doing it on purpose and it'll be Monday before you know it and you'll be able to sort therapy and that is a step in the right direction. Small steps. :)"
"I nicked a big chunk out of my leg today with a pair of industrial quality scissors 

About a week ago I ripped my leg up and about gave myself a concussion outside my psychiatrist's office building. 

Those seem to be the way the people in my life prefer for me to cope with things. "
"I'm sorry you are struggling right now. It can be hard to be vulnerable, especially when you're not doing well. Just remember that your friendly neighborhood therapist will listen without bias and not be put out: it's literally their job, lol. I hope things turn around for you ❤️"
"It's such a simple tactic, and yet it's so effective. I used to really grapple with being a hypochondriac, but reminding myself in the moment that it's anxiety has helped immensely. ""You aren't having a heart attack, a stroke, or an aneurysm. It's just anxiety. Finish your sandwich."""
"It’s not simply loneliness. That is minimizing  my situation. My situation is the same type of thing as slavery, just not the same magnitude.

I’ve already tried everything you said. Now it is your turn: what is going to be enough? 

You don’t really understand my “plight.”"
Just try to remember that she doesn't define who you are. You can still get through this. Even if she's trying to drag you down in the process. Just focus on your studies so that you can make something out of your life. And then you'll be able to get out of there as soon as possible.
That’s my first thought as well because he did say to my manager he don’t want to work on that night because he want to join us. He said this 2 days before the d-day. I also forgot to mention that he cried the day before during the work because he is sad that he couldn’t come.
"The average age of onset of schizophrenia is the late teens to the early 20s for men, and the late 20s to early 30s for women.  So while the premise of early diagnosis is generally a good one for many mental illnesses, it unfortunately doesn’t apply (as readily) for schizophrenia. "
Try this stop taking it for a week so your body is completely clean of zoloft and write how and what you feel then restart it and after sometime again write how and what you feel compare it and if you think its worth it keep taking it if not stop and tell your therapist to change it.
"Usually dissociation is just a symptom of a underlying problem and not the problem itself, although it can be.  

What causes it can be a huge amount of things, as always i would recommend talking to a professional but the Wikipedia page should give you plenty of stuff to read up on."
Very good question. Stevo kinda talked about this in one of his interviews where he  believes and claims his psychotic episodes were actually just a different reality only percieved by people with psychosis. Its actually kinda interesting but really nutty search up stevo ghost story.
Well...I just have a lot going on that I don’t think is being taken seriously. Probably because I always summarize and forget to include ALOT so I’ve been writing stuff down and I have a long list. But I’m too nervous to read it off or hand it to them I need more confidence ugh
"While having pyromania may not be a good thing, getting a diagnosis **is**. The only thing that changes is that now you know, and you care team knows, and it's a bit easier to figure out what to do next, so you can start living a better life. I get that it hurts, but congratulations."
"do you have a panic disorder and gen anxiety as well? I felt that as soon as I overcame my panic attacks and dealt with my anxiety disorder in general, my hypochondria went away with it. You need to get to the root of the problem, rather than treating each isolated incident I think. "
"&gt; I think you will have a hard time finding any therapist of any stripe to agree to such a notion.

if a therapist doesnt share my core values, then theres no point in therapy. i dont want a therapist to try to indoctrinate me with liberal ideas nor do i want a conservative christian therapist who tries to bring me back into the fold (that's happened)

well i have to agree that the high education level and high empathy level found among psychotherapists and psychiatrists tends to correlate with liberalism. thats the problem for me."
"I didn't cheat, no. But it was a betrayal of trust, so it's the same sort of context (and severity unfortunately). Sorry to be vague, it's an uncomfortable subject.

Exactly, it's all about when you're ready! Take as much time as you need, talk to people, get your head straight, and you'll know what the right choice for you is. He has to respect that space and time. And it's true some may judge, but you know you and if you choose to forgive then they should support you in that. Following your heart isn't stupid, love can be very wise."
"I’m just gonna say it even tho it’s been stated in the first comment.

Their ignorance just makes you so defensive... Even they being quiet would be much better after you said something that they might feel “just shake it off”. 

I would also say these kinds of people are not very open minded when it comes to discussions. 

I would spend as little time as possible with them. Only necessary communication. 

Depending of course how uncomfortable they make me feel, maybe they pass more negativity over you on other things as well."
"I’m so so sorry that you are going through this. I’m in a similar situation and it is so hard to even think straight, I know. Tackle one thing at a time. As far as your ex, remind yourself over and over if you have to, that no decent man would treat someone like that, especially their child’s mother. Focus on your child. Their smiles and hugs are worth everything, and your there  to see it! Those smiles and hugs are for you! A job will come through, things happen when you least expect it, and most of the time, it will work out. "
"Seems all logical and reasonable, actually it's how his friend copes. Idk if my partner has lost anyone this close to him before. I'm doing my best to just be here. I hate feeling this helpless, but I know he needs time. I'm just exhausted and making a mountain out of a mole hill. I do my best when it comes to the people I love. I know what it's like to feel alone in a room full of people. So, I love extra hard. However, I'll take your advice to heart. I've been trying to sleep all morning, but I'm slightly manic and it's not helping."
"That's only because we make it more interesting in our own minds. Life can be pretty terrible. There's no doubt about that. But it can also be pretty amazing too. And that's what gets me out of bed every morning. Because I want to feel that ""amazing"" someday. But I've isolated myself for a long time so far. And each day gets more and more difficult as time goes on. Don't make the same decision as me. You can have a good future. But you can't hide from the world and expect things to ever get better. Don't isolate yourself from society."
"To be honest. I don't really feel comfortable talking to my good friends. I just feel like I'd be a burden. I know that's stupid. It's something I am going to address over the next couple of days. I was very fortunate today, in that I told her old best friend (my wife/ex just sorta phased her out of her life when she got new friends too) and that she dropped everything to listen to me. It was unexpected and very much appreciated. There’s always someone that’s gonna let you vent. Even if you find that person in an unexpected place."
"Hey, thanks again for your support in messages. I just wanted to check-in and let you know that I started the ketamine therapy, which consists of 6 infusions over 2-3 weeks, and I'm through the first 5. It has been a complete game changer!

After the first one, I could already see an improvement at work; I was able to compartmentalize things enough to get things done and not dwell on them. My appetite started to come back. My nightmares were much less intense. After the third one, I could talk about what happened to me without the rising feeling of panic in my chest. While I am still sad about the situation with my wife (who's not leaving me, just wanting a separation...no idea if we'll try again after 6 months), but the depression itself is almost gone. I feel like a different person."
"Probably not what you are going to want to hear, but maybe you can look at her age as a good thing... use it as motivation. Although 4 years doesn’t seem like a lot of time, a lot can happen in 4 years. The fact that she’s so close to your age means she can probably relate to you better than someone who is much older... honestly, I think that her age could actually benefit you if you don’t allow it to hinder your perspective on things. My therapist is about 30+ years older than me and although I really like him, sometimes it would be nice to have someone relate to me better. 

You should always feel comfortable with your therapist... but, I really do think that you should give it a little bit of time before you decide that her age is going to be a problem. 

Best of luck to you! "
"The reason Depression is a condition and not an emotional state is because it isn't always ""earned"". Not having significant emotional trauma doesn't mean you're any less entitled to help.

If you want some ""merit"". I think you're situation might be more difficult than mine. I'm fucked, but I have a pretty good idea why and I can target that stuff in therapy. 

Call your healthcare representative. Depression has a major effect on longterm health,  so your insurance company may he willing to help.

If not, look for ""sliding scale"" services,  they'll work with your income to get you the help you need.

Good luck and remember:

You are not alone, you deserve to be helped, and you can reach out to a number of people here, including me, if you need any perspective or just someone to vent to."
"I am in a very similar situation. We were engaged and I realized I couldn’t do this anymore I was only getting unhappier day by day. I started to feel trapped and worried if I didn’t do it now I never would and I would hate myself in the long run. We live together and like you my ex’s family is here and my family is 11 hours away. I figured the best for me would be to move and live with my family for some time. We spoke about it and luckily the feeling was mutual that we were not doing well as a couple anymore and decided to stay friends.

First things first you have to talk about it with your s/o after time spent together you really shouldn’t leave them blindsided as to what went wrong. I know if I was in their place and I was left with no explanation I’d be a wreck. So definitely do that. Next I’d say to figure out your game plan. I don’t know your individual situation but maybe try and stay with family in the meantime? When I felt leaving was right for me I packed up my car and took the ride. If there’s anything big you can’t fit maybe work it out that you could come back for it or rent a moving truck(if you have the finances) or even a hitch for smaller pieces. If finances are a problem maybe you can borrow from a family member or friend until you get on your feet. "
"It's amazing how many others in the AIWS communities I've found that have exactly the same experience as this. As was my story too. Spending, well, 25 years now (beginning at 6, I'm now 31) having great difficulty explaining the nature of this thing to others, and trying to get some answers. Never getting any. And finally being bought into contact with this not very well understood neurological condition. And suddenly having a whole set of people knowing exactly what I'm talking about. And a load of literature explaining what's actually happening.

You should maybe look into Alice in Wonderland Syndrome yourself. It's commonly cited that this is massively under-diagnosed due to the nature of how it works, how little known the condition is, and how difficult it is to bridge that gap for people that experience these kinds of weird symptoms.

There are various kinds of things that can trigger this stuff. Migrains are a predominant factor, as are forms of temporal lobe epilepsy, or viral infections. Often though it appears on it's own and fades away as sufferers get older. It's not that well understood really, other than there's a definite set of criteria that are symptomatic of the syndrome and diagnosis is generally predicated on the account of the sufferer's description of their episodes."
"My opinion of BPD Im also diagnosed with it. It is not a disorder in itself, its a description of several different factors. I'm not sure without looking it up but i blieve you must have six out of nine criteria to receive a diagnosis, its night and math isnt my best but I looked it up and that means theres 256 distinct combinations that can be considered BPD

If you loom around on the internet you will see a lot of terrible stuff about people with BPD, likely because they were misdiagnosed or were sociopaths who happened to meet one of the set of criteria

As you've said you feel like mess with all these labels remember you are a person, BPD IMO isnt something that appears in a vaccum it is a result of having to deal with all these other problems, I have my own hypothesis on it but I wont share stuff that is still experimental here unless I am asked.

Im having a really hard time now and Il I can say is that just because you have this diagnosis nothing has changed, somebody just matched some stuff up on a chart

As for saying you have so many issues I understand how you feel, but at least IMO it doesnt mean your any more ""fucked up"" its human nature especially for a scientifically minded person to to contextualize and categorize everything, some or most of these diagnosis just may be ways of describing specific effects of the same underlying problem, for example I could tell you have acute bronchitis, histamine release, cytokine release, pyrexia, congestion, myalgia, or I could just say you have the flu, if what Im saying makes anysense "
"This is a tough one because it sounds like you are not very close to your brother, so it might be hard to get through to him.

If he's doing drugs, especially smoking weed, this would be the first thing I would try to address. The ""everyone is against me"" attitude is a classic symptom of smoking too much weed. Depression and suicidal thoughts as well. He may believe that weed is making those symptoms better when it is more likely that it is causing them.

I don't want to focus too much on that because I don't know how much he smokes or what other things might be going on, but it resonated with me and my experience of how long-term smoking can affect me (and the reason I eventually quit).

Does your dad know he smokes? Maybe you could get him to talk to your brother about it, since it sounds like he trusts him. But you also don't want to make him angry - it's a really delicate issue and has to be approached correctly.

All I can say is that it sounds to me like your brother would have a more balanced view on life if he stopped smoking, at least for a few weeks or so to get a feel for what it's like to be sober. If you can think of a way to encourage him to do that then you'll likely be doing him a big favour. At least it'll be a start.

Can you match a pattern in his behaviour to his weed intake, looking back at how he's behaved in the past? If you can show him there's a connection (if there is one) it might help him realise what's causing this.

If you think it's got nothing to do with drugs then disregard this if you like - I'm only basing this on a few loose facts about your brother and my own experience. If you do think it's related, feel free to ask me for more details about my experience, I'll be happy to share. I smoked heavily for about 20 years so I have some experience with it. :)"

"A couple months the first time. Doc told me it could take about 2 weeks to feel any different. Took them for a couple months, didn't notice a difference, stopped taking them, didn't notice a difference, he prescribed them for me again but I haven't bothered with them the second time. "
"And now you're adding delusions and baseless accusations to this. Great! You're really the worst. Also, being brain dead and Autistic are two seperate things. Someone who is brain dead would be in a vegetative state or a coma, and not displaying the traits you seem to despise so much."
I 10000% agree. He needs to be pink slipped and admitted into a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. And this is coming from someone who has been to the psych unit 3 times. You will be at fault if you knew he had these feelings and didn’t do something if he ends up doing something.
"I didn't need to read most of your post to know that she's toxic. It may or may not be her fault.  But it is what it is. 

Its ok to look out for you too. Your relationships can't be about keeping the other person above water all the time,  but drowning yourself in turn.  

God luck! "
"I feel like this sometimes, and tbh what helps me the most is the classic ""living one day at a time"". If you only focus on what you can do right now/today, and realize that the future will only be a combination of all these small (good and bad) actions, it takes a bit of pressure off."
I find it difficult when I'm down to shower too. Self care sometimes makes me feel like I'm being selfish. That's just my brain making me believe that. I'm not here to please other people. I'm learning to be my own friend and self care is a vital part of that. It's hard but I'm trying
I haven’t but I know a couple of people who have. For one person it was life changing and for the other it wasn’t a miracle but it did stop them being suicidal. Hey still have maintenance sessions every so often as well. Definitely worth a try I would say as it is relatively safe.
"Medicine that helps depression can increase manic episodes too. Just keep trying, friend. I’m sad that the so called professionals in your area won’t listen to you. People are wary about self diagnosis, but you’re really the only person who knows what’s going on in your head. "
"Stay here...every minute you spend talking with me is a minute you aren't drinking. One minute at a time if you have to. Keep talking. Ask me questions. I am suffering from Pyromania...I get a LOT of curiosity about that. (Not trying to brag though...trying to keep you distracted...)
"
"Thank you.  Would you call this psychological trauma: feeling unable to have a clear perspective/trust yourself?  Like to a disabling extent..

And if psychological abuse is often unintentional, how do you not feel like it never existed...that you're just imagining or too sensitive .."
Yea that’s basically what I do except with music. It’s kind of been my saving grace because I can’t think about anything else when loud music is blaring into my ears. I especially got into metal music for that reason I think- the heaviness and loudness of it really distracts me.
"Yes. And let me figure out how to elaborate...haha. Ha.  

I tend to backtrack- ""well I feel sad about x, and y makes me angry - well I know it shouldn't and I'm grateful for z so I know I shouldn't be upset and I'll try harder. What was the question?""  

It's obnoxious is what it is."
You really took the words out of my mouth. Sometimes I feel like if I talk about my problems then people think they’re not real. It’s almost like people I know expect people with mental health issues to not be able to talk about it openly. I feel like I made no sense saying that.
"Get clean, stay alive! We need you in the would. You’re important and loved! Please don’t do anything rash, this might be a dark time right now but it gets much better. I’m sure if you just keep at it you will get out the other side. I’ve struggled with depression I know it can be overwhelming but in those times go talk to someone and exercise you wouldn’t believe how useful a chat with another person and some exercise is! Even if it’s just a walk around the block with a friend. Good luck, stay in touch. You’re important."
"Hey man, thought I would give my two cents.
From what you write, you sound perfectly normal. It's ok to be sad without a reason sometimes. Even when you have plenty of reasons to be happy. It might be helpful to talk to someone that knows you and you can trust. It doesn't have to be a professional, it could be grandparents or siblings or friends or a priest or whoever. They are all valuable.
Maybe medication could be helpful, maybe not. Don't be too hard on yourself. Ask that girl/boy out, do that play. Good things are waiting for you."
"Owning it like chuckhart said is a good idea. People don't realize they're hurting us unless we let them see it. If you don't think their jokes are funny, don't laugh. If you get real, you might find they tone it down and get real with you. Or they mention it, you could say something like, ""You know actually, yeah, things have been exhausting lately..."" and then excuse yourself from diving deeper by changing the subject, ""...I think I'm going to go get myself a cup of tea from \[wherever\]. Hey, have a good day, I'll see you tomorrow!"""
The only person thats willing to listen to me is my girlfriend but she has terrible anxiety and i always feel guilty talking to her about it because she gets horrible anxiety attacks when I talk to her about it.  And whenever I go my pediatrician they always ask the questions about your mental health but I have always lied on them because my parents are good friends with the receptionist that works there and if my parents find out theyll just tell me to quit being dramatic. Im not sure what to do I feel like I have nowhere left to turn
"Yah I recently discovered the “nature/nurture” aspect of life and its also made everything seem slightly grim to me. 

Its not too bad though. I always thought life is like a guitar string you have a set path due to nurture and nature but you can still bend the path a bit with little decisions. Sort of like how the string of a guitar can bend up and down a bit. 

For example, you can choose who to marry, what to eat for dinner, and what car to buy. That being said you can’t choose who you’re attracted to, what you like to eat. "
"I didn't ask for proof of their license. In fact, I asked for their details to make a complaint about unethical abuse of power. Since I have not abused my power, you have no basis for a complaint. I'm also English, dipshit. We don't have states over here... Do you not know what the NHS is? I don't require a license for my role. 

Sure, it can be photoshopped. If you think I care enough about your opinion to do that then you are sorely mistaken. Tbh... Even if I did supply more, you'd probably claim I shopped that too.

I mean... What you can do at this point is either realise that you're probably arguing with a professional and there is a deep gulf between your knowledge and mine... Or assume I'm a liar, despite providing the proof you requested... And thus, there's no point continuing."
"I'm 42 and I feel much the same way as you.  I'm surviving...  Minus the long story of my life, I will tell you that being as young as you are, you have lots of time.  My recommendation to you is set some goals for yourself.  Start saving some money, any way that you are able.  When you have saved enough and can afford to make a positive change in your life, do it for yourself and you child. It takes a lot of effort to learn how to behave and make decisions that create the happiness you desire.  If you are unhappy with your boyfriend, make a decision that is good for your happiness.  Be confident in your quest for happiness and do not settle for less.  You only get one life to live and the best happiness is borne from the worst pain.  You already have the pain, so go find the happiness."
"Positive Coping Methods. That's what you need to focus on. Go to the gym. Go to the library. Go to the park. Pick up a hobby. Doesn't matter what it is. You need to stay productive. And you need to force yourself to go out in public. If you sit at home feeling sorry for yourself all day, then nothing's ever going to change. If you're feeling down and have nothing to do, then go take a walk throughout the neighborhood. If you're hungry and wanna get take-out, always do carry out. It'll force you to get out of the house. Which will help with your depression. Remember, stay busy. Keep your mind distracted. And keep yourself productive.

Also, working out is a fantastic coping method. I would highly recommend it. You don't even have to go to the gym. You can find other ways to exercise too."
"To each, their own. Many people hide under a farce of happiness because much of society believe we should be so. Having depression or any other mental health problems is stigmatized, so people feel like they have to keep up with an image of satisfied and happy life. The current state of social media is probably an indication of this trend. If you're feeling overwhelmed, I think it would be wise to cut back. Consider the things you spend time on through the week and decide what you, at your truest core, value the most. You can then prioritize accordingly. Also, open up about what you're going through to those you trust. You never know how many people around you are going through something similar (personal experience). Take my word with a pinch of salt. I'm no expert but I hope it helps."
"I have these thoughts sometimes too. I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything, but sometimes my anxious mind will start to worry about things that I know in my heart not to be true. Things that appear real and frightening in the moment, but silly when I'm calm. For example, there are times when I start to question whether or not I am becoming schizophrenic or am losing my mind and going insane. Even times when I question if I might be a sociopath who will end up becoming a serial killer, which is ridiculous, because I have trouble killing even spiders. It's all a product of your OCD or your anxiety and is not reflective of you. It's important to remember you are NOT your thoughts. Intrusive thoughts happen to everyone, and what separates you from actual monstrosities is that you recognise these thoughts and choose not to act on them, because you know they're wrong. I recommend checking out /r/meditation if it's something you'd be interested in trying, and also maybe talking to a mental health professional if you have the means. "
"OP I believe I’m going through something very similar. Ive had depression and anxiety for about 10 years and more recently an ADHD diagnosis. Been on different meds like Prozac, lexapro, vyvanse, adderall. All in different combinations. I’m solely taking adderall right now and this seems to help the ADHD obviously but also the anxiety because it helps me focus on one thing and sort of slows down my rapid thoughts. What makes me question if it is bipolar II or not is that everything comes in waves, especially the depression. I can’t seem to figure out if the depression is more situational and triggered by different life events (most recently a break up and starting a new stressful job) or if I’m just alternating between these hypomanic/depressive states and I have been mistaking the hypomanic states for ADHD all along? It’s really hard to explain and understand and at the end of the day your best bet is talking to your doctor about it and possibly seeing a psychologist. Hope it all works out for you! I understand your struggles."
"You’re right about some therapists working wonders. I get pretty salty about the whole prospect of “healing” because....well just because I’m salty I guess. But I do often think about going back to some kind of therapist. I guess I’ve been hesitant because I’m trying to pay off debt and I’ve been in a pattern  for years of spending thousands on therapy of some sort right when I need to buckle down and control my spending and regretting the therapy because I end up feeling the same.

I’ve been involved in a recovery program for addiction for years and this year more than ever and it’s helped. I think having a framework of how to live  and a fellowship works wonders, but I freak out sometimes because I’ve only really started to attack this “stuff” seriously in the past few years and the reality is that it takes time and recovery includes many emotional and mental relapses.

I’m basically a raw nerve that is not allowed to shield myself with the things I used to use to numb the pain so I have regular freak outs. 

"
"Please shop around until you find someone that you feel more comfortable with. It’s taken me years to find a psychiatric team that I’m happy with, and that includes a doctor who I pay out of pocket for because there are no providers that take my insurance. 

Unfortunately, getting help for your mental illness can be a double edged sword. It is SO HARD to be proactive and ask for help and set up those appointments and then to go through all that just to find out the doctor sucks. It’s like just when you think you’re making progress you get knocked down a peg and you’re back to square one. Combined with the apathy of depression and feelings of anxiety, it can feel impossible to even consider having to start the process over again. But there are good doctors and providers out there who want to help you and who will have a completely different treatment style. As others have mentioned, once you find the right therapist you can start to form a strong bond and you will naturally progress with your treatment. 

My best advice is to advocate for yourself as much as possible. No one else can do it for you. Tell your parents you are unhappy with this therapist. You deserve proper care and sometimes that means trying multiple doctors before finding the right fit. 

Good luck friend ❤️

"People sometimes make consent overly complicated.  But in your case, I can completely understand why you feel violated.  In the example you gave about the guy you hooked up with, here are my thoughts: 

1. Choking, covering mouth(as to deprive air, or restrict one's ability to talk), and anal, are all sexual acts in my opinion require separate consent than just consenting to have sex with someone.  Those three acts are more ""fetish"" acts (which are perfect fine for consenting adults), but require someone to ask if the other person is into it.   So you consented to have sex, but you did not consent to be choked, or any of the other things you listed.  He crossed the line.  Sex, and sexual acts without consent is assault at a minimum.  
2. I am not sure if you are saying that his roommate was in the room when it was happening OR if he was in a different room and was aware of what was happening, so I need some clarification on that.  

In reference to your dad: 

You are absolutely correct to feel violated here.  Sure the borderline weird stuff is weird.  But in the specific instance where you he did something to you and you told him that it made you uncomfortable, and he continued to do it anyways, to me at the very least tells me he was meeting his needs (whatever they were) and not worried about how his meeting those needs affected you.  Also, the neck kisses and the game ""get out"" to me seemed like grooming you for something more, and was definitely inappropriate.  

&amp;#x200B;

So knowing these things, you come to a crossroads.  In reference the the guy, how does knowing/reaffirming what you already know, change how you see the situation, or how you should move forward?  

&amp;#x200B;

In reference to your dad, has your dynamic changed, does he still make you feel uncomfortable?  How does this change your relationship with him, and what do you do with this knowledge moving forward?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here if you want to talk about it.  I was sexually assaulted when I was in college and I remember how ""off"" I felt, and how confused I felt.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: You are correct to feel violated, and no one has the right to tell you that you shouldn't feel the way you feel.  Something in those experiences raised red flags with you, and sometimes you just have to trust your gut instincts.  "

that’s terrible advice dude

"Be honest with your doctor; I told my doctor I was scared of going back and he gave me loads of time. If you’re on work leave, it can always be extended or you can find another job. One interview isn’t the end of the world, trust me, I know the feeling. I hope you feel better soon!"
Either find a way of contacting through social media even if it was a new account or try to catch them at home if you genuinely feel this bad about how things ended you should try and get some closure from them at least maybe they even do end up having a chat with you and forgive you.
"Have you seen more than one person? Tried more than one approach? Cognitive behavahioral seems to work for many people, family systems, mindfulness, jungian, solution-focused-- there are many approaches as there are many types of people who need therapy. Keep searching until it clicks."
I don’t even know you but I truly appreciate you taking the time to write this. It means a lot to me and I have reread it over and over again. Thank you so much! I called about my health coverage and I have an affordable copay so I’m definitely going to seek out professional help.
"I feel you. I've just graduated this year from a degree I thought I wanted until I was actually here and it was too late.

While it feels like it won't end; it absolutely will. 8 don't know your story but try to get whatever help you can and give it your best shot. It'll be over soon. "
"I looked online based on therapists that were in my network, in my area, that were taking new clients, their availability, the diagnoses they specialize in, what type of therapies they do, etc. And then I called the remaining ones and spoke to them on the phone to get a feel for each. "
"I meditate on the train to work.

Headphones in. Relaxing piano music on. Eyes closed and breathe in time with the music. Helps me quiet and clear my overactive mind.

"I suggest you to see a therapist or talk to someone you can trust about what you feeling. Don’t hold in everything with yourself, only professionals can diagnose your symptoms. 

Edit: your are not being dramatic, these are your emotions but definitely get your mental health check ! "
If I told you I'm a doctor why would it matter? If I told you I actually get paid to sit around and come up with crazy ideas for things . Why would it matter. I make 15$ doing something very easy and simple and I love my job I'll tell ya that . You dont need to know where I work creep
"If you're in the US, this is likely to be a self-limiting problem. There are downsides to prescribing treatment based on what's most cost-effective, of course, but one side effect of that approach is that long involuntary hospitalizations are rare, because hospitalization is expensive."
"This could easily backfire. He may be doing a terrible job of putting out feelers to see if non-monogamy is an option (although from the description he sounds more like a selfish jerk, to be honest), and if OP isn't interested in such a thing, pretending they are could really go wrong."
"they say repressed memories happen because the brain has to protect you (itself) and that when it feels you are safe enough and stable enough to see them, they will start to reappear. so traditionally this only really happens in the context of heavy therapy or miraculous maturation lol"
"I've struggled with self-hate throughout most of my life. I've always been my own worst enemy. And I often take pleasure in sabotaging my own life. I've self-harmed before in the past and I've found other ways to hurt myself too.

I've never had the urges that you currently have right now. But I can relate to the whole self-punishment thing. Unfortunately, I can't really give you any specific condition. You need to see a doctor. And you need to get properly diagnosed. If you don't do this now, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."
"Paranoia and anxiety do kinda go together if you think about.  Anxiety, like in the GAD (generalized anxiety) type, a person is essentially worried.  Paranoia generally presents as distrust/suspiciousness, preoccupation about others trustworthiness, reluctance to confide in others, finding hidden meaning in messages that are benign, misperceiving attacks against reputation/character, etc.  So they are similar, but not so similar.  I would say it's a given that someone who is paranoid is also anxious.  

Happy to help in any way!  :)    "
"Slow deep breaths almost absolutely will make an impact for you, set aside 10 minutes and then breath in deeply, hold and then breath out all of which in a slow fashion.   
Secondly, your illness could be a hormonal issue like testosterone, you could then practice deep breathing in a cold shower. This is so much more powerful than any meditation or breathing exercise, because you are affecting your body in multiple ways. Start small and work your way up to 3 minutes.   
Legit the best thing that happend for my anxiety was cold showers. "
"Thank you wasabicupcakes. It isn't common bc a lot of people my age and even younger adults won't admit it and won't seek treatment. Kids get caught, and some adults who become reckless and therefore that is all the statistics sees. I will be seeing my Psych soon, but I won't even get dx properly because there is such a lack of understanding of this...and lack of data on it (for someone my age).

I hate that word.

It makes my stomach hurt everytime I see it...I wonder what that means? I get a sinking feeling in my heart and stomach. :("
"YES!!! When I was at my worst (I had just attempted suicide twice and had been hospitalized twice) I depended on my earbuds and Pandora Radio to keep me from attempting again once I got home. I told my husband ""I am not ignoring you, but this is the only way to keep those thoughts from coming back..."" and he understood that. Thank goodness. I STILL listen to music to fall asleep every single night, and whenever I go anywhere in public--yep. Need my earbuds. I hate going out in public. I feel ya! I know exactly what you're talking about!"
Yeah. This has happened to me. The one Psychiatrist I had gone to a long time ago had a script fetish or something because he didn't even listen to me (nodded going uh huh...uh huh...) and then wrote me a prescription for antidepressants just like that. The Psych I have now is much better and asks if I would like to try some meds. I will be probably asked when I see her in about 3 weeks because of a new diagnosis. You can tell her that you aren't comfortable taking medications yet and would like to try other things first. :) Good luck!!
"You're doing the right thing. It must be so hard to get out of such an emotionally abusive relationship and toxic environment but no human being should belittle another, especially the one they claim to love, over their emotional wellbeing. You know he was wrong to react like that and that you're doing the right thing even though it's hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Glad to see you think things will be okay in the end- and they will. Keep your chin up and know you got out of an abusive relationship and survived and are here to fight another day! "
"I am so sorry. That really hurts. I have gone through it, though the break-up never did happen. My husband is not supportive in the least when it comes to my mental illnesses, and he has threatened to leave me at the Psych hospital (refused to come get me at first) and also take the kids and leave me, but he never does. It hurts like a mofo and I can definitely empathize with you. He tells me I am ""too broken"" for him to deal with everytime he gets pissed off at me. I am going through some REALLY bad stuff right now (that would probably get me in trouble if I let it run wild) and I have to keep it on the down low because he can't know anything about it. :( Yeah. I gotchya. Hang in there. There HAS to be someone out there who will love you for YOU, not your mental illness. \*\*BIG HUG\*\*"
"No problem at all. I had a hard time admitting my problem and my mind still shuts down when I think about it too much. 

I am a (diagnosed) fire-starter, obsessed with fire to the point that it is all I think about 24/7. I start small, controlled fires constantly throughout the day or my mind will literally go crazy and make me do it anyhow. I can resist to a point, but eventually I have to get rid of the stress/anxiety. I feel better once I light a fire, or if I even see one on YouTube or in my mind (I visualize a lot when the urges aren't too bad). It is stressful and scary, and I hate living with this stupid thing in my head all the time, but I will keep swimmin' too. Hopefully I will hear from the Counseling Center soon...I am on a waiting list for a Therapist. Message me anytime Ok?"
"The decisionsn your parents made are not your burden to bear. The only reason why they feel you should do that is because they they never had the chance to pursue their dreams. Instead, they compromised time and again, and (as your mother explicitly stated) ""figured things out"", which is really just a nicer way of saying ""never had the capacity to pursue their dreams, and have never known that sense fulfillment"".

Move out. Switch to part time status at school. Do what you need to and take as much time as you need. It might also be worth sitting down and saying ""I have figured it out, and I hoped you would want to be a part of it. But if you'd rather I do it on my from now on, I understand. Thank you for helping me out this long."" The phrasing she uses makes it seem like she's trying to manipulate you (she may not even be aware of it), and the fact that you felt the need to tell strangers that you know how lucky you are to be living rent free seems like you've reached a point of feeling guilty about it.

Also: https://youtu.be/iKHTawgyKWQ"
"It doesn't really work for me either. 

If I'm anxious and in a situation where I feel unsafe, it doesn't work. 

When I'm at home, or at ease, or in a place I feel safe, then it works fine and it's fairly easy to switch to that mode. But I don't need it at those times! At those times, I am ALREADY relaxed (or getting that way). 

I've been practicing it for years because I know it's *supposed* to help. It certainly doesn't hurt, so I don't mind continuing with it, but it also isn't helpful at all. Maybe one day I'll have a miraculous breakthrough ... but I think it's more likely that it just ***doesn't work***. 

The most useful thing it does for me is to help me calm down faster once I find somewhere I feel safe. However, at that point, I'm already out of the situation and so it's... not really necessary anymore. It is somewhat useful but I think the way some people say it's THE only way is very misleading. 

The thing that works best for me is just starting small and working my way up, and taking lots of breaks to rest somewhere I feel safe. Then gradually increasing how long I spend doing something that makes me feel more anxious, and gradually doing things of increasing difficulty when I feel ready. It's very very slow progress, but it does seem to be working (when I can actually do it - there are a lot of external pressures that make it hard to progress steadily, because sometimes I HAVE to do something that I'm not ready for because life requires it to be done. That usually sets me back a bit, but I'm still making progress overall.) "
"I think your symptoms definitely align with anxiety and depression. People often describe depression as a numbness.

When I was having anxiety, I was fatigued all the time. Anxiety can really sap your energy. I would actually recommend you see a therapist. They might be able to help you relieve some of your anxiety regarding this chronic fatigue issue. Tbh I think that anyone who is having new health problems should see a therapist to help them manage the worries that come along with poor health. Mental health can have such a big impact on physical health! Just the extra cortisol that's pumping through your body all the time from being anxious can cause issues.

I see SSRIs and SNRIs as short term fixes that allow your anxiety to ease up for a little while so you can focus on learning coping strategies. I took an SNRI for that exact reason (it took me 6 weeks before I felt the effects of it) and now I'm weaning off of it. I'm glad that it gave me some room to breath, see a therapist, and learn how to meditate and practice meditating regularly.

You might also look into adaptogens. I've started taking Ashwagandha as a supplement to support my adrenal system. It's supposed to help your body regulate cortisol (which mine definitely needed after having continuous anxiety for 10 months). It's also supposed to help with energy and sleep and stuff. Look into it and see if it's right for you.

My main recommendations that helped me are meditation, therapy, a book called Lost Connections by Johann Hari, and an article called The Change Triangle by Hilary Jacobs Hendel (it's on her website).

(Also, I'm really proud of an instagram I just started to talk about anxiety and depression @ouranimalbrains. I don't make money off of it or anything, check it out if you're interested.)

I hope you feel better!"

"Borderline is also a personality disorder, which essentially means it is the result of some sort of negative event or events that happened during a person's upbringing. Bipolar is a biological disorder, so it is hereditary and based in biological aspects rather than environmental ones. "
I behave similarly and have a similar past. Thank you for the post and the answers. I'm going to bring this up with my therapist. Any advice on how to brighten this up with my therapist though? I feel it might not go well if I bring a diagnosis to him than having him diagnose something.
"I don’t understand?

Maybe I should explain better.

I’m not talking of when you imagine the world in your head. 

I want to know how you feel when you go outside your door and see the world. I see shit and immediately get depressed, wishing I would be dead. The world is so useless."
"I talk like this quite often. I never considered this scenario though and now I’m interested, I always felt like I wasn’t real which is a bit different. I always feel like someone’s watching though, and listening. At times it makes me feel less alone, mostly it makes me paranoid. "
I was pretty much a mute my entire childhood until after I graduated high school. I would recommend group therapy. And I only say that because it'll force you to be around other people. The only way you'll ever overcome your social anxiety is by forcing yourself into social situations.
I'm so sorry to hear about your dad dude.  :(  Your mom is probably really hurting right now and she's taking it out on you.  It's not fair that you end up being the scapegoat.  Maybe you can have a serious discussion with her about how her behavior is effecting you.  Good luck!!  &lt;3
I've only ever seen mindfulness recommended so I found your comment particularly interesting.  Do you mind elaborating?  Does anyone else have bad things to say about mindfulness?  Personally it's something I've been encouraged to try and don't feel strongly about one way or the other.
"Just wanted to say you're incredibly well spoken. Thanks, did not even consider myself to have ptsd or have symptoms. I guess knowing some of these things you have just told me made me feel better. Hopefully I can revert to not being so paranoid and having hyper awareness. Thanks again."
"Oh I totally agree. Everyone needs to be more mature about this. I just know from past experience that guys like this will act childishly and then when you get sick of it and retaliate in kind, they call you out and use that as ammunition. I was always falling into that trap with my ex."
"Ouch. Yes, that is it. I have to be ""officially"" diagnosed still, but how the heck can it NOT be that? I think it is obvious, and my friend actually told me straight up that I am a pyromaniac and to just accept it...yikes. She has experience in Psychology so she is a very direct person."
"That sounds terrifying, I'm so sorry you are going through this. Have your tried therapy along with your meds? I would definitely give it a try, because it sounds like this severe anxiety and PTSD is messing with your personal, social, and possibly work life. I wish you the best of luck"
"We all love you, I love the fine details that make up your story. You always have a friend that you can message anytime ill respond usually right away. As you can tell by my post history, we could relate on a few things here and there. Maybe make some progress in our roads to happiness?"
Yeah there are multiple things people hallucinate. The only time that you hear about it is because it’s in the news or something and then the people that are hallucinating hurt themselves or others but the people that hallucinate pleasant things stay out of the news and the hospitals
"I wouldn’t be surprised if taking vitamins would help me, I have an awful diet. I exercise an ok amount, about 1 hour a day of weightlifting and also some stretches, but I probably need to do more cardio. I drink about 1 1/2 liters of water each day, which is about 1/3 if what I need daily I think..... so not good. If I could ever stop being so scared of nothing than I could y’all to a doctor and get all this figured out, but every time I try to everything in my head screams no and before I know it my body is walking away from help. "
"It's hard as hell and takes a tonne of practice. Have you tried taking up yoga or adding meditation of some kind to your bedtime routine? I find it's a lot easier to clear my mind or at least slow it down when I have something to focus on other than trying to focus on nothing. 

I've been working on it for over a year at the encouragement of my therapist and I'm still not ""good"" at it but I've gotten better and I've found that yoga really helps. Tbh it never really ""works"" in terms of totally quietting my brain but it does slow it down. "
"Thanks so much for your comment, I’m safe for now, though he has told me he’ll get me one day which I do believe. He waits and watches and then strikes, and never forgets. It wasn’t just me he was violent with, he recently avoided jail for an unprovoked attack on a civilian. 

Thanks for the insight too, and I’m glad your sister is doing well now. 

I have thought personality disorder, or even some scale of psychotic disorder, he has so many symptoms of different illnesses he is just one complex individual, I’m glad I got away."
"There’s not a lot you can do on an anonymous forum. Report any direct threats/harassment. Anyone this user is following around can block them so they no longer see his/her posts. If you have actual identifying information on this person, and they have made concrete threats against themselves or others, you could call law enforcement in their area to do a welfare check, but it seems unlikely that they have given you that info. Other than that, you can suggest to them that they seek professional help, although they may not respond well. "
"They're not *supposed* to if you're not an immediate risk to yourself or anyone else.  However, it's always possible that they're idea of what puts you at imminent risk is different from yours.  Or they could be an ass.  Or you could get frustrated and say something in anger that they interpret as putting you in imminent risk.

There is always a chance that calling a hotline will get the cops sicced on you.  It's happened to me, which is why I won't ever call them again, but I'm apparently in the minority.

Good luck whatever you do, OP."
"Who says you have to fit the mold of either group? My old roommate is homosexual and asian, and i'm hispanic and masculine as heck by societal standards. I'm going to be his best man in a couple months. We never cared about our identities, just that we liked hanging out together.

If possible I would recommend just finding positive people. If not that find things you know you enjoy or try something that interests you. I was a hopeless 21 year old who started following his interests, and before I knew it, I found community and confidence."
"Yeah, that's true. I've let 2 of my friends know what's happening, since the three of us talk a fair amount. One I've friends with for the last 10 years, and his girlfriend I've known a shorter amount or time. We talk through fb video chat as they're in Canada (he went to see her). They're the closest friends I've had, and my my mum doesn't want me to be friends with him, because she hates him, and probably because he's helped me out a lot in the last 10 years...
It's difficult to see a psychologist as it's pretty expensive to see one..."
"You should ask about the THERAPY as much as the therapist.  Different therapies are effective for different issues and I doubt that there is a single therapist in the world that knows and has experience with all of the therapies.

One of the BEST therapists that I ever saw... I saw her for precisely two sessions.  She recognized my issues very quickly, realized what therapy I needed, and referred me to a different therapist.  Ten months later... I am doing MUCH MUCH MUCH better, all because I started doing a therapy that was best for me."
"No problem. Just saying a therapist can help you get over it but they can’t bring back the memories. They say Most people who end up remembering actually made it up in there head. So if you go to one don’t expect him/her to make you remember. The reason you won’t remember is because your brain blocked it out for a reason. The trauma was to strong for your brain to understand and deal with. It isn’t likely your brain will say i can handle this now and recall the memory. 

The best you can do is see a therapist and ask them how to get over it.

"I had a major major major major, depessive episode accompanied with extreme panic/anxiety and potentially some dissociation one time (I cannot stress how fucking insane it was).  I've never been able to get actual word on what exactly the whole thing was, but I do know that when it was over that it took over a year for my memory to begin working properly again, and for me to just feel ""like myself"" in a very vague, general sense.

So yes it can, and some residual effects can apply past the depression, but the good thing is you don't notice them because you're just so relieved to be feeling better.  It's only in retrospect, once you're back to 100%, that you realize you weren't at 100% yet.

And for the record, I do still struggle with depression, but it's much less severe (still pretty bad sometimes though) and comes in waves, so I've luckily retained my cognition/memory (knock on wood).  I've done a lot of introspecting, and work hard not to go back to that insane place I was in because I know I won't make it out if I have to do it again."
"1. I have been to many therapists and I spilled my heart and told them all about my problems and how much I suffer and they just sat there and looked sympathetic. That's why I don't believe in long term effects from therapy. 2. After I came home I was feeling shame all the time. I would lay in my bed and try to sleep and all i could see when I closed my eyes are the horrible things I've done and feel face warming shame and guilt. This slowly got better as time went on but now I try to think back to those things I did and re live them and I don't feel bad for me of the person I was abusing... I just don't feel anything im not even pissed with people I'm never really angry I don't really think what I say Its just the social norms I remember following when was still afraid of going back. 3. The drug use was quite bad I would take Xanax twice a day take oxy and MD and snort pills and of course smoke all day. I didn't ""enjoy it"" I wasn't prtying I was just depressed and ""self medicating"". Now these fucking drug tests I can't even smoke on the weekends. For a while I was drinking alot but it doesn't affect your mind only your body and I liked tripping out for hours. I like shrooms a lot. I'm just typing this out with no reason because it feels a little bit relieving. Not good but... a bit better."
"I don't know if this will help because I don't know everything about you, but I want to share my experience with you. Maybe we could have a fair amount in similar.

I got away with a lot as a kid. I found shortcuts and ways of covering my ass to stay out of trouble. I never practiced to make perfect. If I failed, I knew how to spin things into blaming others. I also had a lot of close friends back then, and we exchanged a lot of gifts.

I'm 23 now. I have no close friends. I got too comfortable not caring about my friendless/unproductive life for most of my day, but at night, I would cry and think of how worthless I am.

A lot changed in the past month for me. I tossed out/ donated 60% of my clothes and maybe 97% of memorabilia/sentimental items (two whole recycle bins' worth). As I cleansed my crowded ecosystem, I noticed most of what I hoarded were things like gifts, birthday cards, or notes from people not in my life anymore.

 I think it's because surrounding myself with these things revalidated my worth to myself.

I held onto the past too much. Getting rid of all the things I owned before today didn't give me anything from my past to ruminate on/reassure to me that I was okay... because I was far from being okay.

So now I validate myself on what I can accomplish today, for my future."
"Please don’t idealize suicide. It is not the answer. I know it seems like there is no light at the end of the tunnel but there is. If therapy is not working see a different psychologist. I saw 3 until I found the right one. You need to see a psychiatrist as well. Ask for genetic testing. It blows me away that more that half of psychiatrist don’t do this. You could be suffering from other health conditions that can worsen your depression like I was. I was hypothyroid and didn’t produce a certain enzyme that the brain uses. I now take medication for both of these on top of anti depressants. This will also tell you which drugs you can break down properly. I was on a anti depressants that didn’t work for me all my life until I did this. They didn’t make me depressed but they just made me like a zombie. This ended up making me feel like I could never be happy. Please also exercise, it is amazing how much this can make a difference. There was a study that showed exercise can make a bigger impact on your mental health than Zoloft. Also try to live a healthier lifestyle, stop any drugs, alcohol, porn, and junk food. This seems hard right now and like too much work I know. Start of little and build up to it. #1 see a psychiatrist and get genetic testing done. After I started doing all this stuff I never felt better in my life. Of course I am still working on myself and still fighting so I don’t go back to the way I was and can get even better. If you have any questions regarding my experience or concerns please feel free to message me.

"Suffered from depression and possible borderline personality disorder for 7 years. I recovered and lead a healthy happy life now.

With some therapy you can start setting healthy brain habits and coping mechanisms. But when things bother me personally, I write them down and set a personal plan for myself on how I'm going to get myself through whatever I'm going through. It's been proven that when you write things out it really helps you heal.

If grad school isn't for you that's fine, however, I don't think by leaving grad school you will feel better. Youve already explained that this is something youve been struggling with for a while. Unless you know this career path is not for you, your depression could be leading you down self-destructive paths. Postponing is never a terrible idea, caring for your mental health is definitely healthy, and something that should take priority over a career. But I think you should put real, hard thought and contemplation into quitting completely. Speak to a counselor, then maybe speak to your advisor, be open and honest and if they can't be understanding then they are terrible fucking people anyways.

You can do this! Part of depression is feeling like everything is overwhelming. But take pride in your small steps. Motherfucker you brushed your teeth today? Got out of bed? That shit is fucking hard! I can't speak for your other anxieties but I know that shit is hard to do on a regular day, so be proud of those things that seem mundane but are actual victories and take it one day at a time.

I believe in you."
"I think you should go to NA regardless. 

I've had trouble with AA meetings that talk about a higher power. But they don't use the term ""God""

And there are definitely a decent chunk of atheists at these AA meetings. Basically, the ""higher power"" doesn't have to be God if you don't believe in God (which I don't believe in, either). It is just about accepting the fact that you as an individual are such a small part of the universe, and there are a trillion things you can't control. 

I mostly study biology, so I don't know much about astronomy or the cosmos. But I do know what our solar system is a very small part of our galaxy which is a very small part of our supercluster of galaxies, and our supercluster of galaxies is a very small part of the universe as a whole. If God did exist, I can't imagine why he would never take notice of a single human individual. The birth and death of a single human would be like a flash in the dark to Him. 

We live on a crowded planet, which is a blessing to people who thrive on social interaction. But it is a curse when almost everyone you've ever encountered has hurt you or failed to help you. 

I personally think that we all live this one life, and it is important to be happy in this one life. There is no reason why the actions of others should make you unhappy. After surviving what you have been through, you should realize that someone being rude to you on the subway is so insignificant that you shouldn't even think about it. 

I think that antidepressants should help. They are not narcotic, so no psychiatrist should have any problem prescribing you antidepressants even if they believe that you used to do meth. Antidepressants won't make anything better right away. I've had to take my antidepressants religiously for almost two months before I had any effect, and even that effect barely made me feel any better, so I had to increase my dose and wait another two months before I felt the effect of that increased dose. I had to increase my dose another time, wait longer, and then add a second drug . . . and finally I started to function at a level that was adequate for the life I want to live. Everyone online will tell you that these drugs don't work, because no one has the patience to go through this long process. 

For me, my ""higher power"" is the knowledge that everything is just random chance. There is no intelligent design in the universe, it all just happens randomly. So you can't control the way people treat you and you can't control what you've already been through, but you can control how you feel and what you do in the present. Every time I quit drugs in the past, I always felt the need to go back because ""my life still sucks when I'm sober"" so why even bother to be clean? Well, I eventually quit for good, and I realized that I'm happier when I have the freedom to do what I want, without being a slave to addiction. I'm happier when I can spend the fifty bucks in my pocket on literally anything . . . instead of spending it all on drugs that get me high for twenty minutes and make me miserable for weeks.

"Anxiety isn't 'mentally unstable.' It's a really common thing, but it sounds like yours is a little severe. Does your school have a counseling center? Why don't you reach out to them. They can help you with your issues with attendance (both with the school administrators and personally)."
Don't act like you're trying to defeat the stigma around Autism by perpetuating the worst parts of said stigma. You don't get to try and cast yourself as some noble hero trying to save high functioning people on the spectrum from ostracization while actively hating other autistic people.

"The thing is that I went to them specifically BECAUSE I was feeling actively suicidal. They still did nothing but offer me the respite program, which I can’t do because of my seizures. I’ll be starting DBT group soon, so hopefully that will help and I won’t have to see them again. "

"I do understand that there's no actual need to take being asked ""how are you,"" so personally.

Though for people who are having a hard time with their mental health to begin with, there's just a heightened sensitivity when being asked this question, even when recognizing it's just part of casual conversation. It just makes someone who's already struggling with depression feel put on the spot (more than it should) if that makes sense.

Edit:// I'm trying to work on not taking it personally though. I know it's just meant as common courtesy."
"None of us are douches up in here. It’s a supportive community and whatever it is you’re going, many of us are so you’re not alone :)

"The biggest thing you need to work on this- Stop worrying about what other people think of you. Yes, I know it's easier said than done. And yes, I know what it feels like to crave constant reassurance. But I can tell you from my own personal experience that if you don't start putting yourself first, you'll always be miserable.

If you're constantly needing reassurance or acting needy, then you probably will come across as annoying. Just take a step back and realize that your needs come first. Focus on yourself and learn to be alone. Learn to find ways to make you happy by yourself. And most importantly, learn to love yourself. If you can't love yourself, then how can you expect anybody to love you back. 

If you really need somebody to talk to, just send me a message. So keep that in mind."
"You can bring it up to her. She won't commit you or anything (at least in my experience) unless you are a clear danger to yourself or others. I tried to hang myself and had marks on my neck and my face had small purple blotches all over it...so when she'd seen me, yeah, she sent me right to the psych hospital. I was a danger to myself. I wanted to die (at that time...not now!) so she was right. I have an issue I have to bring up with my Psych also, so I can relate to your fear. My issue just might get me committed again, though I don't actively want to hurt anyone, nor myself. I hope you can figure out how to tell her. She might be able to explain why it happened, and there might just be a genetic link there considering your family history. Good luck! Let us know how that appointment goes!"
"You're not overreacting but you're strongly reacting to a difficult situation which is exactly what is expected to happen in this context anyway. 

It's normal (or *not abnormal*) to find yourself struggling when starting therapy because therapy is difficult. For some people the difficult part of therapy is the therapist.

It's up to you to think back and ask yourself if you're reacting normally to a difficult situation which will get better soon, or if you really can't connect to that person. 

Not to be all pragmatic but you could probably meet a lot of therapists and many of them will appear just the same, the fact that yours is 4 years older is quite anecdotical. If it was a successfully looking 45yo man you might have reacted the same way, just to something else than age specifically."
"Finding a therapist can be difficult, but how do you feel about the therapist? Do you like them? Do you feel comfortable with them? Would you feel comfortable telling them your darkest secrets? That's one of the most important things when going to see a therapist because they will be able to help you the best. Sometimes you have to try a few therapists to find the one that will work best for you. I always tell my clients that if they don't feel comfortable with me after a few sessions, they can go to someone else and I will do my best to find them someone who is a better fit.

The other thing to realize also is that CBT is a great therapuetic way to work through things, but it is in a way like a bandaid. It is something to get you through the first part and help you feel a little bit better while you work through the deeper, darker, more difficult things. That's why it goes back to feeling comfortable with your therapist. 

Life is rough, finding a therapist can be difficult, but finding the right one will help you get through your problems faster. Although therapy does take time. So you can try to wait it out with this therapist, but figure out if you feel like they are right for you. 

I hope this helps a little. If you need help finding a new therapist, let me know, I may be able to help."
"The fact that a doctor even can identify most problems based on a routine exam is pretty much a myth, especially when it comes to psychiatry.  All most doctors or psychiatrists do is make their best guess, give you meds, and how the meds effect your symptoms gives them some indicator as to whether their guess was right or if they have to make a new one.  Not the most reassuring information I’m giving you I bet but that’s pretty much how it works.  Problem is now that most insurance companies won’t pay for longer than a 15 minute appointment so that’s what the doctors do or else in many cases they’re essentially working for free.  One cover all for them though is that research shows that SSRI’s are pretty much the most effective for depression AND anxiety.  If they don’t work, doctors then generally look to see if there’s something else going on like ADHD, a mood disorder, psychosis that would require different meds.


I’m not saying it’s right, it’s just the way things are.  That’s why when it comes to using psych meds especially, most places won’t let you get psych meds unless you’re seeing a therapist for weekly 45 min-hour appts.  The therapist won’t be able to prescribe meds but generally good psychiatrists will take their recommendations into consideration."

yeah how do you want to reach me?
Are you under the care of a psychiatrist and on medications? If not I would see one ASAP. No need to suffer needlessly. I have depression that has at times been so severe that it has caused paranoia and visual and auditory hallucinations. The antidepressant I take alleviates my suffering.
"Definitely. I think it’s called anhedonia. At first it’s a relief, but then it gets old. Some affect you more than others, it’s individual what works best for you. I found SNRIs worked best for me (cymbalta, Effexor), but they are a bugger to get off of, lots of withdrawal effects. "
"Here to remind you the depression won’t just go away you need to actively work on it with therapy and/or meds. The stress of a relationship is probably aggravating your depressive symptom. 

First step is to either book an apt with your family doctor or university counselling services. "
Hey there. I know that when you’re feeling suicidal it can be impossible to find anything good or worthwhile. Have you tried therapy? I know it isn’t a quick fix but seeing a trauma therapist really helped my suicidality. I hope that you’re able to find something bright soon. &lt;3
"Hiya. Your victory of seeking help is a huge deal to celebrate!

&gt;It’s not going to be easy because I find it hard to open up.

Would it be easier for you if I told you what to expect? I can copy and paste a list of the questions I've been asked at my own appointments, if you'd like."
"I laughed too hard at this. 

I was writing in my journal one time after I had started to feel depressed again and I believe my line was something similar to: “I think I’ll stay here a while and just let this feeling take over, because at least it’s familiar and I understand it.” "
"I think in Youtube videos. Every thought is like having a youtuber commentate on my life and I am with them to give insight to the situation. I sound like a lunatic when I descibe it, but the GameGrumps have been debating this comment for some time now and I thinks it's time to share now."
"I think it's all in your delivery to others. Instead of saying ""I'm a pyromaniac"", say ""I like fire"". To people uneducated in mental health conditions, that's far easier for them to understand and not stigmatize.

Edit: If I knew you IRL, I would think it's cool, definitely not freak out."
My family is very damaged right now. My aunt got Baker acted and has been moving from hospital to hospital. My parents are busy trying to find work for themselves since my father go laid off. I can't really rely on them to divert attention away from what they are dealing with themselves.
"Stopping and starting will also have a negative effect - at least it did for me with citalopram. Give it a bit longer and if you don’t feel better, go back to your doctor. I tried a few different SSRIs before settling with fluoxetine and I’ve never experienced any problems with that. "
Those are two of my diagnoses too :). I hope getting diagnosed was at least somewhat validating for you. I’ve actually never heard of Paxil before I’m assuming it’s an SSRI?  I really hope it helps. Do you have a follow up with the doctor to monitor your progress on the medication?
You should research Borderline personality disorder and affective disorders and then see a therapist. Its important to research first because it helps you discover symptoms you never realized you had and makes it less likely that you can be misdiagnosed. Recovery is hard but its possible.
"not sure why you’re spamming me, it’s the OP call, i was giving an unbiased general view, if she’s okay then cool if not get help. but either way you can’t force someone to get help, so even if the post is screaming at you, it’s the person in question who has decisions to make. "
"Ah, fair enough then. Just what it sounded like from you saying it was from looking at their posts alone. Seems definitely stranger to me in that setting, though I think you could have clarified better it's not just posting on reddit.  

I imagine like you say, a lot of factors go into it, and that insecurity might be a big part, as well as how being clear about self-diagnosis may make them feel their issues won't be taken seriously when they may be in a bad place and in need of support (regardless of if the label they use might be wrong)."
"Hey bud. I'm 30 and this still bothers me from time to time. It definitely gets easier after you leave education.

It's not something you'll really come to deal with until you realise that we all do it - yourself most definitely included. It's a simple fact of life that some people take greater priority over others.

Try to remember that you don't owe them anything, nor they you. Show those you care about kindness, generosity and loyalty. It won't take too long before some of that positivity you put out find it's way back to you.

Chin up."
"Hey, thanks again for the response. I totally understand where you're coming from with a lot of your post; I feel bored often and it's difficult to get me excited. 

I've been finding myself overeating and snacking a lot for a while, but I do not oversleep. If anything, I sleep too late resulting in a lack of sleep.

I do feel okay though. I wouldn't say that I'm completely dissatisfied with how things are going but they could definitely be better. 

If anybody reading this has anything to contribute, I'd love to hear what you have to say."
"I get that. But don't worry, you'll be welcomed and find support in any of those subs! I also have multiple diagnoses, but I mainly post in the BPD sub because that's the diagnosis that I most closely identify with at the moment. But I'll post in different subs if I feel like the content of what I'm posting is more identifiable elsewhere. Either way, lots of people have several different diagnoses in each of those subs, so don't let that discourage you. Heck, you could even post in one and link your post in other subs if you felt like it. "
"I spent some time in Broughton and John Umstead in North Carolina. They were both highly professional and well managed. The wierd thing was that Broughton Hospital looks like an asylum from a horror movie, yet made me feel a lot more comfortable that the more professional looking facility that John Umstead had. It kinda felt like a prison, whereas Broughton felt like almost a vacation. They have an extensive library, comfy living area to watch movies, we even went fishing *at the facility*.  John Umstead had that cold hospital feel to it. "
"I wish I could hug you. Honestly I’m a huge sweetheart and have too much love to give, but this junk clouds me up too badly to show it or give it to people. Hopefully I can get this all better and show people I’m more than just the quite kid. 

I’m feeling good again now. My appetite is back, so I’m in bed (it’s 11:15pm here, so it’s actually ok for me to be in bed lol)  watching the office and eating popcorn. I’ll probably take you up on that offer, so you might want to get some headache medicine prepared. Thank you so much "
"It kind of sounds like mild symptoms of Aspergers. My brother had that and experienced some of the same symptoms. He is now fully functional and though he doesnt deal well with drama, he is normal. 


It could also just be your age and the normal anxiety that comes along with the constant changes in your life. You get anxious when sound changes too quickly to being loud, similar to how you have rapid changes throughout elementary school. 


Another thing, which i think is probably the case, is sensory overload and overactive imagination. You get overwhelmed by sound, light, etc. and at the same time have an imagination that goes into overload at night because there is no stimulation. So your mind creates the stimulation. Could be because of a hectic household or school. 


Hope this helps. "
"Here’s my little slice of advice that stems from my experience of dealing with anxiety issues my whole life. You can’t fight or battle it. You have to submit to it and recognize that it is nothing more than physical reactions and sensations in your body. The more you fight, the more adrenaline is produced.

I highly recommend this book. It helped me a great deal in learning how to treat my anxiety. It’s an older book, so some terminology is a little outdated, but it’s the most helpful anxiety treatment book I’ve ever read. The first half of the book has helped change my life. Here’s were you can find it if interested - https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Nerves-Claire-Weekes/dp/0451167228.

The other general advice is to train yourself to learn that “whatever happens, it will be OK, and mean it.” This is something that takes practice, but truly being ok with the worst case scenarios, even if they’re not in anyway ok, is freeing. The real idea being to not let what ifs to steal current or future happiness.

Best of luck to you."
"Mental health is an all consuming job if you want to recover, it's tough to work on your own and even tougher to deal with someone else's at the same time. I know, I've done it a couple of times and it hasn't worked out well for me.  I know it's terrifying but you need to concentrate on you just now. Maybe your girlfriend is trying to say she can't handle your situation as well as her own? This doesn't mean she doesn't love you but she loves herself more and is doing what's best for her in the longterm right now, as should you. If it's really meant to be it will still be there when you're both healthier, happier people and your relationship will have the best chance of going the distance. No matter how much you love each other you can't make each other better, that's some thing you do on your own and it takes time and energy. That's why there are professionals to help you, please contact one, work on you, be the best version of you, and your future girlfriend will be in a healthier and happier relationship because of it. Good luck, my dude. "
"This is common and normal. Sleep deprivation has been shown to increase short-term dopamine release. Although the research, so far as my knowledge goes, is not very clear on why this happens; it's safe to say that your body going into something akin to an emergency mode.

Like with any other bodily emergency functions, such as going into shock, sprinting, fight or flight response, etc, it's ok to rely on this every now and then, but _absolutely do not make this your default_. This is somewhat comparable to drinking lots and lots of coffee, you trade tomorrow's energy for a boost today. Which is fine if tomorrow is weekend, and you can chill, otherwise it is _not fine_, not resting when your body needs rest is baaaaddd.

I repeat, _absolutely do **not** make this your default sleeping pattern_. Sleeping is _insanely_ important for you, one or two days of some sleep deprivation is not much of a problem, much more than that and you can still feel the damage to your cognitive ability and energy next week.

Please for gods sake sleep, just sleep."
"Go check out your campus counseling center, or find a therapist off campus.

:? its  the  same thing  my bad.
Alright. Just message me whenever.
And you can’t get a job because?
Cheers lad. Thanks for helping out
Every mental comrade is my friend.
Good on you for sharing this &lt;3
Has anything big happened recently
Hey I’ll message you. Thank you.
I am seeing a therapist every week
I'm 30 now so between 15-20 years.
Only works if you can concentrate
Save the last bullet for yourself.
Seems clear cut ocd. See a doctor
Sounds a little like dissociation.
Thank you I could really use them.
That would be incredible honestly
That’s good to hear thank you:)
This is incredibly irresponsible.
"To start, but watch for addiction."

"What was your hobby?

&amp;#x200B;"
What's funny about trolling here?
Why do you feel it's never enough?
Why do you want to self diagnose?
Yeah that’s the whole diagnosis
Yes that is exactly how it feels !
Yes. Check out r/Narcissisticabuse
have you tried racial acceptance?
Awesome! :) I am so glad for you. How is that going? I bet living on your own is a wonderful (but also weird at times) experience. I have been on my own since I was 23 (I am 47 now) and it is STILL a surreal experience sometimes lol. Keep your head up and thank you for talking to me. &lt;3
Before I was medicated I would do this while alone and occasionaly by mistake I'd do it with someone around. Mostly I'd just grit my teeth and growl. Pretty cringy I guess but thats just what came out. Occasionally screaming into a pillow or just beating my head against a wall or the floor
"Do not mutilate yourself. Take all of your sharp objects/knives and lock them up somewhere where you can't have easy access to them. And then when you go see your therapist, you need to tell them exactly how you feel. That's the only way they can help you. You have to be completely honest."
"I agree with all of this. The only thing that I would add is that if there IS anyone out there who had had success without therapy and meds provided by someone licensed to do so, it’s probably because their anxiety was situational and the situation improved therefore so did the anxiety. "
"I want to do all of these things and I do try but they don’t tend to be enough or I don’t know how to do them correctly. I recently set up therapy appointments and on my first one they want to medicate me. I don’t want to be medicated, I want to do this on my own but is it possible? "
"I was misdiagnosed with BPD before correctly diagnosed with bipolar. 

I will say this - BPD is TREATABLE. You want the treatable one with therapy. You want the one that you can get over. You can no longer fit the diagnosis after therapy and feel better. 

Who the hell doesn’t want that?"

Im having ect i am noticing a difference in my depression and anxiety but i don't believe it's given just for anxiety. Its also helping my ed self harm and substance use but that's due to my depression bring lifted so i don't feel the need to engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms anymore.
"Natural deaths and murder. All in a few months. I’m terrified of anything happening again. Every time I thought it was over, nope, something happened again, out of nowhere. I have no reason to be worried but at the same time, I had none before either and horrible things still happened..."
"Self diagnosers are always really defensive when you question self diagnosing... 

This is not a club we don't want you to join. Please take my diagnosis. 

 I dont care what i am and am not diagnosed with. I just want to be healthy and so far following what my doctor has said has worked. "
"Thank you. I really appreciate that. It just sucks when it's people who are meant to be your best friends and you are there for them but they're never there for you.

I see my psychiatrist tomorrow but at the moment it feels like we haven't even scratched the surface of my issues just yet "
That may be what it is. There has been times where I've had intense chest pain out of random. But idk this was the weirdest and most intense it's been. I kept thinking of insults or calling the police. But now that I think of it that's kinda extreme. I kinda feel like I was losing my mind.
"That was a fascinating read. You also seem really responsible about safety. I bet as soon as you hang out with some friends a couple times you could bring up having an evening campfire, you could even tell them, “I love making campfires”, that is nothing to be ashamed of. Best of luck!"
"The people I was referring to told me about their social anxiety, or their child’s anxiety, in person. People online are just trying to get advice so it’s understandable. My annoyance is with people insinuating, “Well, THEY have social anxiety and look how well THEY’RE coping.”  "
"Therapists aren’t supposed to even say hello to you outside of their office unless you initiate the conversation first. It violates privacy and I believe HIPPA. That’s in the us at least. So while you may cross paths, you don’t have to acknowledge his presence if you don’t want to."
"Well counseling/therapy is definitely the right first step. But you'll have to tell them everything if you expect to ever get better. Until then, however, you need to hang tight and keep yourself distracted. Keep yourself busy until your appointment. And don't do anything dumb before then."
Yea. Don't feel ashamed or get discouraged if you have to try several different medical professionals before you succeed in dealing with whatever it is you need to work on. The human mind is a tricky thing so it can take several different approaches before you find one that works for you.
"you are enough. I find listening to podcasts and audiobooks really helpful to hear stories from people who feel the same makes me feel less alone. Check out mentalpod, thats pretty awesome. Also getting out in nature for a walk can help get a perspective. Its a journey but you will be ok x"
"Heh, thanks. I get that we all make mistakes, but unfortunately I keep telling myself I shouldn’t watch it, but I do. Like, I think it’s an addition I need to break? I watched porn a couple times a day, then I realized I have an issue.

But yeah, not for me. I tell myself not to watch it, and I do again... wondering what the heck I’m doing with my life, disappointed. I get that pornography has mixed opinions on being ‘good for you’, but watched everyday is not good. That’s likely how I got into the whole BDSM.

Anyway, thanks..."
"Oh wow. Can I ever relate to this. Not only to the self-harm part, but to the impulse part. I have strong ones...  


I used to self-harm, and it was tough to give it up. Basically I was forced to. I don't know exactly what you can do besides talk this out with someone professional because they have many more techniques to help you. Whatever you do I wish you the best of luck and the most love. If you need to talk, I am here. I have the same experiences so I can understand exactly how you feel. Stay strong and we are here if you need us. :)"
"You sound pretty lonely.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a lot of friends anymore myself.  I've got my ex-husband I still talk to and then I've got a friend in Scotland I talk to maybe once a week.  One thing you might try is calling a WARM line, they are basically chat lines for lonely people and they are free.  Another thing to try is going to watch a stream that has a chat box so you can type in it and talk to people.  Or hey, just post a bit more about yourself here so people can get to know you in a single post and reply.  

&amp;#x200B;"
"1. Look into mindfulness meditation practice. It is ironic because that is not about shutting your mind off but rather opening it up, yet it can help deal with anxiety anyway so you can sleep better. Many people find it helpful.

2. Employ good sleep hygiene. Go to sleep the same time every night if possible. Stay in a dark area before bed. Use bed only for sleep (or sex if applicable). Screens off an hour before bedtime. 

3. Don't fight insomnia. If you lay down and can't sleep after an hour, try getting up and doing light activity, like reading (paper not screen). Then try again. If you still can't sleep, lie down and rest with your eyes closed. This is not as good as sleep but is also restorative.

4. If you are seeing a therapist, discuss this. If you aren't seeing a therapist, see one."
"Hello! I was wondering if you have looked into art therapy at all? Art can be a good place to explore, process and sometimes gather your own insight through your creation under the professional guidance of a trained art therapist. Art therapy is not about art skill and the act of making art can have the ability to access memories and experiences that are sometimes locked deep down or feeling like they are in pieces. This can be the case in trauma experiences which is why art can be a great tool to potentially help you uncover and/or unite these disconnected pieces. Sources (Check out Savneet Talwar and Accessing traumatic memory through art making:An art therapy trauma protocol (ATTP) if you want to read a little about the possibilities) Best wishes towards your personal growth and healing. "
"Psych nurse here. Not everyone hallucinates bad stuff. I knew a refugee who wouldn't take their meds because that was the only way they could hear the voices of their family. Another would listen to and talk back to the angels. Got rightly offended when we offered to help take the angelic voices away. Some people with schizophrenia have some really cool delusions as well that we probably wouldn't care about if it wasn't affecting another aspect of their life or someone else's very negatively.

My guess, and this isn't backed up by any studies off the top of my head, but the nicer/less hurtful the hallucination is the less likely someone is to get help. No one is going to throw Barry in the back of the paddy wagon because he truly believes that aliens are sending him messages through the white noise on the television but if Barry is presenting to the emergency room in psychological agony because those aliens won't stop harassing him and he doesn't know what to do anymore then he'll be flagged as a patient in need of mental health intervention."
"Yeah, my brother was going through depression when he was my age and he didn't express it in a healthy way at all. He was mean to everyone and so he lost a lot of his friends, he never opened up to anyone at all except that one time when we were watching a movie and he randomly started to cry. I was also going through it then but now that I think of it, although I opened up quite late (I was too young to diagnose myself then), as a girl I did come out and I was given more sympathy and support than him because he didn't know how to talk about his feelings in a healthy way at all. My dad is a very manly sort of guy so whenever he broke down he would always get annoyed and irritated compared to whenever I broke down, and my mum was similar (my parents are a bit old fashioned). I was too young to see he was depressed back then, but I think this attitude of others towards his change just encouraged him further to not open up and talk to people about how he was feeling, and he didn't have any close friends he could talk either so that didn't help. "
"I can relate a lot to what u/genesismtnsandcoffee is experiencing but on a milder level. I thought it might be SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) because it's coming into winter and this is the second year in a row I've experienced the symptoms, but I also experience it during the summer just not as bad as winter. To try and answer your question with my experience, I have a lot of friends who smoke cannabis and I've taken a couple drags on 3 different occasions. They always feel the full effect, but I never do. I can't explain it other than, as if someone told me a good joke. And it'll only last 10 mins. It could very well be that I didn't smoke much but I find it strange.

The reason I'm here in the first place is because I'm also extremely tired and I just want to find the answer to why that is. Summer I can do a 36km cycle and the next day I'll be ok to do some more. Winter in the other hand, I can't even manage school. Walking up the stairs in school or moving from class to class my legs feel like they're going to collapse, I can't concentrate whatsoever in class either. I also feel completely dead or ""numb"" some days. Today I woke up and actually felt pretty good, but 3 hours later the tiredness started to hit me. I went to a funfair with some friends and felt really happy on some of the rides, but now 3 hours after that, I'm absolutely exhausted and feel an unexplainable sadness/loneliness coming over me. This isn't the first time either. Generally when I manage to come out of myself and have a good time, I come crashing back down after..."
All the more reason to work it out.
Don't worry about it. :) Good luck.
Good Luck in whatever you decide.

"Details of what you're experiencing would be helpful.  If you're doing trauma work, I think it's pretty normal.  Dredging up old feelings that have been buried, is a painful process.

If you're not clicking with your therapist, then find a new therapist.

It really is situational dependent."
"Do it. Don’t overthink your post, don’t type and then edit it before you post. Just get it all out there, post it, then check the spelling and edit the spelling/grammar alone. Once it’s out there, it forces you to deal with it rather than burying your head, which is what I usually do."
"I hear you.

Independence is an incredibly attractive attribute in guys and girls.

I made another post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9i2gks/i_used_to_be_going_places_now_im_the/) that explains my situation in more depth. Unfortunately I'm in a really difficult situation right now and I'm still trying to figure out what to do. I wish it was that easy.

"Nothings wrong with you at all. You're just aware that most people you meet don't give a fuck about you. (which they don't)

"That is such a great, beautiful accomplishment. It will be 7 years for me next month. It's always a weird day for me, but I try to do something to celebrate my life. Last year I got a cookies and cream milkshake.  I would recommend doing something to celebrate life, something small or big. "
"That sucks:( I think that the most fucked up thing about it is that they have the audacity to call that sub bpdlovedones, when it's clear that most of the people there hate people with BPD and have issues of their own that they need to sort out instead of blaming an entire group of people. "
"WellTrainedWildBeast also recommended meditation. After a quick google of mindful meditation, I think I might give it a try.  Thanks, a lot. Do you really think it's not wise to do alone? I have people that I trust, and one who is interested in meditation, but none with any formal training."
Your age is most likely the time when signs start happening and then a subsequent diagnosis would happen shortly after.  Some people don't show these signs until they are much older.  A much smaller percentage of people.  My SIL in this case didn't start developing psychosis until her 50's.
"I have one friend that I can talk to. It's nice knowing at least someone cares, but it also kinda feels bad to waste her time so I rarely say anything to her. I know professionals care at least a little bit, but I just can't get the feeling that they don't give a shit out of my head and I feel like they will just screw me over if they could earn a quick buck and that just makes me anxcious around them. Idk dude. It's like every option I have just makes it worse. Thanks for believing I can get through it tho, even tho I don't think so myself."
"I was seven, i mean i think about it a lot and remember it vividly but i don’t like think about involuntarily. I have experienced quite intense unexplained panic attacks in the past, one that sticks out with regards to this took place several hours after reading a detailed report of the incident and just walkin somewhere w my mates n feelin like i was gna die hahaha. i just, for some reason, don’t feel as though it is ptsd but that’s probably some paradoxical anxiety agonising over whether i’m dealing with the problem correctly��"
"I've been in the military for about 9 years now. A diagnosis of anything related to psychotic episodes, is a nail in the coffin of our careers sooner rather than later. It causes security clearance issues as well as issues wielding a rifle for example. The way it was explained to me, is that it's particularly hard to trust someone who can't be sure of everything they see or hear. It's unfortunate , but something I understand. It's the primary reason for me hoping it would improve or get better without the military's knowledge of the matter. "
"Something i do is this writing challenge called ‘The Artist’s Way Journal’ by Julia Cameron. Pretty much every morning i write 3 pages of thoughts, ideas or whatever you want it to be (there’s no wrong way to do it.) She describes the experience as “windscreen wipers for the mind”, and after 4 weeks i’m starting to do it consistently and feel a lot freer mentally. But i think a consistent morning routine is key, that’s what i’ve got with this. Start with something, i also use Headspace for guided meditation. All the best :)"
"Well I started out in therapy because my parents saw that I changed in a major way. I got to direct the conversation so it didn’t help so then I went to a psychiatrist and got numerous diagnoses. Now I’m back but I have terrible social anxiety. I hate being around strangers, talking to them, I’m only really comfortable around people I know. It’s honestly not helping I feel like I’ve been at for 3 months. If you feel like it isn’t helping I would see a psychiatrist before you further deteriorate and it turns into something worse. "
"Would he be willing to go? I'm not sure the protocol in the UK, as I'm in the US, but if mental health symptoms are creating a risk of harm to self, others or self neglect, which in his case sounds like it meets criteria, most places have involuntary examination available. Ours here is as simple as contacting local law enforcement for a wellness check if a person is unwilling to see a professional. Your best bet may be to contact a local psychiatric office and ask how to get him involuntarily examined based on his symptoms and go from there."
"You didn't. I hear frustration that you can't express yourself, and therefore the feelings and issues keep on going because of it, and that causes MORE frustration because you just want to be well again. I have been talking to people for a very VERY long time (just to put it into perspective I am 47 now and I have been battling mental illness since my early teen years) and it seems like nobody wants to REALLY help me. It is either here take a pill and shut up or ok we will throw you in a hospital now shut up. :( I so understand you. :) *hug*"
"&gt; if anyone is responsible for your mental health issues, it's your mother, not you.

Inadvertently it is due to her genetics combined with the father's genetics. Neither parent chose to have a child with a neurology different from their phenotypic neurology.  Many women blame vaccines partly because they know how their genes may have contributed to what their child is going through. They do not want to take on guilt and they never should take on any guilt, but blaming vaccines for their child's neurological differences [e.g. autism] is also wrong.   It is unlikely that the parents went to genetic counseling before they had children, even if they had the genetics of both ADHD and autism involve **thousands** of gene variants. https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-genetics-explained/    "
"You're not an idiot. You put up your defenses. Made it seem like everything is ok when you are falling apart inside. I do the same. I have a Mania too (pyromania) so I can relate to having to put on that mask to seem like everything is normal when in reality (most days) I am screaming inside my head for someone to save me from myself. I totally get you. I can tell you that when you go see her again in a month, you need to be as brutally honest as you can. Is there a way you can talk to her alone without your mom in there---even for a few minutes? Maybe you will be more comfortable? Please tell your Psych what is going on. We have Manias and they don't go away by themselves...we need help to conquer them (like every other mental illness). Good luck to you and I hope this month goes by fast. :)"
"Numbed feelings in general are a common symptom of depression and in some cases it can affect your ability to feel for others. I can't say if you were experiencing depression as a child as well but it is possible. And honestly some people just aren't very sentimental or dependent. You may be outside of the norm but it's not crazy to not feel strong connections to family. The fact that you were still able to develop some feelings for a girl means you are capable of feeling for others, it just takes more passion (which generally comes with infatuation) to meet your higher threshold, if that makes any sense. You definitely don't have to have had a traumatic childhood or genetic predisposition to feel what you're feeling (or not feeling). Sometimes mental illness just happens and there's not always a clear explanation. 

And I'm sorry that this isn't what you want to hear, but professional help really is important if you want to work through these things, especially suicidal and destructive thoughts, especially if they are causing you distress or interfering with your life. I'm not sure how paying someone who's job it is to help you because that's what they chose to do with their life, is worse than asking random people on the internet to offer words of advice for free. Obviously it's your choice to not seek help, but just know it's always an option and it could improve your quality if life. 

Also, good on you for being so self reflective. Continue to explore your thoughts and feelings and please don't write yourself off as doomed. Good luck dude. "

That's OK. I don't scare easily. :0P
That's not a very productive answer.
The eerily similar hospital reviews?
Then you need to go to the hospital.
These seem great! Thank you so much
This is such a first-class response!
Very nice of you my friend. Be well.

r/BPD is great for a support system
Bottom line is that you need to find what works for you. Every suggestion here is a great one. For me being outside is the best and I’m lucky that I have an emotional support animal (adorable dog) that helps me get outside everyday. Good luck and I’m sure you’ll do great on your exams!

"I know this is what I should do, but it was very hard for me to find a place to stay, I can't just move again. I will try to avoid them, but I am sure I won't be able to do it for those two days and if they should dare to insult me or him while he is around, I am not sure how he will react. "
"I'm sure you'll be a great dad someday, but if you can't get a girlfriend or wife now, it's not the end of the world. Maybe focus on yourself more? Discover new hobbies, get a degree on something you always wanted to do, etc. And talking to someone about these feelings is always a good idea."
Start by getting a referral to a Gastrointestinal doc FIRST then work on treating it as a mental health issue. You could be seriously physically ill. I have severe GI issues AND work in mental health. This is not a common mental health symptom and physical illness should be ruled out first.
"That’s okay, I thought that might be the case. For the other gender people almost never call a man over at least 20 ‘boy,’ and even as a teen it would be considered demeaning. I am often concerned that using ‘girl’ is a subtle form of sexism to degrade young women to child status. "
"When I was at my worst, I'd go outside every night and look at the sky. Stars, clouds, didn't matter. Temporary relief. If music makes you feel better, then by all means go ahead.

You really need to find someone to talk about how you're feeling; even if they're not a professional, it helps."
"Yeah, every single night without fail. I was initially prescribed diazepam for them, but I’m now on clonazepam. Doesn’t make the nightmares go away but they stop them from waking me up throughout the night in a complete panic. 

Pretty sure they’re a side effect of my antidepressants! "
Yes and no. The doctors are very silly and said i can stop whenever. When i said they beed to do some research into weaning off the did and said 2 weeks should be fine. Ive been doing it for a year to make sure everything is fine. I really dont trust them from what they told me at the start

"I've been struggling with my depression for a few years now too and i will say that it really is important to have a comfortable relationship with the therapist you choose to see. Don't feel pressured to stay with one.

But I'd also advise not to brush off the idea of taking medication. Many, if not all, will say that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance and I'd agree with that, even though I was reluctant to start.

Between keeping up with both medication and appointments with a therapist I can actually saying I've been feeling good."
"I’m tearing up as I’m writing again :’) Thank you! This mental toll is just plain ridiculous. I hope I can truly be happy again sooner than later. Right now, I can’t see the end. The guilt associated with my anxiety is off the charts and I’m not sure if I can contain it. All I really want to do is reverse time and keep it that way forever I’ve never been depressed before clinically and this is just awful. I have literally no words for this pain. I don’t mean to vent at you but the words just flow in haha. Thank you again mam! :)"
"My ex did a lot of this kind of thing. He talked about other people’s bodies, as often as he talked about mine, but rarely mentioned my personality at all in his compliments. He definitely made me feel very small and invisible and worthless. He also disregarded my feelings in the bedroom, but because of the gaslighting he was also doing, it made it hard to tell if I deserved it. Pro tip, nobody deserves to be used like that. I don’t know much about the rest of your situation, but I’d guess this is abusive behaviour. Talk to a therapist."
"Right here with all of us. Right now!! And forever. You are human. You are mighty and given life. So live friend!! Give it all you have. When you think there is nothing left to give, on your most frustrated and tired day or moment, give all the more.

Yout honesty today has brought me clarity and has inspired me the more!! Thank you! Your purpose will be made clear to you in due time. Tonight you have done right and blessed a life!!"
"Unfortunately the relationship is hardly new anymore. We're over a year and a half together and I've shared more experiences with him than anyone else. 


I don't really share the sentiment about masturbation. Going weeks or over a month without sex and masturbating isn't healthy for even marriages let alone an unmarried fairly ""fresh"" couple. 


He is naturally always hiding his phone. He does it from pretty much everyone. So I'd say it's subconscious but still intentional? He admits that and says he has always been extremely private with his personal devices.


No but I attriubte it more to the sex. Bf does not see sex as important and I believe it is. Most of our issues have been about sex but the endless rejection and weeks without love making swiftly dragged my self image into the ground "
"What would be something that you easily believe?

Remember this: depending on brain chemistry, our brain can put on quite a show. On one hand, this is mind generated fantasy - on the other hand, our subjective reality is as real as it gets.

From personal experience, there’s one advice I can give you: Don’t look for the easy way out. People turn to religion or seek enlightenment in order to finally *get it*. But a fulfilling life is created by pulling all the triggers, the little things. Eat the apple a day. Understand that everything matters. Then let things fall into place on their own.

It’s good to have professional help and it’s also good to understand basic things about brain chemistry. What is a voice in the head, who is talking? Crazy things lose power when you understand them."
"damn that sounds rough, i have aspergers and i remember when i was at college i really really struggled with socialising too. hated my skin, i have acne and eczema but overtime i’ve got better at makeup and it helps my confidence tremendously. it’s up to you if you want to wear makeup, i learned through youtube videos what to do, i only do simple makeup though. i never wear my glasses, i hate them lol. don’t fret too much though, i know there’s loads of pressure to look a certain way and act all confident and whatnot but just be yourself, ignore all the negative comments if you can. i used to have a really red face and a swollen eye due to my eczema but over time i got more comfortable just going out and not caring what i look like, most of the time it’s all in your head. good luck! "
"I don't want to diminish what you're going through so I'll start by saying that if this is causing you distress then talking to a professional should be your first step. There could be some issues at play here that you could talk through and figure out.

However, I went through something quite similar at your age. I was reading about philosophy at the time, smoking some weed, etc. and I would often get caught up in it, questioning my reality and wondering what was real and what wasn't. These days I put it down to my brain being exposed to a lot of new ways of thinking all at once and this is just how it tried to make sense of all that.

This may or may not be the case for you, but personally I look back now and consider it as just being a part of growing up and trying to figure the world out.

But, like I said, if this is causing you distress, get some help. Worst that is likely to happen is they'll reassure you that it's a pretty normal process and send you on your way, but if there's something more going on then it's better to catch it early."
"Look up some mental health call lines based in America. I live in Australia, so not sure of the best ones for you. From googling I have found:

[https://afsp.org/](https://afsp.org/)

**1-800-273-TALK (8255)** 

or you can text the hotline if you don't feel like speaking to someone over the phone

[**Crisis Text Line**](http://www.crisistextline.org/) by texting TALK to **741741**.  


Remember they're trained professionals so they will be able to give you options for free care given your circumstances if possible. You don't need to tell your family or friends about how you're feeling straight away, but once you make progress and feel comfortable to talk to someone close in your life it will make a difference.

Posting online like you have is a great first step so I'm proud of you, I know how easy it is to get caught up in your own mind and I know people say stuff like this all the time but you are important and you matter to people whether you think you do or not.   


Try doing any activities to help get your thoughts to slow down. Cleaning, reading, walking, swimming, cooking dinner, having a shower, drawing. Start a journal where you write down one good thing that has happened to you today, or in the week. Plan your days, it'll help your mind feel less jumbled. Write down how you feel and down why you think you feel those things. Once you put it into a simple perspective its easy to come up with solutions. Exercising, drinking plenty of water, eating healthy and getting some sunlight really do help you feel better. Try to set a goal to accomplish at least one task per day - big or small doesn't matter.   


I know most of this stuff you've probably already read or have heard, but it really does help once you can get your mind around it and work up the energy to do any of this. You'll need to push yourself to do better and to help yourself. At the end of the day a therapist can give you methods to help cope or medication to numb your mind, but you won't make any real progress if you don't accept that you're really the only one who can help you.

That sounds like a good idea. Thanks!
That's sweet of you to say. Thanks :)

"All you can do is love him while realizing that you can’t fix someone else. It’s hard, but everyone, including you have to come to the realization that we are the driving force behind our own lives. You can suggest ways to help, suggest meds, therapy etc but it will always come down him. "
Alright hold on. First off don’t self diagnose your girlfriend even if it most likely seems to be depression. Second the hospital can’t diagnose her? Sounds like a shitty hospital. Tell to her to see a psychiatrist or apnp(advanced nurse practitioner) that works at a psychiatrist office.
"Death has been my closest friend for years. It's not death that I fear it's the thought of having to live that scares me. I don't fear the overthinking either. That wasn't my piont either.

I was trying to explain that just because it's not a big issue for you it can be crippling for others. "
"I agree with some of this, but i still believe that they’re painting this out in a bad light. The editing makes it seem so.  I understand that this has got kids to talk about mental health and that’s really good. I just think that this could have been executed and edited in a better way. "
"I go to a tiny school in middle of nowhere, we don’t really have a counselor here. We have someone under that title but it’s not what they do. I figure the school is required to have one so they just have the few people here multiple titles so the school could be open legally or whatever "
"I sometimes have this issue and I have learned that it helps me to say something like, ""So what I hear you saying is (xyz) is that right?"" While sometimes annoying, it helps you to immediately get a sense of whether or not you understand and also helps to hone your skills. Good luck, friend.
"
"If you're worried about disappointing your family then please don't do this. I don't know you or what you're going through but, death is forever. You cannot take it back. I hope that this reaches you in time before you either go through with it or seriously hurt yourself. 

Please seek help. "
"It's been about 2 years, and throughout the 2 years I've been feeling steady but subtle improvements in my mental health, part of it is that I'm very dedicated to my therapy and treatments, but the progress is very slow and it's still causing severe impairments in my career and relationships."
I’ve also found that diagnoses and kind of subjective. I’ve seen different professionals in a short span of time and gotten different diagnoses. It could just be your current therapist’s take.  You could ask for your medical file if you want to read more about it or get another opinion
Something I struggle with too (and I'll reference my posting history here). I am just feeling like I'm coming to some kind of acceptance that I'm dealing with a mixture of actual events and anxiety and that those two things are kind of feeding off each other to make the whole situation worse.
"Try to answer these please, and take your time, not just single sentences!

What sort of therapy did you do?  

What did they say that make you feel like you got nowhere?  

What could have gone differently?  

What did you expect them to do?  

What did you do to change thing in your life?  "
"I give in...I have a special place I can indulge, and it is safe. Today, it is running wild though. Just had to give in more times than I could count over the past 2-1/2 hours or so.  


My mania can be very destructive, so I always have to keep that in mind when I am giving in to my urges. I am 100% safe 100% of the time, and if I can't be safe (my family is around, there is not enough time for me to indulge and take my precautions, etc.) I do not do it. Holding it in also hurts, but it is better than destroying my house and family's life. :("
"I'm from the US so Idk if this is helpful, but this video is about getting help in the [NHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D5s9TNq1Q8). Therapist Kati Morton has a ton of great videos on just about any subject you could search and her channel is worth checking out.

There's also [Befrienders](https://www.befrienders.org/) and [Rethink](https://www.rethink.org/) and [Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org/). All of those groups have resources to help you find what you need.

Your doctor sounds like shit. Is there any way to see someone else?"
"It sounds an awful lot like ADHD to me, but of course I'm no expert - just offering a suggestion for further investigation if you're so inclined.  My experience with diagnosis was very simple and straightforward, and took place during a routine appointment with my psychiatrist at the time.  This was nearly 15 years ago, so perhaps things are different now.  

It sounds like a frustrating scenario you've got going on, so whatever is causing it, I do hope you are able to find some guidance and direction to alleviate these challenges.  Good luck!"
Thank you. I have thought about it but it's honestly so hard to explain. It's like I have a constant battle with myself and the bad side always wins. Even when I know what I'm doing is wrong I still do it! It's like self destruction and I don't even know why. I want to stop. Maybe I'm just lazy? I do sleep a lot! I have really no motivation.I have depressive episodes where I just want to sleep. Not go to work or see my friends or do anything. I tell myself constantly I need to stop and I need to change but I find myself doing it all over again
"This seems more like depression and social anxiety

Before you achieve everything you want, do you understand yourself?

Being happy can be being alone and letting things slip away but it also can be being great at something.

Remember that happiness are just chemicals on your brain, if you do the reasonable things those chemicals tell you youll be happy no matter what.

If you want to live by your or society standards go to a psychologiss the might send you to a psychiatrist but in the end it its worth it when you can do what you really want."

"love Shane’s videos but I 100% agree with this. It’s upsetting to watch considering how often things like this happen with so many mental illnesses. He seems to just be falsely informed. Hopefully someone reaches out to him and he corrects himself 

Edit: He does show a clip of a girl who has ASPD talking about what it’s like and in her full video she describes it nothing like how he’s making it out to be. Either he didn’t watch her entire video and just took that clip (which I kinda doubt) or he’s doing it for the dramatic effect "
"
im glad that you’re acknowledging the fact that you there is a problem and certain things won’t fix it. If you feel like you’re a burden on this particular friend then you should stop confiding in her because having close friends misunderstanding you is often worse than not saying anything. I hope she did understand, though. 

sometimes people go through a period of time where daily routine becomes harder to do. maybe take this time to try something new? something that’s so different from your past activities/hang outs?

 i took a course in german even though I didn’t need it. It took my mind off things and made me meet new people. 

note: its actually v brave of you to let your friend know. but if she can’t keep up, walk away. it gradually becomes toxic esp now that ur vulnerable "
"It was very simple to follow, thank you! We're definitely working on communicating more. We had always said that communication needs to be constant between us, especially in tough times, but of course, you know humans love procrastinating on issues. 

But we're starting to see our fight as a wake up call to actually start talking about what's getting to us. We were both childish and stupid. I want to work out a plan for her triggers, but I'm still trying to figure out what all of them are. Trial and error, I guess!

I want us to last and we're both willing to put in the work. We just need to stop being stubborn with each other and with ourselves. 

Thank you for your advice! I wish you well with all of your issues and hope you're getting the help that you need to keep on fighting and winning!

"Hey. You've made it this far. I believe you can keep doing it. It's hard, no doubt about it. There are days where I want to die, or can't get out of bed. Where my passions felt like chores. But we're all works in progress, and I believe that you can make it until some of the light comes back. "

I get it. Promise. It doesn't have to be that way. I hope you will get some help and try a few things for a while before you make that decision. You can have a chance a fulfilling life. I know it's easier said than done and can be hard to even imagine. Send me a message if you'd like to chat.
"I get that you may be coming from a good POV on your end, but you're advocating for people to not seek treatmant nor diagnosis, which is far from the point of the sub and is definitely an unsafe POV for certain people. This sub is meant to assist people with their mental health, not avoid it. "
"I think by talking about this and reflecting upon it, you‘ve already done something good for yourself.

It’s not your job to fix it with a certain thought that would bring clarity - these rarely come. If you keep this up with the help of a professional, you have a good start in my opinion."
"I think the key to it is just not taking it personally. I know that's easier said than done. But try to ignore it and focus on the other people and the activity at hand. 

You're not a bad person for feeling annoyed, but you are probably making yourself more miserable by letting it get to you "
"In case you haven't already worked it out........

&amp;#x200B;

try going to your gp for a mental health plan so you can see a psychologist (10 free visits per year I think). You may need a psychiatrist for an actual diagnosis but ii imagine they can help you find one if needed.

"It really doesn't matter. Things I need to do in my house. Things that will make things work better at work. Things that will make me feel better with my diet. Things to stop saying.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever it is, make it something you can do and do it. Every little check is an endorphin rush."
My anxiety is a bit beyond distractions a lot of the time especially when I have panic attacks. Vigorous exercise can help but the best way to cope sometimes is to put your head in a bucket of ice water for as long as you can hold your breath. This initiates a dive reflex which calms you down.
"Nope another medication.   
My mind is torturing me right now. I can't quiet these cravings/impulses, even though I just got done doing what this stupid disorder WANTS me to do...I just did it, but it wants more. It is greedy today and it is getting me down.

How are YOU doing right now? &lt;3"
"Oh your description sounds awful! I think that may happen to me, I get that kind of fatigue or sedation easily. I was thinking about cutting my 25mg in half but I think now I'll cut it in quarters. I also want to give it a chance since as you say many people get a good benefit from it. Thanks!"
"Re the title, that’s true. But that’s not what they’re for. If you’re unstable, they may help you to become stable to better deal with your issues. If you want to kill yourself, they may help you with those thoughts. They are a tool to help you along, not a fix-all that doesn’t exist"
"Sounds a bit odd but do you keep a journal at all? I've kept one for the last 6 months or so. When it comes time to talk about something or to understand how I am actually feeling, from an external perspective I've found it really helps. I try to write everyday to just get out the daily stuff."
That's the problem. You ARE illogical. You see the world backwards. You probably smoke cigarettes and tell others not to because they will kill you. That's ILLOGICAL. Depressed people ARE why Trump was elected. He was the illogical choice. That made him the logical choice to depressed people.
This is so similar to me! I had a really rough time this time last year and althought it was awful and this change in season keeps reminding me of it I oddly miss it? Maybe miss is the wrong word... This feeling is so much stronger if I listen to music I listened to at the same time last year.
This is the problem. You admitted to being depressed. That means YOU admitted to a mental illness. I am not mentally ill. That's why you think there's something wrong with me. You don't realize you have the problem. You don't realize you surrounded yourself with people just like you. Unhappy.
"What is DBT, and can you provide any reliable resource materials? This may be relevant to my mental / emotional needs as well. I am completely lacking direction regarding effective treatment. 

*OP, I greatly empathize with your position and I hope you are able to find positive coping skills.*"
"Yeah, I guess what I mean is that it takes a while to adjust. You're going through an immense amount of change in a small amount of time. I felt like I was sinking for the first week or two but it slowly became easier as I adjusted to the change and started to understand the people around me. "
"I am eternally optimistic but still doubt that we'll ever get to a point where mental health care is anywhere near adequate. There are so many individual variables involved and not enough experienced professionals or even enough research for that matter. You'd think they could at least handle validation by this point, no matter how exhausted they might be. I'm sorry you're experiencing this. It took me decades to find someone I believe wants to help and would do everything in her power to do so. All the luck to you in finding something similar."
"Im currently in CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and it helps some but alot of sessions my mom joins to figure out whats going on with my mental health bc i dont tell her because she yells at me for having problems and i dont want her to not let me see my girlfriend, i still love her just these two incidents have my head in a daze, she said she wouldnt do it again and that she was truly sorry and she wouldnt have done it if she knew how i was feeling that day, im going to trust her for now but if this happens again i will not be as forgiving "
"There is no scientific validity to serotonin theory. The reason we can say that is we can remove serotonin as an active neurotransmitter, and its removal makes no difference to mood. There is a lot of work in this area. This review article is one example 

https://jdc.jefferson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1367&amp;context=jeffjpsychiatry

The idea that serotonin in isolation directly affects mood is a myth perpetuated by drug companies as a means to sell drugs, not a function of the actual state of the science of how brain chemistry works. "
"What was it about your therapist that you were drawn to? Is it possible to follow him to where ever he went? 

As for trusting new professionals, I always tell myself that it's a new chance to share my story with someone. Fresh eyes, fresh takes on things. 

But at the same time, I always hold professionals at arm's length. It's almost like how I feel going to a doctor. You rattle off your symptoms and work with them to make the symptoms go away. I have a very shallow rapport with all my physicians and my therapist, now that I think about it..."
"Yes, you are going to have to be a fighter, and in order to make the move as less complex as possible, you are going to have to pair down your possessions.  Start adopting a new lifestyle around traveling light and being self-sufficient, and be willing to let stuff go that you can't carry with you.  You are going to be living hand to mouth for a while, but free.

In a relatively short span of time, about a week, you need to find a new place to live, tell him you are leaving, and then leave.  Your next place should be stable, but small and safe."
"Hi, it looks to me like you are dealing with depression brought on by emotional exhaustion from the stresses of everyday life (I am no expert, I just have dealt with depression myself and know the feeling). 

My advice, and I apologize if it is unsolicited, is this. You should talk to your partner about how you feel, if you think he will listen. If there are other people in your life that you trust, you should talk to them too. 

Also, look into therapy, specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT helps you by giving you tools to change the way you think for the better. 

As much as there are good parts to the world there are bad parts. I know it does not seem like it, I have been in some really dark places, but if you reach out to those close to you you can start feeling better. 

Good luck!"
"I'm not sure how common it is really. It could be an over active imagination when you were a child, or some kind of hallucinatory experiences. Depending on how vivid the experiences were. If you were literally seeing people that weren't there that would be a cause for concern. I don't really have enough to go on here to help you much more. If it still happens I would definitely speak to a mental health professional about it. Full scale hallucination can be indicative of some pretty serious conditions.

Though again, if it were simply the particularly overactive imagination of a child and it was more that you were imagining them to be there rather than literally seeing corporeal manifestations, and it's not been a proper cause for concern of yours, then I would try not to worry too much about it."
Some people would beg to differ but to be honest I am pretty much with you on life being intolerable. I desperately want to die but am afraid to commit suicide because I fear I will fail and end up even more incapacitated than I already am now. I wish euthanasia was an option. I don’t think it should be readily available to everyone because some people go through tough times and come out the other side and would probably regret ending their life but there has to be a line somewhere. If someone continually expresses a wish to die over a long period of time and the suffering is unrelenting how is it fair to make them keep living. There are already too many people in the world anyway. Maybe if the ones who don’t want to be here were allowed to go the world would be a better place for everyone.
"Three years ago I was working as a counselor on crisis hotlines when my dad died.  I started having psychotic symptoms shortly after his death.  I did not have hallucinations, but I had delusions.  I believed I was being spied on, I believed I was getting ""hidden messages"" in videos and songs.  I took the batteries out of the smoke detector because I believed it had a hidden microphone in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved back in with my mom, got divorced from my husband, got hospitalized a couple times and gained 50 pounds from the medication.  A few months ago, the delusions finally started to fade in to the background and stop.  I think I'm doing better now than I have been in years, even though I'm still unemployed.  I can't say what helped me snap out of my delusions, but these things come and go."
"what I've been doing for eye exercise during breaks to reduce strain is changing my environment (to get different lighting - so if I've been inside all day I'll step out for a bit and look at something in the distance and then move my gaze around actively to focus on different points briefly so at least there's some movement and my eyes are still getting a break from prolonged focus. 

when I was a student, I would print out any long articles or readings i had to do (like if they were 5+ pages). I know that might not necessarily be doable for everyone but reducing my screen time reading as much as possible really helped on a day to day level. 

here's an article from healthline that describes a few (and better than I did lol)

"I feel that, even with health insurance, those bills pile up fast. I've been going to a med provider and therapist for a while, and while it's mostly covered, I still have a hard time with the bills. I've been finding lately that self help books from my library are helping A LOT. My therapist doesn't have all the answers, and she's only trained so much. My med provider can only help with medicine, he doesn't understand the deep issues. So putting in a lot of work on my own and not relying on just them has been very helpful. No one knows what you're going through better than you. Reddit has also helped me a ton, it's good to have a group of people like this on your side. America's health care system sucks, and it sucks hard for mental health patients. I wish there was more I could help you with, always call everywhere you can and ask them if they take your insurance and also call your insurance company and ask if it's covered and how much exactly you would have to pay (ALWAYS ask the persons name you're talking to, write it down, time and date, everything you can. I got in a huge battle with my insurance company over $900 because someone told me my service would be covered, thankfully I wrote everything down and I was right and they paid the bill). Good luck, I hope you can find the help you need. "
"I wrote my thesis on using mindfulness based psychotherapies for complex trauma victims.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, if you are doing CBT, you are already doing mindfulness anyway.  Monitoring your thoughts for cognitive distortions already puts you in the place of having to observe your own thought train mindfully.

&amp;#x200B;

Mindfulness is something that has to be practiced with effort for a long time before it becomes effortless.  But the more practiced you are at it, the more benefit you get.  It's like a muscle you have to work out.  When you really observe your mind, you'll find you jump from one thing to the next faster than you could ever say out loud.  A mindfull person who's practiced at it can stop themselves after that first distressing thought so your paranoid thought is just a passing thought dismissed immediately before it has a chance to get your body pumping stress hormones and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep practicing categorizing your thoughts when you notice them until it becomes second nature to just block that thought train in it's tracks and move on.  And keep your eye out for anything else that helps you feel better.  Monitoring your thoughts all the time will put you in a good place to recognize when something is of slight benefit like a shower or a walk, ect..

&amp;#x200B;"
"I'm going to be honest. I don't think your career goals should affect any psychologist for giving a diagnosis though. I hope you don't take that the wrong way if a psychologist after a reasonable time is suspicious about a diagnosis you need to consider it. I mean over here that information is privet for pretty much all jobs. Police,army, ect excluded. 

I know that might sound harsh but a preliminary diagnosis isn't final. It's not easy to hear maybe but I hope you realize that they're not there to insult you or crush your dreams. However just like you they should be honest with you. Even if that's bringing bad news or a grounded suspicious they have. I hope you understand that? 

I'm not trying to be an ahole please don't blame me. It's just that the relationship with a psychologist works best when you're both honest. They shouldn't just tell you what you want to hear otherwise it's more financially sound to buy scratch tickets. Honesty works best in a two way street. You can be honest about preferring another psychologist or second opinion they need to be honest about their professional opinion regarding suspected diagnosis. 

I really hope this hasn't put you off from getting help! Even though you might disagree at first with them as long as they have valid reasoning try being open to it. 

Even a diagnosis when tested isn't an end station. Be honest with yourself that something might make sense for them to reach that preliminary opinion. It's not to bully you. It's too help you even if they're wrong the test might piont out something interesting or a lead.

I really hope you decided to give it another shot. Like I said the information is confidential. I felt devastated by my diagnosis at first but I learned my bottlenecks and how to deal with it!

I hope to hear from you!

Kind regards,

Astyv "
"My experience hasn't been quite the same.  Your description makes it sound like the Matrix and teaching Neo to make the jump...first understand ""there is no spoon.""  My treatment was based a lot on what I believe is called Cognitive Restructuring.  
..

My therapist had me specify thoughts I didn't like (I am worthless, I am stupid, etc), analyze whether the thoughts were true, and then focus on the triggers which prompted these thoughts - the idea was that when I would normally think an undesirable thought, I would replace it with a thought I knew to be true.  I didn't let my mind and programed default messages fill my head, but would actively change my thought when I recognized it, owning and controlling my response until I began to rewrite what I knew/believed about the world.

..

My therapist had many different approaches to the generalization, above.  My homework was different every session, and I had freedom to adapt the instructions to a way that was most useful for me before the next session (I was very encouraged to do so, in fact) - the key being to make progress toward my stated goals, and refer to my therapist for advice, encouragement, and professional observations.  Examples:  In dealing with my father's suicide, I started by writing what I felt and facing those emotions.  Later, I would allow myself to be angry and write about it.  I was asked, then, if I could record and remember any good memories with my dad.  I was asked to re-frame my ""I'm responsible"" statements about his addictions and suicide to see whether I would say the same about my own son (who is about the age, now, that I was then).  I took feelings/beliefs (I am stupid, etc) and wrote evidence that supported or argued against that statement, and decided if I really believed it was true.  

..

The idea was that my thoughts *are*...they aren't good or bad; they just *are*.  That doesn't make them correct, and I don't have to be subject to them.  In fact, I can decide to change them.  My therapist never told me what to think, but asked me to set goals, evaluate my truths, and helped me along the way.

..

Some things I couldn't see without her - like why did I sometime feel I wanted to go back to drinking now that I felt better?  She helped me understand my drinking was a response to my huge levels of stress - a poor response, but a way I chose to cope with bad feelings, before.  Now that I'm recovering from depression, and am no longer numb, I'm experiencing big emotions again, and drinking is the most recent way that I am used to using to handle those feelings.  The drinking doesn't really control me, but my thoughts and habits can, if I let them.  In response, I paid more attention to the times I felt that way, was more conscious about why I had that thought, and responded in a healthier way with my post-depression energy (I needed to prepare for a presentation, so I would brainstorm some ideas, ask for help, or define the scope of what I needed to do rather than leaving it ambiguous).

..

I am certain it will be different for everyone, but my experience was based on concrete results, goals, and specific tasks to help me progress.  I was never encouraged to separate myself from my thoughts, but feel more in control of them, and believe them to be more accurate now.  There was a period I felt like I had ""lost sight of the shore"" when I realized I did not have to remain anchored to things my father had made me believe (about myself and others) - after letting go of that, I felt un-tethered and without a foundation, for a bit...most of my belief system started with those basic assumptions, after all.  I have started creating a ""new normal"" for myself, though.  Intrusive thoughts still come up from time to time, with events I may not be prepared for, but my responses are more often based on this new normal, or quickly fall into line when I think about how I am going to decide to feel and respond.

..

I am amazed at how much I was allowing myself to be a victim to thoughts that others had put into my head, and how blind I was to evidence which would refute those beliefs.  I told my therapist that it seems so easy, and that I should have been able to come to these realizations myself - she says I'm not the first to say so, but to not lose sight of the fact that she is professionally trained to help in these specific areas.  While she can't do my job, because she's not trained in it, I should no more feel responsible to do hers.

..

I hope you are able to find a therapist that is effective for you.  If you are not making measured progress towards a specific goal that you and your therapist agree to, I encourage you to try a different therapist.  They are not all the same.  I was very lucky to have an effective one, but I attribute that to the clinic's intake process which tried to match me up to the right person, too.  

..

Don't be afraid to change or adapt your goals, either, as you progress.  State your concerns up front, so they are considered in the treatment (your concerns are valid ones).  State your previous experiences with therapy and what you hope to get out of any new sessions.  I went in trying to improve my relationship with my wife, because I knew I was affecting it.  I ended up treating my depression, and then attacking the root causes of my inaccurate belief system in order to prevent it from happening again.  I am nearing a point where I think my therapist and I will terminate our normal recurring appointments and transition to less regular follow-up care for a time.  She told me from the beginning that the goal was always for me to stop seeing her, after all!

..

I hope that helps.  Please don't hesitate to ask any additional questions (or anyone else who may be reading this).  I feel better knowing my personal experience can have a positive outcome if I am able to share it with someone who is in a similar situation."

"Yes this, seems like lots of red flags "

never did that one... why did you do it
"Exposure yourself to fearful stimulus every day. Don't run away from the physical feelings of anxiety and fear. They will dissipate if you just allow yourself time. Stand on top of a park bench. Watch the people looking at you. They are thinking you're weird, and guess what? You'll survive it. "
"I also have an unhealthy obsession, and what I do when I find myself obsessing excessively is distract myself with something totally unrelated and funny/cute/weird. It gets my mind off of my obsession for a while. Sometimes this is a constant battle, and I get that. Same here. Good luck to you!"
"I deal with chronic pain and anxiety. The blanket (15lb, I’m around 115lb) is a life saver. I haven’t slept a day without it since it arrived. I sleep with less pain most importantly but my anxiety has also decreased, my quality of sleep has increased, and it’s just very very comforting. "
"I got better in a rather unconventional way, but it's very much to the same tune as what Offthepoint is saying – cognitive therapy. That being said, a huge part of it for me was also a change up in medication (I'm schizophrenic), switching to a low carb diet, and getting a lot more exercise."
"I hope everything works out for you. I am a recovering alcoholic, but I am ok with talking about alcohol and stuff like that, and of course, mental illness (I have 3 active problems right now). What I am saying is that you don't have to be afraid to talk to me about anything. I am here for you."
"I mentioned to her that I'm getting urges to punch people and she held my hands to prevent it from happening. I'm talking to a psychiatrist Monday and I don't know when my therapist would be available, but it's not gonna be Friday. I don't know how I'll get through the weekend if I'm like this."
"I've been zoning out all year.. I think it's because we're caught up in our heads and even freeze up at times. A few weeks ago I was outside as a storm was rolling in and it took about two minutes of being poured on and someone asking me why I was just standing in the rain to ""snap out"" of it. "
If you want to end your life so bad then do it yourself. Don't bring someone else into it. Plus there's a good chance that little plan won't work . Most cops don't shoot to kill. Im sorry you are suffering but I find it disturbing that you don't care how badly you would traumatize someone else
"Like you said a personality disorder can be brought down to its knees. it just needs patience and the right strategies.

 I have a friend which has bpd but she manages it very very well but sometimes she has relapse that last a week or so but nothing bad just she doesn't want to talk to anyone."
"My general thesis has always been finding a creative outlet for frustrations. Creativity always helps me when I have anxious days. Another big one is meditation, which you can do anywhere at any time. Breathing exercises, etc. Those are two really low cost options, and they're pretty effective."
"OMG. Theres no easy way to say it. Tell her you need help, it isn't anything anyone can do to make you feel better now, but you need help. I'm sorry youre struggling so much. You're very young, theres so much to live for that you just don't know about yet, but will come with age. Pls hang on ! "
"Physical activities would include working around the house and going to the gym (not as often lately because I’ve been doing a lot of home projects and landscaping).

I consider myself agnostic. I would like their to be an afterlife, but I have a lot of doubt and I’ve always been that way. "
"The problem with things like pornography is that what you find acceptable others find boring and vice versa.

You did nothing wrong other than seeing something that offends you.  Life is like that.

I have two relatives who are in law enforcement and I could not do that job for love  nor money."
"Your therapist is a professional and it should not matter whatsoever if you potentially offend them. Apologize if you want, but it's not necessary.

However, you should force yourself to be more open minded about this whole exercise and maybe let the therapist explain what they're trying to do."
I agree with anyone who say that you need to get through the proper diagnosis system. You parents are maybe old school generation but they need to understand that depression is not a temporary emotional state but mental disorder impacting your life in negative way which you are proving already. Even with support of your social circle it is very hard to go through without medication. There has been done a comprehensive research in this case and admitting that you need a professional help is a big service you doing yourself regards to your future.
"I have a lot of anxiety about being in groups of people. I've talked a few times while I was there, and I haven't really met a bad person there. But it's really just not for me. I think getting my chips was... helpful.. I don't have a lot of confidence. So having to admit I do have a problem can hurt more than it helps sometimes. 

I do have a therapist, but the last couple sessions have kind of put me off. 

I don't pay anything to see my current therapist. He's a good dude and trying, but I think I'm a little different than his other clients. "
"I really dont want to take antidepressants. They can prominently decrease libido, cause an addiction/dependence, and their initial side effects like tiredness are really inconvenient to functioning in the day. I've functioned and coped very well while just on antipsychotics. I do not need to take medication to feel happy if lack of happiness is not inhibiting my value in life or is not inhibiting my functioning. I'm perfectly okay without antidepressants and feel no need to stop my depressive symptoms because they really are not hurting my life."
"I've had a similar issue for a while. Recently lost my third job due to depression symptoms. I'm glad you're starting early. 

I've started a DBT class that doctors and therapists have told me will help build skills in areas like managing distress and emotional regulation. Also going to see a psychiatrist for new meds. Hoping this will do the trick. Finally, also seeing what I can do on my own to live a fulfilled life outside of work (e.g., work on my own creative projects, exercise, see friends).

Have you seen a therapist? 

Good luck to you. "
"My exwife emotionally abused me to point of me getting pretty bad CPTSD.  Even though she cheated on me multiple times,  convinced me I was bipolar (I am not), stole from me,  lied regularly and tried to turn our kids against me,  I still trusted her.  Looking back, I am guessing part of me wanted to give her a chance to do the right thing.  Like it would help heal me in some way.  Reset the clock.  But she just kept taking and taking from me.  I am at a point in recovery now that I feel sorry for her because she will never find true happiness. "
"We can't live in a world where we don't hurt anyone, his emotions really aren't your responsibility. You sound conscientious and considerate. You've done all you can, and if your managing to keep your distance that's great. I know he's your friend, but you sound much better off without him. Understanding that others feel fear is how emotionally abusive people operate, because that's how they feel. Dont be afraid of him, I genuinely doubt he'll do anything to harm you. The worst he'll do is try to make you feel bad, but I think you've got this ;)"
"But contacting the authorities may not stop the school shooting. If there is no way for the cops to see criminal intent, they may just pack up and leave. The boy gets cautious of what he says and who knows what happens. The authorities overlooked Cruz, and the Columbine killers were known to police and in anger management and they fooled them.

Don't politicise this shit, I don't care about guns or your beliefs, I'm not even American. What I'm saying, I thought, was pretty simple. Is that don't force this persons hand (if they are even serious), we should only advise and not back them into a corner. We don't know enough about the situation other than he has a liking for mass killers, not exactly a whole lot to go on, and not enough to go play hero and force our own solutions, that could not work."
"I definitely think you should go to the doctor. None of us are really qualified to tell you what is best to do for your anxiety though. 

Just a personal opinion: it definitely sounds like anxiety, and severe anxiety to me. It’s great that you recognize that the issue is there and have a good idea of what it stems from. 

Therapy: My personal experience was that you don’t get put on meds right away. They made me go for an evaluation, see a therapist, and then a psychiatrist for medications. On top of that, they may definitely prescribe something different for you depending on your symptoms and actual diagnosis will be. 


Closing point is that if you think you need help, then you probably do. It seems like you’re very self aware so I hope you can take this recognition and actually apply it."
"I was once had a friend tell me to exercise because then my problems would go away. I yelled at him and now we aren't friends.... I guess it taught me that even people who know you can sometimes not understand. I know is bad but I don't even mention it anymore. When I'm having a bad day, my boss thinks I have a headache. It's sad that we have to hide sometimes. Your frustration is completely valid and I just want you to know that you are stronger than you think. Don't let what he said get to you. Sometimes people act like that because they don't like things they don't understand and they are intimidated and don't want to learn. But that's their loss. I'm proud of you for the willpower you have, even when you don't see it. We're a bunch of strangers on the internet but we're here. We hear you&lt;3"
"I've been fighting depression since childhood, starting from primary school, but didn't realise till high school, and finishing that. Seeing a psychologist/therapist is at the very top of the list of things to do, it's just getting over the nerves and having the courage to make the call difficult, along with having money problems. I live in Australia and how mental health help works, at least to what I know, is we get 10 sessions with rebate, get some money back (either $84, or $124, depending), but we can't use all 10 in one go. We go 6 times, then see our gp, and depending on what they say, we get the other 4, then we pay full price after the 10. We see the gp after the 10, I think, but I'm not sure what happens afterwards. I don't think Australia gets free mental health care, but I'm not sure."
"The thing is, despite her past, nothing you have described is manipulative behavior. It may make you uncomfortable, and that’s okay and it’s within your rights to set boundaries, but it’s not overtly harmful. While a person’s background can color how they act, it doesn’t necessarily color every single thing they do. You seem to be putting together “behavior that makes you uncomfortable” + “abuse history etc” = “she must be manipulating me” without any instances of you actually being manipulated.

Talking about money/excessive gift giving is difficult for pretty much everyone, and I can definitely empathize. Like you said, if you have the conversation and she reacts in a disproportionate or harmful way, that’s another story, and then you have to evaluate your relationship. "
"Fellow Christian here!

I don’t know how old you are or what your family is like but now is the time to lean on them, if they provide that kind of support that is. 

I opened up to my mother about what I’m going through and I remember that car ride like it was yesterday. My minister mother basically just said I need to return to church. That’s the solution!

I was disappointed and close to anger but a friend had already advised me to stay calm. Sometimes people don’t or choose overlook these kinds of things. If your family is supportive enough, they’ll help you see and talk to someone. 

If they aren’t, which is often the crushing thing at times, you will have to go at it with close friends, allies and even strangers. And that’s okay too. 

I’m a tongue speaking guy who grew up in church all his life. It is okay to see and speak with someone. It only compliments the work that God is doing inside of you. You’ve certainly not lost your faith. You’re working the process. Put God first if you really believe, then work that process."
"I guess quality of therapy comes down a lot to two things; where you are at, and what the relationship between you and the therapist is like. I remember seeing some research long time ago that basically said the quality of the relationship is a lot more important than the modality the therapist uses. 

I would put 1:1 therapy right alongside group therapy for helping potential. Personally I have benefited from both for different reasons, and I would encourage anyone who hasnt done group to explore it. 

When you are in therapy with a therapist its pretty important to have an agenda of what you want to discuss, I think. Knowing what you want to talk about - and keeping each session on topic is a good way to keep things relevant. Also, dont be scared to train your therapist - this is something I think a lot of people dont do - tell them whats working and tell them also what isnt. Without the feedback they have limited clues about how well they are doing and risk making the same mistakes, or not repeating techniques they have used which are helpful. "
"My SIL suffers from schizophrenia. It was hell trying to get her some help because she didn't think anything was wrong with her and nobody was believing her persecutory delusions.  Her behaviours just got worse and worse until she finally agreed to see a therapist just so we'd stop bugging her.  She refuses to take medication despite being told if she takes it the thoughts she's having will most likely subside.  But she thinks we are part of a government organization that's trying to poison her via medication and then we will take her kids away from her and kill them.

She will have to come to the realization on her own, OR if she's at risk to herself or others you can get a court order to get her admitted into a psych ward and get help. 

After that - it's up to your friend to continue treatment.  

Mental illness is extremely difficult. Especially the more complex illnesses. 

I'm sorry your friend is going through this and I'm sorry you feel helpless. 

You can only do so much though.  She needs to be the one that will submit to being helped.  "
"i think the only accurate diagnosis i've gotten is PTSD from bullying (includes shit like being strangled until i was close to losing consciousness), dropping out and moving schools and losing my family's support and all my friends that i'd had for years (bc i'd failed in their eyes). i basically have phobias and triggers to do with school, so i can't further my education. i'm a really slow learner (not low IQ just poor working memory, which i discovered could be a result of childhood stress), so i need help, but i also live in a country that's very ""every man for himself"", and no one has the patience for me. i can't afford private tutors or anything. i get triggered if someone so much as looks at me in the wrong way and i wanna kill them. on public transport i get lost in my thoughts, making up potential scenarios of violence where i'll have to fight off attackers, etc. basically it's hell. 

edit: i should probably mention i live a very solitary life. the only reason i haven't killed myself is because of my wife who is also like me in many ways. i just wish i had friends besides her. i wouldn't mind working with other people if the other people weren't shitty to me but i'm such a weirdo at this point that it's hard not to annoy others with my mere presence, which has happened at my previous jobs."

"Admitting to having a plan and intent to commit suicide and then being placed in restraints in the hospital. Honestly the most traumatizing experience in my life. I'm honestly surprised that she is still in denial after all that suffering, when getting treatment could alleviate so much of that. "
"After a few minutes of reflection, i concluded that my parents are not abusive. They do care for me.
In my religion you are supposed to respect your parents no matter what. 
Thank you for your help, helped to get a hold of myself and made me realize that theyre not as bad as i thought they were."
"Can I ask what help you're getting or have found useful? I'm in a similar situation and I can't find help anywhere. I'm desperate to not become another suicide statistic but when it's heading that way, I dunno it's like a runaway train and your using your foot as a brake in some futile attempt. "
"Hey man, I completely understand. We're scared about one thing, and it makes us vulnerable to all of our other fears and worries, they feel so interconnected. It's painful, it sucks, but we gotta have the hope that it gets better. I'm just starting the healing process, I know you can do it too. "
I would break some pills in half so it will last the whole time just so it's in your system so you dont start to withdrawal. SSRI withdrawal can be pretty terrible. You can also call your psychiatrist and ask them if you can see them sooner. They may not have realized it was scheduled this way.
"No, he is extremely suicidal. He's always wanted to die even on a ""good day"" and is an alcoholic because of the constant pain he's in. What he is doing is manipulative, but there's truth behind what he's saying and I don't think he meant it to be manipulative at all. He's just in constant pain. "
"Obviously not a psychologist but have you looked into Borderline Pesonality Disorder? Used to be called emotional dysregulation or something long those lines. Could be worth mentioning it to your gp xx stay strong
(couples counselling could also be worth looking into if it affecting both of you)"
"Personally there's no way if have done it without meds and therapy together. 

I tried loads of meds before we got it right. 

I tried CBT, exposure and EMDR therapies. EMDR was fucking awful and made me worse. 

You have to be open to trying it all though. Stuff works differently for everyone. "
"Thanks so much, what a nice comment. 

There are so many of us who struggle and we all can help each other. :)

The idea of not having to believe everything I think was a real game-changer to me. It was a complete tangent to everything I had always believed before and really helped me step back."

"I feel like mental health in my country is too stigmatized and I’m a victim of going with the flow. I’m weary of my family as well .. if they were to find out they’d blow it way out of proportion and it’d create a lot of unecessary hassle. They start asking lots of questions, they get concerned and they worry with no regard for personal space, and I’m not a big fan of burdening other people.

The fact that such help isn’t exactly cheap here doesn’t help either. I’ll keep it as a last resort in case this continues longer I suppose."
"Oh yeah, totally. I had spoken to my narcissistic mother's therapist one time, and admitted to a couple of things and she told me ""you should get tested for a personality disorder."" My therapist of 4+ years flipped out because I definitely do not have BPD (I was afraid I did), and she couldn't believe how appallingly unprofessional this lady was to suggest I had BPD after one phone call. Just suggesting OP is careful about how they are diagnosed is all. I don't think BPD should be diagnosed right away. 

But OP if you do have it, I wish you well!"
"That's exactly why I point out getting more skin in the game, the vast majority of life is monotonous.  Finding those little rushes is hard and most people just don't care to risk it all to feel alive. I figure we've only got one shot and it's better to enjoy the things we can. I focus on the next rush and just push through until I get there. My last good one was 18 hour days on my mc cross country for 2 weeks, sleeping on the side of the roads with my Sig for a pillow. Some times the only good parts of life are what others would consider rough. "
"That’s a good idea. I know it’s hard to leave the house and interact with people. I kind of feel the same sometimes. But hiding in your house for days on end and not talking to any one only perpetuates the apathy. It’s kind of like stay inside and make the apathy worse (because eventually you have to leave to either go to work/school whatever) or force yourself to leave the house and maybe talk to people you trust, if you have anyone that you can open up to. even tho it’s kind of painful at times. It’s kind of a double edged sword sadly"
"Cameras distort your image, period. Look at how various lenses treat different subjects (google 50mm prime vs 80mm prime.) Selfies distort your image because of the lens and the proximity of your face, but also varies with the angle and distant you hold the phone. Anyone that takes selfies regularly knows how to manipulate the angles to make your face appear various ways, the above and down method causes a distortion that infantilizes the subject; bigger forehead and eyes, tapering lower face (mouth, jaw, chin).

The reason mirror pictures are popular is because they distort your features less than a forward facing camera. 

The first time I played with an iPhone X in the store, I was impressed because they did something to make the images come out more true to what you experience looking in a mirror, which is generally how people view themselves (also why mirror selfies are popular.)

All of this is to say that perhaps Apple is, but it’s more of an attempt to look like how a professional photograph would as opposed to a janky forward facing cam."
"So I actually like bdsm a lot, and this is likely to be some what bias but from what I know pain and pleasure are actually quite linked, making it actually not such an odd thing for them to well be invoked together. 

1-2:
The next thing is bdsm is a massive catogory which is more than just pain in sex, so if you just mean enjoying pain sexually as well as giving pain sexually a better term is masochist and sadist, which I’m pretty sure are actually considered mental disorders. Even with these two words though they are often considered extremes in these areas. 

Next is that bdsm is often not sexual, the feeling one gets is very Quine. Bdsm is often kinda used in the same way mindfulness activities are used: it’s a way people like to forget about worry’s of stress buy either loseing control or gaining more control. It’s hard for me to explain this feeling it just is very satisfying and relaxing. 

3: 
Bdsm or at least M and S might be considered dangerous because either 1 the activities involved can seriously harm a person if not done right/with the right person or 2 because someone who is S might want to hurt people without consent, or someone who is M might really risk there life.  

It may be considered simlar to pedophilla because extreme S and M can cause people to do harmful things to others to seek out pleasure, or/also because both can be caused by extreme abuse in childhood.

4:
Causes for people who like bdsm are not really anything, I think if you more into it like I am you are a bit born with the love but someone who likes light bdsm can be very normal and just sometimes like control/ out of control aspect.  I’m pretty sure it’s more common to have a kink than to not, what ever that may be. Like I said before extreme cases of S or M may be caused by abuse but most people in bdsm are quite normal and mentally healthy. 

Inconclusion bdsm is not a disorder since well it’s a massive catogory and not one thing at all, but yes the enjoyment of pain (masochist)and seeing people in pain (sadist) to extreme levels are considered mental disorders. Also it should be noted people who do have any of these disorders (including pedophila) will probably seem normal to you and you would never be able to spot them out of a crowd.

I hope this kind helped even with my horrible spelling mistakes."
"Could you be having sleep paralysis? If you're not sleeping well, maybe when you think you're awake you're actually drifting in and out and it's causing the hallucinations and paralysis. 

I struggle with sleeping and feeling anxious at night, too. I got a dog and it really helped, and having white noise like a fan, table top water fountain, or something soothing like classical music on low works for me. If you're a person of faith, prayer can be really useful. If you were a kid, I'd suggest making [Monster Spray](https://www.prettyprudent.com/2011/01/baby-kid/monster-spray-2/). 

Also, idk if you're in treatment but have you tried [EMDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhaWIVK6ERI)? It's great for traumas.

"I always say: stuff happens for a reason. That was fate that those children were there, and the father too.

"I just began a new anti depressant and I feel the same way I am currently a sixth year college student and most my dreams go back about 6-8 years, in retrospect that is probably the time when my depression and anxiety really started affecting me, but it fucks with me like no other upon waking up "
"It's really hard. It's also sad to see how many people relate. I have good insight into my mental health because this is not the first time I have been through all of this but that insight has done nothing but hinder me. We are meant to be the ones who know ourselves best, so why are we ignored. "
I’m in a bad place right now and don’t have much to offer but I just want to give a virtual pat on the back cause I know the feeling all too well. It hurts so bad to feel alone and not have anyone to open up to. So bad. Wish I knew the right thing to say but I hope you find some comfort soon.
"I’ve been there, the biggest one while driving was imagining getting in an accident that would kill me so I wouldn’t have to do it myself.

Maybe try meditation and start looking into buddhism. I am just like you friend. It changed my life and helped my mind. Remain constant in a positive and good mindset and attitude. Thats how it taught me to become healthier and happier. Sometimes we have to try all the avenues. To see what works.
"Sure there is,but i think ive got like 3 mental illnessess.

One that i made a topic about,you can visit it.
""Is this a mental illness?"" is the name of it.

It really bothers me a LOT. Especially my studying and sleeping. 

Im sure my mom would listen if i could explain her whats wrong with me. 
"
"This was totally abusive. You describe manipulation, using shame/guilt as a weapon, and controlling. Name calling and demeaning too, making you feel 'not good enough'. People who love us don't hurt us like that. 

You may not know what a healthy relationship is, but I assure you, it's NOT that.  "
"You should tell a doctor about this. I have the same problem and I take Klonopin for it, along with melatonin. It helps a lot. 

If you don't want to or can't see a doctor for whatever reason, there are still some over the counter meds that could help you, like melatonin or Benadryl. 

Good luck!"
"jesus. is your mom like... a sociopath who gets off on making her children feel like shit..??

imagine if you told someone with some other illness, like cancer, that it was their own fault. it would be horrible. but for some reason when it comes to mental illness, people do this shit all the time"
"&gt; It's not really disturbing my life that much

Then you don't have a mental disorder ��. The key of a diagnosis isn't the symptoms you're having but the distress you're experiencing. If it's just a mild annoyance and it's not actually bothering you or interfering with your ability to function, there's no real issue. You're just kinda quirky.

Reading your ""symptoms"", there's not going to be many diagnoses that fits that. Aside from the mood swings, you just seem normal. But if you're really concerned, you should go to a licensed therapist."
"Finding the right therapist for you is half the battle.  They are only human.   I guess I kind of had the opposite reaction.  I  spilled wide open to pretty much all the therapists I had seen  and felt like I was getting nowhere.  But none of them were trauma therapists so  I was not addressing the  cause of my problems.  Whether it is CPTSD or PTSD, the important thing is that you process the trauma.  It won't go away on  its  own and will keep seeping out in all sorts of manifestations.  But it is the root.  I wish you a full recovery and peace."
"I have ADHD and yes that comes with a tonne of emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity. However I am also very aware of the damage I can do to others mental health. I would never ever ever urge a neurotypical to stay in a relationship with an ADHDer who is resisting diagnosis much less treatment. 

OPs only job is to protect her own mental health and not risk PTSD, anxiety and depressive disorders trying to ""save"" a man who doesn't accept he needs saving.

**Anyway, I think he sounds more like a cluster B personality disorder than ADHD**"
"I'm not sure how much help I can be, but I'll at least try.

Have you discussed all of this with your therapist?

Keep working with your medical team to see if the migraines can be brought under control.

Schedules and routines have always been helpful for me. Build in some down time where you just relax.

I can't help you on the phone calls, I can't do them. 

With pain, I've found that taking meds sooner rather than waiting till it's bad makes it easier to stay ahead of the pain.

Hopefully somebody else can give you more than that. Best wishes."
"&gt;c

Time to change counselor. 

In the meantime, read on mindfulness, gratitude, neuroplasticity and meditation to control intrusive thoughts. Those can be of help. 

When I was at my worst depression I had suicidal intrusive thoughts and those went away as soon as I started taking the anti depressant. Maybe all those thoughts are intrusive thoughts only. Maybe they stem from some other feelings. Maybe they started at some point you don't remember, but triggered them. 

I honestly think you need to change therapy person to someone else who might nail asking the right questions. Obviously counseling doesn't come as easy as getting an x-ray, reading the mind is more difficult, but different folks will approach stuff in different ways so it might be worth checking what another counselor will offer."
"I hear you. Your not alone! Focus on the positives. Talk to your husband. Find that common ground and remember that love you have for one another!! Do what you can around the house. The cat will be fine. YOUR GETTING YOUR MASTERS!!!!! Omfg thats incredible! Congratulations!! You did not come this far to be beaten down by life now. It can get better!! All that shit, is temporary and you have a great opportunity ahead of you!! I know its hard to see now, remain grateful for all you have. Get back to appreciating the little things. Your car, your home, your bed, your chairs and couches. Your clothes and pantry full of food. The running, clean water at your disposal. I know and understand the battles we all face in our pwn own life. Nonetheless make the necessary changes for the better!! You got this!!"
"I moved to US last year and I needed a job, so I got the first one that was offered to me - but it is something different than all my previous jobs, so I didn't like it that much. An year later, I still don't like it - I am waking up with the thoughts how much I don't want to go there.  I needed a change, so I applied for a different department. I will try something else, just to see if I am going to feel better on the new place. If it's not working, I think I am just going to keep searching for the job, that will actually makes me happy. Keep the search going, friend! Try new things (jobs, hobbies) and I hope you will find your thing that makes you happy! You can always message me, if you need to talk with someone. I am also a fellow gamer, so we might find something to play together :) Good luck!"
"I'm sorry about the lack of response. It's tough to communicate about this period, especially when your processing the diagnosis as well. My sister suffers as well and it is a very serious matter.

 I would try, and again it's try, to not be worried about people's responses, but that's easier said than done. I don't know what this means for you as a medical professional cuz I'm not one, however I would like to still help you process this event in your life. 

If that sounds like something you think could help please message me and we can be a little bit more private about this. If not, I totally understand and respect your space. I just want to reach out and begin a network.

Nonetheless, I'm sending a love and peace through this time of seeking the answers you need.

"ADHD is a genetic trait. It’s nobody’s “fault” even if you inherited it. The other disorders can come with ADHD, but it doesn’t matter what caused what. What matters happens between you and your therapist. Ignore what your mom says, she doesn’t seem to be feeling like being supportive."
"I can relate so much to this! What meds are you on? I am on vyvanse 30mg, and I feel productive in the day, and when I go to bed, I am equally brain tired and physically tired and I sleep better than I've ever did in the past 3 years.

I am so happy that you finally found meds that actually works!"
"I think that you should tell him how much you love him. Express your feelings to him as well as you can. Also, as much as it may feel like you should, don’t confront him. That won’t bring any help to him or you, if anything it will just upset him more, and we all know what that could lead to. "
"I think you have to be careful with that though. I used to work in the mental health field and knew a lot of people who would “therapist shop”. Not because they were bad people, but I think they wanted the perfect therapist, and that doesn’t exist because the perfect person doesn’t exist. "
"I'm by no means anti-meds, and I get what you mean. I will be on meds for pretty much the rest of my life for mental illness, and it does make me sad. I'm not this tired zombie you see, but neither am I the crazy woman that comes out without the meds. Its just a shitty draw of the cards sometimes."
"OP I’m sorry this happened to you, that sounds terrible. If it were me I would definitely be contacting them for more info on why they terminated with you. Also if she didn’t give you any referrals or give you any notice that seems unethical unless you maybe crossed her boundaries or whatever."
"Obligatory ""go see a therapist it sounds like social anxiety""

That really sounds horrible. I am kinda like this except it takes a little more to bring me down again, like a comment on my non-existent relationship and amount of friends that actually care about me.

Hope you find a solution for it "
Oh yes. It was like Neo after he discovers he's in the Matrix and is back in the Matrix for the first time. Or watching things in HD for the first time. Driving felt odd. Holding a pen felt unreal. But the loud noises and bright lights was the absolute worst. Construction noises drove me batshit.
"Regardless of whether there's some resentment in their tone or not, the advise I'm taking from this thread is to focus on me. Try to get me to the best I can be. That way, if she does come back, she's gonna get me at my very best. If she doesn't, I'm better equipped to deal with whatever's next. 
"
"So happy for you! I stopped drinking for 9 months and felt awesome! For some reason I started drinking a glass of wine here or there socially, then my good friends 30th Birthday was the other day. Man I remembered why I hate drinking so much. Definitely stopping for a while if not for good again! "
"Thank you very much. I thought I had OCD when I was younger because I have other weird compulsions (have to step 3 times in a sidewalk crack, have to flick lights 3 times, etc.) but I kinda just resigned myself to those being weird quirks. My hope is to see a psychiatrist fairly soon, thanks again"
"Yeah, I am looking for something new right now actually. It was difficult to look because:
1) I was too tired 
2) I was too depressed and would rather complain. I am now making it a priority to get out there - pronto. 

Things are bad, but I guess I have to keep going and not give up as you said. "
"You can't regulate stupidity. If not guns, they'd be using bow and arrows or darts. Or baseball bats. Should we make those things illegal?

I'm not even a gun owner. I just think ""blaming guns"" gets us nowhere. We need to fix what's wrong with people instead of taking away the tools."
"You'll know it's working if you can get out of bed and function, and overcome it's effect.  I had a really good experience with Seroquel.  Only problem is sleepiness.  If I could have got past that, I'd still be on it, since it helped a great deal with my symptoms.  Best sleep ever, I have to say."
"\*\*shrugs\*\* whattya gonna do? We all have something about us...mine is just fire. I won't burn you or anything. I promise. I stick to papers, paper towels, toilet paper, scraps of wood, etc. I am not dangerous--just mentally ill. I keep my fires small and tame so I don't hurt myself or others. "
"Haha yeah I used to bite my fingernails for years. Everyone thought it was anxiety. It wasn't. I just have oral fixation and I know it. I need to chew on something. Usually, unfortunately, it's food. Even if I'm full I continue to chew on things. I recently stopped biting my fingernails and I'm working on not eating tons of food (ironically, I'm a skinny bitch, I guess that's the perk to being a 19 year old boy haha) but, in turn, I've found myself rocking and fidgeting a LOT more.

Oh well. I guess chewing on my fingernails was another tick I had."
"Hello!

I do not have DID nor do I have any advice to you. However, I have recently started following this youtube vlogger who has DID and she &amp; her alters have posted many incredibly informative videos about DID, and some videos for people who recently discovered they have DID and how they can best help out their system. If you're interested, [her channel is here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6kFD5xIFvWyLlytv5pTR1w)

I don't know what else I can do to help, but I hope linking you to someone else with the same sort of history helps a bit."
"Honestly, FB sucks. There is tons of crap on there that is just judgemental and triggering. The ONLY reason I am on it is because I am in a special private Group and I have to be on there to participate.   


I don't go on Twitter much. Those are the only 2 social medias I go on...well...unless you count my YouTube channel. Ha. Stay away from social media if you can. It is toxic as hell now. There are lots of good people on there too, so I add them on Messenger (through FB) and talk to them that way if I need to. Good luck. This is JUST my opinion."
"I'm glad I could help! One of the biggest healing aspects for me has been in finding out proper scientific literature on the nature of these experiences, which has allowed me to ground them in objective reality properly rather than have them at the whim of my imagination.

It's good to know that these extremely alien and difficult to process experiences are nothing more than hiccups in the fascinatingly complex workings of the brain.

They can hang around and haunt you without a proper way to file them away. So it's all a healing process really. :)"
"My advice would be to see your own therapist. It sounds like a really tough situation and a little extra support might be helpful. A therapist would probably also be helpful in a type of situation like you’re in because they know so much about mental illnesses. 

I would not recommend listening to people on Reddit about medications to give him, but leave discussing that with medical professionals. Some psychiatric medications like haloperidol have extremely bad and sometimes permanent side effects and should really only be used as a last resort. "
"Wow that sounds so hard to deal with :( I'm sorry :( 

I think your idea to find someone covered under your insurance is a good idea. They can probably cover at least the therapy side. Maybe you could also consider seeing a psychiatrist if you think medication is worth a try? They can usually suggest medications that are unlikely to have the side effects that you've had previously. 

Either way it sounds like you're really struggling so I hope you find some support soon. You deserve to enjoy your life, not just struggle through it endlessly. &lt;3 "
"Hey there, take a deep breath and know that although this is a really challenging time, it will pass and become a faint memory. Good on you for reaching out for help. Your new school should have counseling/mental health services available to students for free. If you don’t know what they are or how to find them, PM me your school and I’ll try to help. How far away is your family? Can you give them a call or ask them to visit? Let people who care about you know what you’re going through—don’t try to get through this alone and don’t feel ashamed. What you’re going through is common and I’ve been there myself. Drink some water, have a bite to eat, try to get some fresh air/go for a short walk, etc. One day at a time, you’ll get through this and be stronger for it. Best of luck, mate. "
"Because people don't understand just how complex and different each mental illness can be. What works for one person might not work for another. And even though somebody might have depression or another mental illness, the symptoms and reasoning behind the grief can be very different from person to person.

Society's solution to mental health is often generic. You're given pills that are designed to ""help"" the patient. You're given therapy to ""talk"" about your problems. But what can they really say? A lot of times their words and advice are just the same things that you'll hear from anybody else.

Society often puts a stigma on mental illnesses. And their methods of ""fixing"" somebody aren't always effective. If somebody knows you're battling mental health issues, they want to make sure you're on medication. Or they want to be sure that you're seeing a therapist. But the reality is that unless your doctor knows exactly what you're going through, the solution you're given is going to be what's deemed appropriate to society. Whether it helps you or not."
"In times like these, when you run out of choices, go back to square one. Go back to simpler times, doing things that are not complex at all.

Do not rely on spontaneity. Create a plan/routine, no matter how unoriginal and how dull it may be. In this routine, include basic things you think normal people do. I'll give you some ideas:

* go to the gym or park. You don't have to work out. You could just change and walk on the treadmill for 10 mins watching a movie. You just have to get there.
* set a time for grocery shopping. You don't have to buy anything; just go there.
* set a time for the coffee shop, maybe in the morning or whenever you need the pick-me-up. just go there, you don't have to do anything.
* etc.

basically what I'm saying is make a routine where you go to places and prepare for them. You don't actually have to do anything. Just the simple act of going there is already half the process. You will get motivation. Start slow. Hell, start from doing absolutely nothing, as long as you go to places and stick to some sort of specific routine."
"Nutrition has a HUGE impact on mental health, especially depression.  Empty calories are going to cause you to have lack of energy, gaining weight can hurt your self image, too much sugar or caffeine can increase anxiety.


While what works for me certainly won't work for everyone, I can say that when I decided to change to a vegetarian diet (Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian) within even just about a week I felt a substantial increase in energy, started losing some unhealthy weight I had gained prior, and felt generally less depressed or stressed.  Of course I have to always make sure I'm getting plenty of protein, iron, and B vitamins, but overall it's been worth it for me physically and psychologically.  Probably the most beneficial aspect of being vegetarian wasn't even giving up meat and other animal products so much as much as it forced me to give up most of the fast food and a lot of other junk I was eating.  


You don't have to be a vegetarian to have a healthy diet, but making sure you're paying at least some attention to making sure you're getting enough of the nutrients you need while not filling yourself up with too much crap will have a huge impact on your mental health.  Same thing goes with making sure you're eating regular meals without going too long without eating or not over-eating too often.  "

You have a couple options for being self-pay. You could go to a clinic, where you might qualify for a certain number of free sessions with a psychiatrist or therapist, or sessions at a reduced rate. You can also ask any therapist in the US if they work on sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based. I've had psychiatrists who charge $100-175 per session. I've had regular therapists who charge up to 100, but anywhere from 25-65 if you're on sliding scale. Medication prices vary but if you use a discount card like [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/), many are inexpensive. I pay $3 for my anti anxiety meds. You can ask your doctor for generic. "
"You didn't answer my question. **WHAT WILL GET ME A GIRLFRIEND???**

&gt; What activities are you doing or are good at where you can meet ladies?

What do you think? All the normal things anyone would do. 

What is going to work? There are an infinite number of things that won't work. I could spend the rest of my life describing the things that haven't worked for me.

Like, what hobbies are going to get me a girlfriend? Why should I care about trivial hobbies when my life is effectively ruined by being denied what I most enjoy? This is where I'd bring it back to the concentration camp example to make my point clear: you interview this person and they say their whole family has been killed, they're being starved / worked to death, and they're constantly terrorized. It's pretty insensitive to suggest they take up a hobby.

&gt; Are you careful with your hygiene and have clean clothes? Keeping fit?

Sure. ... again, how much is enough? No one is perfect. 

You have a very transactional viewpoint. Like if I just put enough Self Improvement Coins into the Women Vending Machine then Sex will come out.

&gt; Can you start and hold a friendly conversation?

Sure. What are the magical words that will get me sex and a relationship? It doesn't work like that? OK .. then why tell me I need to work on my conversation skills. 

&gt; Do you have guy friends you go out with that can be a wing man?

Eh, I've had my fill of guy time, more or less. Will a ""wing man"" get me a girlfriend? If yes, then exactly how? If ""no"", it doesn't work like that, then it isn't really a solution and there isn't much of a reason for me to do it. 

If I could get what ACTUALLY WANT AND NEED TO SURVIVE, then I'll get that ""itch scratched"" and I can move down to other items on my priority list, like hobbies, exercise, and non-sexual friends. "
"Also I never feel vulnerable. Ever, really."
"Aw, thank you for that. That was beautiful."
Could you move in with your brother maybe??
Do you wanna tell me why you feel this way?
Good for you! I wish you the absolute best!

Thank you for responding. I might ask them.

"Ah that's pretty insightful, thank you so much :) I'm glad to hear you get to see your psychiatrist that often , I often wondered if inpatients do. It sounds like the private hospitals/clinics offer a great environment as far as psychiatric care environments can go. I really appreciate your message"
DBT.  It changed my daughters life.  For a long time we didn't have a diagnosis and that was ok- the bottom line is just that you get help so you feel better.  Think of a diagnosis as one more component that your therapist/psychiatrist can use to help you feel better.  Do not let it define you :)
"His poor wife...

Also yeah I agree it is unreal how ignorant people are to mental health.

I have so many stories I want to mention from my job but I don’t feel like getting into all of that now maybe I’ll edit this later and add some, maybe not. i’m honestly just exhausted thinking about it"
I attend a support group that has people aged 24-50 and the mix of ages is one of the things I really appreciate about going there - young people are likely to have their mental health conditions dismissed and it's not helpful to be limited to other 20somethings for practical advice all the time...
"I use to do the books for a senior living arrangement.  They left in one of two ways:  Either feet first (dead) or their kids put them in old  folks homes when they kept saying that the ""little people"" who lived under the house were stealing things from them.  Its the way of all flesh, I am afraid."
It could be some form of anxiety. Especially the way you feel about yourself. Otherwise it sounds like what most teenagers go through with hormones and mood swings. Tell your parents and maybe ask to see a psychologist or therapist if it will make you feel better or help you sort out your emotions.
"It's hard to say. Is it bad enough to ruin your day on a constant basis? If so, then you need to go see a doctor. He will get you on the proper medicine and you might start feeling better. You also have the option to go to therapy which will help you get these negative emotions out of your system. "
"I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. You mentioned wanting someone to cuddle until you calm down. I totally get that. Something to think about is the possibility of getting an emotional support animal. If your care coordinator isn’t helping you cope, they can at least help you figure that out."
"Losts of hugs for you!!!  I'm feeling something similar. It may not be the best comfort, but there are people out there like you, going through parts of their lives that they're dealing with something.  Some may be perceived as big, some may be perceived as small, but they all matter just like you."
"I dont know if this helps, but these labels only really help mental health teams tell insurance companies so that you are covered. People with mental health issues exist on a spectrum. No one person fits a diagnosis perfectly. I have BPD ""traits"" and OCD ""tendencies"". Its possible that you do exist on a spectrum of being a psychopath. Or possibly something else

What really matters is what you do about it. If this is something you really want to address, you are already on step one. You would need a little more help from a therapist to reach step 2."
I feel the same way. I guess you just have to keep on looking for something that excites you or are really passionate about. I don’t think there is anything wrong with your mindset it is just reality really. I often feel those that are positive are either completely delusional or have been through a lot and finally found their meaning. People who say they are ok aren’t necessarily either. Not everyone is willing to admit all their darkness. Have a read of ‘the good life’ and if you haven’t already ‘the subtle art of not giving a fuck’
"As I'm no expert (and no personal experience) I feel obliged to tell you that you should seek help by an expert or at least from people around you.

My first thought reading you message is that slowing down or holding still isn't unproductive. There is an old saying ""you have to *go slow* in order to *go fast"".* So by slowing down or taking breaks, don't think of it as not doing something, think of it as ordering your thoughts, planning and reflecting on what went well and what didn't.

Meditating also helps in that regard, there are youtube videos that talk you through whole sessions.

Are there specific things you are anxious about? You can also PM me if you don't want to share in public. I will however go to bed soon (because it is late here), so I might not answer for several hours.

&amp;#x200B;"
"That’s the lie we are all fed. I also grew up barely scraping by. I also feel like I need to make a lot of money, but for a complete different reason. 
I agree with your view and I’m happy you understand that making money for happiness isn’t true. I want financial security so that I can give my family the freedom to live the life they want. For me, i don’t care how hard the work is as long as I can see my mom relax and my sibling cry less about life. I want them to travel, to play music, go out with friends, etc. 

I’m tired of seeing others living a sad existence because they’re stuck doing things they do not want to be doing. Keeping that In mind, it makes me happy to give some freedom to my family. 

Do what makes you happy! Understand your purpose for doing things and good luck ��"
"I am not a mental health expert at all. 

However this mirrors what happened to a close family friend aged  17. Overnight she started thinking she could smell cigarette smoke and an sprayed an entire can of body spray in the car (none of us are smokers). She then started saying she had to go to a non existent party a neighbour was throwing for her across the road. Kept trying to get out at 3am to this party. Then she packed a bag of bricks to go to Africa and help build a new library over there. She kept trying to go to the airport with this bag of bricks and her parents locked the house down. 

She was diagnosed with bipolar and was unwell for a long time. My sister supported her a lot and walked her to college and back and made she was wasn’t nervous or encountered triggers. Her trigger seemed to be splitting with a long term bf and starting at a new college - the stress sparked the bipolar. She’s on medication now and doing amazingly - you’d never know! 

Just a thought it might be something similar? Best of luck. I hope your sister is okay. "
"Thank you SO much! 

This was helpful! I definitely think the boundary thing is useful. 

The hardest part for me is I DO feel like I take responsibility for myself... I’m an internalizer so I’m constantly trying to figure out my role in EVERYTHING, and what I can do to change and how my actions caused things, and how I can fix it... so to hear that I’m “not doing anything” when I feel like I’m working my ass off to make progress, well... that really really sucks. 

I *hate* blaming other people and situations for my feelings, but honestly I feel much better about myself when I’m not at home and/or not around my parents. When I’m at home or around them I feel anxious and in the back of my mind I’m always on my toes or preparing for them to be mad at me for something. It sucks and I know I can’t change them. 

I want to adopt a “fuck their opinion about me” attitude to protect myself... but given the nature of the situation (parents, still live at home) I’m afraid that would make things worse. 

Thank you for your response!!! "
"I suspect your main problem right now is ""health related anxiety"" you are convinced something is wrong with you, and this is making you ill due to worrying. Doctors would spot via blood tests anything major that would be responsible for ""declining health"" you are 18 years old, no way your health is declining unless you have a major issue rearing its head.

The most valuable thing I could for you right now is going to be really difficult, but it is absolutely the most important thing for my ongoing health and something I absolutely wish I had taken more seriously at your age: Diet and exercise. 

Your feeling of ""declining health"" could well be a feeling of declining fitness, has your life become more sedentary recently?

Committing some time to a sport or regular exercise has so many benefits its beyond the scope of this post to even list I'll try to summarize a few.

First off, its a distraction, a focus such on getting fit enough to run a half marathon or deadlift 200kg or winning a team sports game is an objective you can focus on and work towards, instead of sitting at home worrying about ""declining health"".

Cardio such as running is fucking amazing for a release of endorphins it's like a high that's good for you, team sports get you out of the house and meeting new people, working with others as a team is very, very good for our ape brains. Strength training such as powerlifting will increase your testosterone levels, making you feel better (sense of wellbeing) gives you more energy and a myriad of other benefits.

Hopefully this has been helpful."
"If you consider your thoughts as they're naturally happening, you'll find that most of the time you're thinking of what has happened or what will happen. Constantly being focused on the past and present can lead to a bad spiral of worry and doubt.

Set a timer for three minutes. Sit or lay comfortably. Breathe steadily and deeply: 4 seconds in, 3 seconds held, 8 seconds out. Or some comfortable variation of that. This does two things: forces you to focus on your breath and stops you from thinking about the past or the future. The short hold in the middle there helps your lungs get a little extra oxygen and expel a little extra CO2. This can help to dispel anxiety and panic right away: just breathing through the lump in your throat can dispell darkening cloud. 

You'll mess up and start thinking about something that happened yesterday and start breathing faster and it's okay. Forgive yourself, let it go, breathe in, hold, and out, repeat. It's important to forgive yourself and let it go. Part of the process is learning how to be self-forgiving and patient. 

There are a lot of different kinds of meditation and more ways to practice it, but there's no right or wrong way to do it as long as you're mindfully in the present moment. Some people have a mantra, some enjoy Tibetan singing bowls in the background, some people go for a walk and count their steps and their breath, some people just close their eyes for a minute in the car before going in to work.

Lots of good info online! If you're interested in the science of it, Buddha's Brain is an amazing read."

"Ah, dissociation. That rings a bell. I've been bullied (*verbally &amp; metally, not physically*) about a year ago, so that might be a part of the cause.

"But what if I’m already living a miserable, miserable life. My family doesn’t care for me, I have no friends anymore. No one talks to me at my job and I suck at conversation. I have no interests, no hobbies, no positivity left. I hate people. Life isn’t even real so why be a slave any longer?!"

"I hope as well. I needed to see a professional a decade ago. Sadly no one, not even my parents or teachers could see that. Ah well.

I wish I had an idea of why this was happening to you but I really think you need to see a doctor very soon. If this has been going on for two years your body can’t handle that. Please go see someone and let them try and figure out if this is mental or physical because you can’t live like that.
I'm in the same situation. Had brain scan and psychiatrist said there is nothing clinically wrong with me. Nothing they can treat. Go home and try not to kill yourself. I keep going to the GP when it's bad and keep going round in circles. I don't know what to suggest but it's not easy to deal with.
I’m sorry that I’m not too familiar with how the mental health system works in the UK but I’d recommend getting connected to a therapist where you could do weekly therapy sessions.  I’ve heard the wait lists can be long over there but all the more reason to get on the list sooner than later.

Right now I have them every single night and have for months. If im lucky, il forget them in a couple minutes of waking up. However this week i remember them all. They are ruining my life"
"The Moon and the sky. It's always so beautiful, especially at the end of a stormy day with the brightness of the moon peeking through the rushing clouds. Has anyone else looked at the stars while laying down and felt like you were falling into and away from it at the same time? I love the night sky!"
"You are in a good place. In 4 weeks, things will return to normal IF you follow through with treatment.

"so i have a question....
i was placed in a pysch ward, but it was with consent that i went. i was told once im 18 my record will be cleared since it was not a ""302""
im looking into the air force when im 18... will i be accepted or will my mental health fuck a good thing up like everything else? lmao"
"I have warned friends about doing this (I am a survivor of two attempts in the not-so-distant past--3 years ago) and I have blocked people for not being more sensitive. I don't need assholes like that in my life. All I asked this one person was to cut down on the memes having to do with suicide. I didn't ask him to STOP, just cut down because it was hurting me and reminding me of a not-so-good time in my life. He knows about my past. :( Maybe you should start blocking people or unfollow them (on FB) or hide their posts permanently (on FB)? Good luck."
"OK I have been through this. I have major depressive disorder. I saw a psychiatrist to adjust medication. There are so many medications out there it took over 6 months to find the right medication for me. It sounds like you are taking the same medication and only the dosage is being adjusted for you, is that correct? If that's the case, find a different physician to put you on the best medication for you! I had been through several different ones until I was on the right combination. It can be frustrating. Hang in there. There's hope. Don't give up. "
"I think you should tell your counselor about your violent thoughts, but also your fear.  Your counselor can work with you on that fear of losing impulse control.  And your counselor can always assess you each session for whether you act impulsively in the session to help gauge if that was ever a real threat.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I worked as a counselor and I don't think you are in enough danger to warrant any additional worry.  You don't act on these violent images you have, and you clearly don't intend to.  From my time working on crisis hotlines, I've found suicidal and homicidal people tend to plan out the act and fantasize a lot about it before hand, then there is a phase where they start putting into motion their plan by doing things like giving away their stuff, writing notes, buying the weapons, ect...  


You just don't sound anywhere near the breaking point yet.  But I say tell your therapist about it (and your lack of intend to act on it) and you two together can talk about when you are at the breaking point should it ever get that bad."
"What kind of therapy have you gone to? I am currently going through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which basically teaches you to change the way you think for the better. 

Irritability and anger could be a symptom of many different things, and I don't know your story or situation so I won't make any interjections.

Do you have anyone currently you could talk to, whether about advice getting help?

Another thing is that we cannot directly affect our emotions, they are a result of our state of mind. You shouldn't beat yourself up for having your emotions.I understand that it is easier said than done, especially when the emotions are very strong, and I find myself doing that all the time even though I logically know I should not. 

Its hard for me to relate to people not understanding you because I have always had a support network in my family and friends, but I do know that is brings on a feeling of terrible isolation and loneliness, which I have experienced before, though under different circumstances. 

I wish you the best and I hope you find your way"
"If you have mental illness you won't be ""cured"" just like someone with autism can't be ""cured"" but you can gain the skills to work with and cope with your illness. Therapy is incredible if you find the right therapist who is a good fit for you, but you also have to put in the work. If you want change, change happens with you.

Also in terms of grad school, I was in my last year of undergrad and so depressed, anxious, and dissociative its incredible I managed to graduate. But I was applying for grad schools cause it was the next step for me into being a counselor. I felt all this weight and pressure to go right into it that I didn't consider taking a year off to take care of myself. Once I finally acknowledged that I'm allowed to say ""no"" to grad school, I felt a HUGE weight off my shoulders and soul.

So if you're crying every day because it's a lot of stress that's one thing, but if you're crying because deep down it doesn't feel like you should be there, but you've forced yourself to stay, that's another thing. Definitely seek out a counselor where you go, they should have free counseling. Tell them it's urgent and they'll get you in quick. Also talk to a career counselor about everything and whether it's OK to take a break and come back to that grad program. You CAN talk to people! They want to help!"
"It's not harsh, you're right. After last year I had to move out of my previous apartment due to some possible health hazards there. For lack of other options I moved home for the summer then had to find a new place for the next year, and she quit her job at about that time, so she just decided that she was moving up here and I was going to move in with her and help with rent for the remainder of my time in school here. Admittedly, that was my mistake. I struggle with standing up for myself, which I'm sure played no small part in getting me into this position, so I just went along with it.

It is heartbreaking to see her like this. Growing up she was the kindest, most loving person you'd ever meet. Now she's just bitter and mean all the time. I miss who she was. I understand that I've enabled her up until this point, and I shouldn't have.

I'm kind of stuck for the next year unless I can convince her to get help, but then I have to move for school again, and I will be making sure she is not coming with me.

Thanks for your concern, but my health is really fine! I realize theres probably some issues there from dealing with all of this, but they're not significant enough to bother me right now, so I'll deal with them when they arise. I'm really just stressed, and I was unsure of what kind of options I had."
"Yes! I absolutely relate to your questions/experiences! Once I started seeing a therapist and realizing that I wasn't necessarily using my time to the full potential, I wanted to work on the same things as you. 

For starters, I've started writing down a list of things that I know I should talk about. Just a brief phrase to sum up each topic, and I've given the lists to my therapist so that she can bring the topics up, and she does so very gently as a good therapist would. It makes it a lot easier to talk about things that are hard to just lay out on the table in conversation. 

Secondly, I've brought up CBT and different approaches that I'm interested in to my therapist. I basically told her that I did my research and that I'd like some help with sticking with CBT/other techniques. I told her I bought a workbook (there are a lot on Amazon), and that I wanted to jump into it but I just haven't made it a priority outside of my therapy time. 

We talked about CBT and walked through a couple things I can do each week to incorporate it. Basically, every week, we make a goal at the end of our session for me to practice CBT/other techniques before I see her next. 

That's how I've overcome some things! The right therapist is great, especially if you give them some direction on the things you want to work on. "
"Find some way to not think about them in your consciousness. Distract your brain from these thoughts and allow other, equally important thoughts to come to the surface. The more you focus on one thought, the more other things get blocked up underneath. This means that the thought occupying your mind can take on a life of its own, as it decontextualises - you're so focused on X that you forget about A, B &amp; C. When you allow everything to rise to the surface in a calm and relaxed way, you can see the bigger picture and not blow things out of proportion.

So the tricky part is learning to distract yourself. It's the same usual suspects that help with this:

* Meditate. Try guided meditation aimed at anxiety (as always I recommend Headspace for this, but only because I can personally vouch for it)
* Exercise. I hate running but I love the fact that I can let my thoughts run free when I'm doing it. No thought lasts more than a few seconds and they're all sugar-coated in dopamine. It really helps to get everything processed
* Sleep. A good night's rest does wonders for a chaotic brain
* Eat well. Make sure your body has all the tools it needs to function healthily, since your brain is a part of your body. Make sure you have all the vitamins and minerals your body needs
* Talk. Thoughts echoing around inside your head are very different to thoughts that you vocalise to somebody else. It's too easy to have conflicting thoughts without even realising it if you keep them inside. Saying them aloud puts them through a filter that gives them much more context

These all work for me. It's still tough and it's not always easy to achieve all (or any) of the above, but these are the things you should aim for to help you avoid getting stuck in loops inside your own head.

Feel free to message me if you want to chat. :)"

What ""mindset"" should replace it? You're saying they'll instantly want to fuck me? Where's your proof? I had a different ""mindset"" before and it didn't get me anything, and that's what lead me to where I am now."
Agree wth the comment made.. perhaps your parents were judgmental growing up or very critical of your actions or set high expectations during your childhood leading you to become very anxious and worried about your parents reaction because you feel like you would disappoint? Sorry I don't make sense
"As somebody who suffers from paranoia, I'm going to tell you right now that you need to go see a doctor. I never did when I first started having these thoughts and it only got worse as time went on. Get yourself onto prescribed medication and go see a therapist. You'll feel better later on if you do."
Before it I was an utter mess. If been struggling for months with an increasing level of suicidal thoughts and crying fits. In the past two weeks I've barely thought about suicide... So it's working on some level. It's just not helping the anxiety. I'm having fortnightly check ins with my GP though.
"Here’s a book called The Mindfulness workbook for OCD”. I didn’t read the whole thing, but there’s a section near the beginning called “The Broken Dam” that helped me understand my thoughts better.

"I don't know how to find a good therapist. Mine is nice but I don't seem to be able to communicate what is bothering me and i dont feel like we're doing anything in therapy. As far as finding another, most therapists in the bible belt are coming from a religious standpoint, and I am not. So i'm lost."
"I think I feel the same way, but can you give me an example?

&amp;#x200B;

Like - a past experience of deja vu that you vividly remember because it tripped you out so much?

&amp;#x200B;

Also are you a dreamy person? I find I have precognitive dreams and then have deja vu based off of those dreams."
"I would say that it's posible to be cured, so there is no symptoms. But it's still leave some kind mark in your head. It's so big part of life, that in my experience I would say it's chaining something rest of your life. Maybe even not anything bad, but so dramatic experience leaves something behind."
Look at the comments to your posts as people taking to you instead of just words on a screen. That goes to show that there are good people out there willing to extend a hand. Forget your past and reach out to good people for your future. Find comfort in being with others who want to see you succeed.
"Oh yes, you are right. He was right in suggesting that. I was just hoping that maybe he could at least offer some comfort, but his expression and apparant shock at what I was telling him was quite...disheartening. :) NO worries. You did fine and I appreciate the reply. \*huuuuugzzzzzz\*

"Ok, a few questions:

1. When did E start having these problems?

3. What do you think is causing this?
4. Has there been any changes in E's life? 
5. Has he completed puberty?  
6. Did he always have mental health issues?"
"Sending hugs to you. Sometimes this crap makes NO sense. I don't have it all that bad either, yet I had wanted to (in the past) kill myself. I understand what you mean. Please talk to someone about this. You need to get it out and maybe someone can help you ease your mind. Take care and good luck. :)"
This is cliche but do you meditate? Bc that’s a way of building up awareness of your thoughts and the capability to be aware of when you lose focus from the present moment. It’s not easy and it takes regular  repeated sessions to feel the benefit but it’s worth it. It’s exercising your brain.
"Yeah in some ways. I can't stand the sounds of coughing, sneezing, clearing throat etc. It drives me insane to the point where I wear noise cancellation headphones whenever I have to leave my room.

You should see both a doctor and a therapist. If not, things will probably only continue to get worse."
I have been on lithium and I did not get better my psychiatrist gave up on me. I live in a rural area and transportation is a problem. So in terms of medical care I'm out of option. And i have no help from anyone for my son and I've tapped into all the available resources that could help. I'm tired. My son would be better with a structured family that has the stamina to raise him. I've been through alot and i know there are people worse off but I'm in mental agony. I have an ounce of faith it may get better but I'm starting to believe I'm delusional.
"Avoid trying to reassure her because she just can't hear you right now. Instead, try to validate the struggles and worries that she is feeling without immediately trying to fix them. Just feeling supported does wonders. If you can back off the reassurances for a while, it also might make her more likely to hear a small reassurance or two down the line and actually take it seriously. Right now, the frequent reassurances are just noise to her, and no doubt she is brushing them off.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to encourage therapy, focus on how you would like to see her happier and less stressed, not on how she can fix the body dysmorphia. Acknowledge your limited ability to make her feel better and suggest that a professional may feel more useful than her boyfriend at trying to make the situation better. "
"But the only way out is to solve my issues which is impossible given that I feel like this and by my own experience and it's just a vicious cycle. I'd better hope I fix my issues soon as I'm about 2 years in too... I just want my life to be as good as before with nothing plaguing me to the point of pure sadness, I got so sad and felt so defeating thinking about this stuff during my martial arts class a few months ago that I channeled it and completely overpowered someone probably twice to thrice as strong as I am, just saying that to give some context on how bad it makes me feel sometimes.. I also feel incredibly unlucky as nobody else I've ever seen irl has similar issues, so I'm just sat there thinking ""Why me!? Why does nobody else suffer from anything, why am I so worthless, hopeless and unlucky.""."
"For me it was extremely sedating.  2 hours to get dressed in the morning.  Like swallowing a handful of benedryl.  I kept reducing the dose (on the doctors instructions)  till I was taking half of the smallest dose (25 mg),  which was way below therapeutic level.  I can't really describe the feeling though it was just awful.   Like severely tired with a thick layer of ick and crud all over you. And it made me depressed to be that sedated.  I have read that it is used in prison in order to sleep the sentence away.   And it was given to my dad when he had psychotic episodes with his dementia.  Off label and illegal,  but it gave him some rest.  Do not drink alcohol with it.

Then again,  it has worked for some people.  I believe you start out at a low dose and build up to a therapeutic level.  Good luck."
"Thanks for posting this.

If I may, though: I'd suggest the 20% is actually even lower. Even things like effort and the quality of decisions are based on factors of birth and upbrinding -- it's not like we choose to have a particular level of motivation, for example. This is not to say that we have no control over anything or should not bear responsibility for our actions. But our basic nature is something we don't have control over. 

Much suffering is caused by comparing oneself to others, something that society encourages, especially with respect to ""success,"" which is usually defined in financial or material terms. 

But yes, giving yourself a break is really critical to any form of progress. For those who were raised to be blamed for things on a regular basis, this can be a tough knot to untangle."
"I can relate.  At times when I've worked I've had to move my alarm clock's face away from my bed, so I would stop opening my eyes, reading the numbers, and doing math to see how much less sleep I'm going to get.

Try reminding yourself when you are in bed that you are still resting and recharging even if you are awake in bed.  I've spent entire nights laying in bed with my eyes closed all the way until my alarm went off, and I was still able to function during the day better than I would be if I had got out of bed and been active that whole time.

Really, you're just telling yourself that you're already resting so your active brain will consider the problem ""solved"" and give you a break.  There's never going to be a time when you think to check if you are sleeping and you find that you are.  It's like a watched pot never boils.  You got to get your brain thinking of some fantasy, or rehashing some memory, something other than worry for you to sleep.

Another technique is to mentally go through your whole day while laying in bed.  Like try to remember everything you can from when you first woke up, what you ate, what you said or thought, and every little moment of your day.  Remembering stuff doesn't wake you up the way worrying does, so half the time you fall asleep before you are done with the exercise."
"One of the best things you can do is, if there is one available, join a local group for people who are supporting someone with a mental health problem. It will provide resources and support for supporting her. If you cant do this physically, look for something similar online. It will help.

I am a consumer, and my wife is my main support. She is fantastic, and I am incredibly lucky. I guess things she does well, include; 

regularly invites me to talk (and listens)

gets me talking even when I dont feel like it (personally this is helpful, not for everyone)

gets me to go out for walks every day - when you are ill getting regular exercise can take a dive and be hard to do. For me, the ""come on, we're going out"" call is really helpful. Again, not for everyone. 

Gets it when I am irritable (We have a system now - I tell her when I feel a mood coming on, and that way she knows that if I am being a shithead, its about the mood, and not about her). She knows to give me a wide birth when Im like this, anddoesnt take it erpsonally when I am being a dick. 

Is incredibly forgiving and accepting about the fact its really hard for me to socialise sometimes, and lets me not go out when Im not well. 

Keeps an eye on my appointments and makes sure I get to the various commitments that help me maintain my health - ie doctor, shrink, volunteering, group, etc. 

There's probably a lot more. I guess you get the idea. 

It cant be easy for you and I respect that you are sticking by her and want to help. You sound like a great person and I bet she's pretty awesome too :)

"As a person that has a mental illness, I can tell you do it before it gets worse. I held it back for years, then one day I just snapped. I would recommend talking to your closest friend or the one you trust the most then slowly open up. It's not easy until you just let your wall down; piece by piece. "
"Don't fight it. Give yourself permission to feel everything that is in you. The good, the bad, embrace it all. Let yourself express the pain and sorrows you hold inside :( I always make myself cry harder than I need to by watching touching/sentimental videos on youtube, i feel sooo much better after. "
"First, don't be embarrassed just because you don't have the same will as someone else.

"Honestly she's going to just have to toughen up and move through it if she wants to continue going to that gym.

"How did you find peace of mind after battling with your issues? Im in a tough place right now, you can check out my last couple posts to see what im going through. I guess I just don't see a way out of pain and suffering, and I was hoping you might have some insight as to how to get to a better place."
"I get like this too. You should aside 1 hour every day to ""cool down"". In this time, take a shower and drink something warm. This really helps me recover from spikes of irritability. I know it's cliche, but recharging especially after working is SO important.
Congrats on your promotion and good luck !"
"If you're mom's a psychiatrist, she probably understands that it's totally okay for people to ask for help, or simply just want someone to talk openly with. It's different talking to a professional vs. talking to friends, they're separate worlds. Hope your parents will be supportive and encouraging ! "
Take notes. Then focus on one thing you want to change. For example you want better grades give yourself an hour a day every day to study. Write down when you do and when you don't  and aim to do better. A little improvement is better than none at all.  And keep in mind that you only fail if you stop.

"If there's anyone who can explain it, either have it or is a specialist and have done research.

I am also unable to express affection or emotions of any kind i have to fake everything and its really tired i wasn't like this a couple of years ago i was completely normal.

I have also been diagnosed with bipolar ll and anxiety disorders but this is only because i have periods of high energy and not sleeping or sleeping to much. I have been ruled out of autism. 

The annoying part is everyone tells me i either dont care about anything or that im a robot."
"Molly was originally developed in hopes of treating mental health symptoms, but during testing they realized it was not a viable treatment for MH.  I think part of this is because it floods your brain with all your serotonin / neurotransmitters, so you feel like absolute ass the next day.

Drugs seem like they help youd symptoms, but in the long run they often make them worse.  There is no good substitute for professional mental health treatment. I'd recommend finding a counselor and a psychiatrist to manage medication before I'd advocate for drug use."
"When you start to regularly give of yourself in practical ways, you will inevitably find at least a couple friends/acquaintances who don't appreciate you. You might find you don't like them anyway.
The saying ""There is more joy in giving than there is in receiving"" actually has merit. When you give of yourself and your efforts are thought out and directed in practical ways, you give out of love. That is a feeling that cannot be equalled even by receiving love from someone else. Nobody can take it away from you.....even those that take advantage of you."
"You see, you are asking leaders to do something. Those in power benefict from the status quo so they aren't interested in people well beign.

"
"Yeah, you're not a reason, you're an excuse. See, by putting all of this on you, he's trying to absolve himself of the guilt he feels over making this decision. If you say no, he can do whatever he wants and blame you for it, if you say yes he can still do whatever he wants and he's also exercising control over you.

Best thing you can do, if you really care about him, is get him committed. These issues are not going to fix themselves and if he is serious enough to trap and attempt to emotionally manipulate you, he's going down a dark path.

Chances are, he's not actually suicidal and he's doing this to manipulate you. Sounds like some toxic masculinity to me. Sorry to paint your friend with an ugly brush, but he's abusing you by doing this, whether he's serious or not.

Sounds like a classic ""niceguy""."
"ZZ CREAM OR XINFUMANLING THIS THINGS CURES MINE.

Im saying OR because Im not sure which one works, (I use them together) it kills mites on my face. I have been having rosacea and cystic acnes for more than 3 years. after trying numerous product and lasers which did little to nothing to me. thank God i found zz cream. redness is decreasing, broken capillaries reduced, bumps are reducing, very little new acne, active acne is healing, scars are getting shallower and reduced. the company that sells this recommend 4 months for maximum result, i been using it for 1 month and it worked like wonder. it just getting better and better overtime my face complexion (including acne, redness and scars) have improved about 70% by now. forehead is 90% perfect, nose is 60%, chin is 70%, cheeks is 60%, upper lips is 80% improved to perfection. i just wish i found it sooner, but i believe that my acne scar will be gone 99% by 4 months (including scar). I AM ONLY WRITING THIS BECAUSE I PROMISE MYSELF THAT IF ANYTHING CURED OR HELP ME FROM ACNE AND ROSACEA I WOULD POST THIS."
"That's really rough, I'm very sorry to hear that. It sounds like you know that you're going to fight through this and I think that's the most important thing for you. Just let all of this happen and believe that it will get better eventually.

I can tell you that grief comes in stages. Over two years later I'm still realising things for the first time and it hits me like a ton of bricks. It's really hard. So don't put any pressure on yourself to feel a certain way.

I also know the feeling of seeing all your loved ones impacted by suicide and knowing you couldn't do that to them. That in itself can feel like an overwhelming amount of pressure, but try to hold on to that anyway.

Whatever you do, don't feel guilty about being selfish. This will likely be the most traumatic thing that you will live through. It's a catastrophic event and you are entitled to do whatever you need to do to help you get through it. People will understand.

My heart really goes out to you. If you want to unload anything to a stranger, feel free to message me any time. Sounds like you have good friends but the offer is there regardless.

Take care and take one day at a time. It does get better, even if some days feel like a step backwards. In time it will get easier, and you should feel no guilt whatsoever for having a ""good"" day."
Alright. Well I hope everything works out then.
Are you seeing a doctor or therapist right now?
"Congrats Tea.

Here's to many more ����"
Congratulations! We're all super proud of you!
Do you have any sort of blackouts or time loss?
"Go to the Doc, get treatment, keep your family."
Great thank you! I didn’t think of that site
Have you had a serious talk with her about it?
I am telling you the truth. Sticks and stones.
I despise every self help thing for some reason
"I prefer ""how's it goin?"" Response: ""what's up"""
If you're in need of someone to talk to im here
It makes me so sad how much I relate with this.
Jesus really kicked the chair on this one tbh.
"Keep going to therapy, and discuss this issue. "
"No,im pretty sure one of my brothers has this.
"
"On the bright side, everything is great again. "
Poorly worded and feels like a phishing scam.
See a doctor!!! Parents don't always understand
Sound like you are just an adjusted introvert.
"Talking is a good start, we are here to listen
"
"Thanks, the dark star is not so dark after all."
That's a very good tip thank you so much ��

Yep. Just do the little things. It should help.
You should seek medical help if you haven't yet
You're welcome. Message me if you ever need to.
You’ll be ok it’s not as much as you think
he right tho. I'm jelly af. hate that darn guy!
"i do try, we end up getting into a huge fight. "
"As far as I know it is common for people that have experienced trauma to feel like it hasn't impacted them at all. Once you start working on it with a good therapist, the way you feel about certain things can change. But then there's someone there to help you with that. I'd give it a shot in any case. "
"Emotional numbness and staying constantly busy with work or side projects. Drinking will make it worse, as do hard drugs. Get out into nature once in a while, clear the head. Distance yourself from the trauma, physically and emotionally. Go through the stages of grief and learn to be kind to yourself. "
"I do something similar: I put my earbuds in and listen to loud music. It is sometimes the only way to stop the ""voices"" (It is not actual voices but more like my thoughts being very loud) and stop the urges/compulsions I have. Sometimes it does not work, and I end up giving in. I can so relate to this."
"I just want to say thank you to everyone checking this out. I've been delighted to see the views go up on this and the response... whooo... getting a little moist in the ol' oculars just thinking about it. Much Love and Infinite Mojo to you if you're reading this, and even if you aren't. #StayInTheGame"
"I'm 20, male

&amp;#x200B;

I'm already attending therapy and my psychologist knows about the hallucination, she insisted I tell her by email or call if it ever happens again because it was over so quickly I am not even sure anymore. I know my reaction was real, but I don't know if I even saw anything."
"I'm not a psychologist, and I can't presume to know what you're going through. The VA and vet centers both offer nonmedical counseling, and military one source might also be of use. 

Mental health is complex. The VA has pretty decent mental health services in my opinion. Whatever it is, they can help."
"Quick question, and this is open to anybody: 

In terms of getting a diagnosis, have you gotten multiple opinions and how do you go about it. Do you have to have multiple sessions with a therapist to get a diagnosis? What’s the process like because I’d like to get at least three different opinions."
Some people might benefit from being taken out of their comfort zone by having a challenging dynamic in the relationship with their therapist.  But other people never had a comfort zone for their whole life and are only ready to make steps forward after they’re 100% comfortable with their therapist.
"That’s a good question.  I originally got the prescription for hypersomnia and when I told my therapist the other benefits he was like “oh that happens with some people , we will keep you on it”. I would maybe bring it up in the way of helping with focusing and hearing compulsive thoughts less.  "
"Then it does sound like it could be bpd, but I'm not a doctor. Lots of symptoms can often be from other (mental) illnesses too so never just assume. It's better to get help early on though, then you've got a better chance at healing. Hopefully for you it isn't bpd. I've got it and it's not fun. At all."
"WTF dude. I don't think you understand depression at all. Depressed people would love to do anything other than being depressed but the depression takes all your energy, all your desires, all your dreams and makes them seem so far away you can't even remember having them. Your advise is condescending. "
"Well acknowledging that you are overthinking is a great step. 

Something that helps me is to schedule time to worry/overthink. From 5-6pm, I can do the whole overanalyzing and self pitying routine. But after that, it’s over. It helps. Distracting yourself with things that make you happy also works! "
"Are you talking intrusive thoughts from depression/anxiety or psychotic delusions/hallucinations?


If it’s the first, why does it matter that you distinguish?  They’re all coming from you, it’s just that the depressed/anxious ones are like views obscured by dark sunglasses.  It’s good practice and healthy to take a step back and analyze all of your thoughts to make sure they’re in line with your values and that they’re not causing unnecessary difficulty for you.  It may just be a waste of energy to try to spend so much time differentiating."
"I don't really have any advice for you as I'm not familiar with those two meds.  I just want to tell you to hang in there, I've been there and it's a shitty place to be.  Hell, I'm there right now.  I'm disappointed to wake up every morning myself.  Just work closely with the doctor on your medications, maybe try something new.  Six weeks is about the amount of time it takes most antidepressants to work so maybe it's time for a doctor visit?  Sleeping is a coping mechanism, you usually aren't mentally ill in your dreams, you know?  HANG IN THERE.  &lt;3"
"I would say psychological abuse probably involves a lot of fear-mongering. Using fear or unreasonable threats to control your child is psychologically abusive. Screaming at them (beyond what is necessary or reasonable) definitely counts. Mocking your child for things that are beyond their control is abusive. Using your child as a weapon against their other parent is abusive.

In general, any type of unfair treatment of a child qualifies as abusive. It's ok to yell at your kids sometimes, but if you yell at them for wetting the bed, you're being abusive."
"So true! Overall I can hold out okay and brush it off on glum days. But sometimes you just have tougher days where it can be very hard to hide depression. 

Today I even had a customer comment that I looked sad, and asked if I was okay. I said I'd be alright and thanks, but had to then excuse myself to the bathroom to compose myself again as it made me really emotional. (He actually seemed genuinely nice about it, which was cool in itself, but also made me feel exposed heh). Yeah, retail isn't always the best environment for when you're toughing it out."
"Sorry friend, I personally don’t spend time reading aggressive comments. We’re both here because of mental illness, and I’m sorry if you got your feelings hurt. Unfortunately it’s the internet and you’ll have to pick your battles and what triggers you - that’s what I’m doing by “disregarding” what you’ve said. Although it may have been relevant info, it was hidden amongst animosity and I’m choosing to ignore it. Enjoy the group, again, I’m sorry you’re upset so deeply by my inquiry. I hope you’re able to resolve that easily. "
"Thanks. I do lots of research concerning mental health, the brain, the body and how chemicals affect them. I'm a moderate drug user and I'm trying to overcome my weed addiction.

I am also aware that teen's brains, which are still developing, could have a chemical imbalance that may cause a variety of symptoms.

I don't know if I'm seeing any doctor soon but I guess no one but me will be able to help me get through the involuntary sadness I more than often feel.

Thanks again! Your comment made me look at a possibility that I didn't consider until now.
"
"That’s so good to hear!! I’m in the middle of gaining the courage to apply for jobs again. I was in and out of treatment for 2 years and had one job that lasted a month in the middle of everything. I worked with my mom earlier this year to get me going again (I still live at home at 21), but it was only a seasonal position. I’ve been talking to my therapist about getting a job again for months, but it hasn’t gone anywhere because of such bad anxiety.
I’m super glad to hear that it is possible to get back on your feet again after a rough patch."
"Please speak to a health care professional. Do not wait for things to get worse. Im sorry that you feel youre in such a bad place right now. I have been expiriencing a lot of anxiety as of late. That is what led me here. Life is not as long as we would like, but it IS a gift. Every single moment of every single day is something to be grateful for. Your life is worth living. It truly is. You may not think so, but there is no telling how you being here will impact someone else and bring good to this world that we so desperately need.

"What a jerk. I know how you feel though. I have a general rule that I just don't talk about mental health at work. Once a coworker was telling a story where he kept saying that this bipolar guy was crazy and that his reactions were hilarious. He basically implied that people with mental health issues shouldn't be allowed to have jobs almost. I was pretty salty about it because I have bipolar disorder and I also did his job better than him. 

Along that same line of thought, I had a boss once say something about a coworker and I said I thought she was depressed or bipolar and he said that he wishes he would have known because he wouldn't have hired a crazy person. I basically said ""yeah well, you hired me so....."" I told him I have bipolar and he just said that you'd never be able to tell. Like, thanks?

"
"Yeah I deal with that a lot too, I worry everyone is a user and going to suck my well dry, so to speak, or I worry people will get bored of me and abandon me. I also bounce between feeling like I must be super smart and feeling like a total idiot.

I also have weird panic attacks if I'm alone and got used to being around people or talking to someone, it's like I suddenly panic that everyone is gone and never wants to speak to me again. I managed to get them mostly under control but the like, flutter of ""oh fuck panic panic ur alone forever everyone left you"" always comes back.

I also tend to read into stuff that means nothing, and blow up/explode over tiny things because I never have any patience. My emotional regulation is crap but I do manage to take time to myself until I calm down, most of the time."
"^This, so much this. Remember to take thoughts as they come, rather than judging yourself for them. Have you looked up the Unhelpful Thought Patterns guide? Did worlds of good for me. Your responses to your thoughts can blow things up into much bigger concerns when they just started as automatic thoughts on response to some stimulus.

Disclaimer: I have had diagnosed MDD for ten years, have done years of therapy, and am on an antidepressant, but that list/guide helped me a lot to put these thoughts in perspective, because o used to have them a lot and the fact that I was having them freaked me out way more then the thoughts themselves. Not to freak YOU out, but I wanted to show you that all kinds of people can have suicidal ideation and survive - through a variety of techniques, depending on the person. "
"If it makes you feel better, it doesn't really get much easier as you get older. :) By that I mean that I don't see you as a young, dumb kid with a crush that got out of control - even now I find it impossible not to think that someone I'm attracted to is the perfect person for me and being with them is the most important thing in the world.

No matter how many times I go through it, or even how instantly it can collapse on itself and I can get over it like it was nothing, it's still always extremely terrifying. The beginnings of relationships are the worst time for me (the worst time for anything in my life, not just the worst part of a relationship). Once I settle in I'm all good.

Maybe others have different experiences and they find it gets easier, maybe I'll find the same eventually but, so far, at around twice your age and several SOs later, it's still the worst.

The bright side is that it's extra awesome when it finally does work out. Just try to get used to the idea that they only know as much as you tell them, so you're still in control of that."
"I just want to let you know that what you have been through and what you are going through is a chance.

A chance to show your father who you truly are. A successful individual who doesn’t let circumstances or the past determine your future. 

Did you fail and drop out of college because of something he put in your head? No. You WILL finish college and you WILL find a job. You are in control of your life no matter how much you think someone else has control of it. 

It will always be your life. And there will come a day when he isn’t here anymore.. I can tell you right now that your dad is lost. It’s partially his fault and partially the environment he grew around, thought It was “normal” to be mean and strict with his kid and since he never thought to question it and change it then that’s why I say it’s partially his fault... when he’s dead you won’t have a chance to show him what life is really about...


As much as you hate him and for all the things he’s done that you think are unforgivable well the best response to someone who isn’t as fortunate to have a good heart like you is to show them mercy.. show him how he doesn’t affect you or make you mad. Show him that throughout all the shit he’s put you through, YOU are the bigger person who is able to show him love.

By the looks of it this man is far from love. While he’s alive he needs you the most. He’s lost BIGTIME. Just know kids are a blessing and you will be his blessing I know it. I know you won’t let these negative things affect your future. That’s why I say that"
"Psych RN here. This sounds like a classic manic episode, and his symptoms are entirely consistent with bipolar disorder. The grandiosity, hyperactive behavior and increasing paranoia indicate that he’s well into what’s known as a “psychotic break,” meaning he’s losing touch with reality. He is very, very dangerous in this state. He may decide that his closest friends are conspiring against him, trying to murder him, anything. People that only want to help him are likely to be viewed as enemies, and his idea of you and your common friends can change in an instant.

It sounds unlikely that he’ll voluntarily seek immediate, rigorous inpatient psychiatric treatment - which is what he needs, now - so this is where things get tricky. He almost certainly needs to be involuntarily committed, meaning forced to go into a psych hospital. There’s a very clear legal process to do this. I am only familiar with mental health laws in PA (and while I’m familiar with them, I am not an attorney nor any sort of expert) but in general an involuntary commitment can be initiated by a family member, a police officer, or a doctor, but there may be some leeway for a close friend. You should look up a local “psychiatric crisis center” and ask them for guidance. 

If he won’t go to a hospital voluntarily, the police will come collect him. This can, as you no doubt already know, sometimes go very wrong if he decides to resist. A call to your local precinct should give some useful information as far as how to minimize the potential for conflict.

A few things to bear in mind: If you initiate the petition, he will eventually know this; it’s a legal situation, and the person in question thus has a legal right to know who is making these claims, even when it’s in his best interest.

If he owns any guns, the police will either remove them or ensure that they’re secured with a trustworthy family member. He will not be able to legally own a gun for a long time, and the process to reverse this usually means petitioning a court and trying to prove sanity, which isn’t easy.

The hospital will usually keep a person until they’re reasonably stable, but YMMV depending on the quality of the hospital. It’s essential that those close to him make an effort to remain in contact with his assigned social worker/therapist/psychiatrist. He may not consent to allow any of you to communicate with his treatment team. This happens sometimes, and the law is heavily skewed towards maintaining whatever amount of confidentiality that the patient wants. Most of the time the patient will eventually come around and allow contact, once they start to improve. 

However long it takes for him to stabilize, he’ll eventually be released and referred to outpatient services, and it’ll be up to him and his friends and family to ensure that he goes to appointments, takes medication, etc. This is a worry for another day. 

Hang in there. Protect yourself and encourage your friends and family to do the same, DO NOT HESITATE to call the police if you feel unsafe. 


One last thing: I don’t envy you your situation. About 20 years ago one of my closest friends, a kid I grew up next door to had a similar break that culminated in him sitting on his porch in his underwear on a Massachusetts winter night with the barrel of a shotgun in his mouth. A trusted person risked their life and was able to persuade him to go to a hospital. This same kid is now 37, has a great job, great family, and hasn’t ever had to go back into the hospital (though he was in for 2 months that first time.) He still takes a mood stabilizer, sees a psychiatrist monthly, and is otherwise entirely normal. If you met him you’d never suspect a thing.

This is a lousy, dangerous situation that could go a dozen different ways. But there is hope.

Feel free to PM me with any questions. "

"I constantly question my thoughts and emotions. Like, how do i know what is real? How much is me over reacting/being dramatic/ making excuses? That in turn makes it difficult for me to share with others because i think im just being shit.


Does thay kind of relate to what you were trying to get across?"
I have a similar obsession with sleep but mine definitely stems from insomnia. I can’t sleep and definitely get irritated by others sleeping because I am jealous. If he can actually sleep but just doesn’t like it then I am not sure what the problem could be. Maybe it is a phobia or maybe he has OCD.
"I understand &amp; feel everything you said . have you tried the coping skills? try to practice those skills after you open your eyes in the morning , i was breathing slowly through my nose &amp; stretching my muscles after i woke up, It helps sometimes.

"It doesn't necessarily mean you have bpd because fear of abandonment can also just mean you're insecure or it could be a puberty thing, if you're a teen.

"The hardest part is not knowing who he is going to be after his therapy is complete.

He'd be a moron not to come back."
"True! I really felt my shittiest after drinking.

"I feel the same as you and am in a pretty similar circumstance. Personally I had my weed spiked with PCP without my consent 2 years ago and never got over it. It's caused PTSD to the point I won't drink or eat anything that I leave out of my site like in a car while I go into a store without some panic.

Carry yourself with positive body language and take care of your health. Don't put all of your happiness into somebody else's hands. Remember that if you want people to respect you, you have to learn to respect yourself first.

"1 I’ve tried to just feel them and not let it get to me. But it’s been months and I just can’t shake it off and accept them.

2 I haven’t really brought my feelings up because I don’t think they’re justified in any way. She has a right to hang out with her friends if she wants. We already see each other a few times a week. I can’t ask her to only see me. I just don’t see any benefit in bringing it up. There isn’t any viable solution to the fake problem inside my head.

3 I’m just so tired of waiting for me to be okay with these feelings. I haven’t been happy with any of my thoughts in years. I’ve seen a few therapists, taken a few meds, but nothing has worked. It’s so tiring. I can’t get rid of accept my thoughts.

I know you’re right, but I just haven’t been able to do it."
"TBH, missing a single dose here and there shouldn’t be an issue. Shouldn’t. Generally, the lower the dose, the lower the risk of any issue. But, I’m not a doctor, don’t know your history, etc. 

You could also call your doctor’s office and ask them what they want you to do and explain that you don’t want to get a full prescription just to cover three days. Maybe they could move your appointment up by a few days. 

Depending on where you are and whether or not you have insurance, either a full month’s worth or a short supply of a week’s worth or so shouldn’t be very expensive. I think CVS and Walmart tend to have reasonable cash prices for prescriptions like these, if you’re here in the US. I mostly hate Walmart, but what they’ve done with a lot of prescription prices is a good thing."
"&gt;  drinking into a black out or smoking myself into obilvion

Ding ding ding.

Addiction behaviors, AKA not exercising impulse control leads to an underdeveloped control of impulse. You don't have to be born with it to get these symptoms.

&gt; I don't think it can get worse. 

Yes it can. Avoid binging pleasure with drugs/porn/etc.

&gt;  Can this this get better? 

Neuroplasticity. Start removing binges one at a time. Drinking, smoking, masturbating, etc. The longer/harder you indulged in this binges (EG most nights for years), the harder and longer it will take to undo. The shitty part? The more/harder you abused these, the easier it is to relapse into binging behavior. It's not unheard of for people to binge drink for months, then kick the habit and be able to enjoy an odd beer every few days without issues... but someone who binge drank most nights for years may never be able to have a beer again without their impulse control going out the window.

"I'm gonna have to agree with you and say that your ""strange episode"" last December doesn't sound like anxiety, at least anxiety alone.  What I picked up in your previous post, as well as this one, feels like and sounds paranoia.  Do you remember the time of day and about how long the visual hallucinations (shadows in peripheral) lasted?    

Legit delusions are fixed and not open to interpretation.  You wouldn't have the insight to distinguish the truth and reality.  These, your intrusive thoughts, and paranoia, lack of motivation, among potentially other symptoms, should all be discussed with your doctor.  If you can, keep a notebook of your symptoms, like when, what, time, thoughts/feelings, etc.  This is really helpful clinical information for them to have, and for you, so you can monitor progress.

Lastly, even though you said you don't drink or do drugs, now is the time to absolutely avoid them.  If you smoke cigarettes, quit.  Try not to be too hard on yourself, you've got a lot on your plate, so be kind yourself.  

I hope everything goes your way!

"Thanks for typing this out! The key here I think, is people with BPD ""feeling emotions deeply"", which is nothing to be ashamed of. I'm undiagnosed but have suspicions about myself - recently went through a long-term relationship breakup, and if I wasn't BPD before I definitely am now. It was the absolute worst pain in my entire life, hands-down. 

When BPD people feel emotional pain, it causes deep trauma - a sort of mild PTSD I think. Your brain has recorded a series of events that led to deep trauma. Now it tries to constantly recognize patterns in your everyday life that match the memories leading up to the pain. And if it finds even the smallest similarity, it can refresh that pain and trigger defense mechanisms: anxiety, paranoia, fight-or-flight, avoidance or cutting people off completely, defensiveness, etc.. ""the crazies"" basically.

Anytime I feel intense negative emotion I evaluate if the response is appropriate to stimuli. And I also check to see if there is a connection to past trauma. Being rational rather than emotional seems to chill me out."
"You stay up all night on social media, video games, or binge watching tv/movies? 

It's basically depression. I get it too. But the world today makes it so much easier to get sucked into the kind of rut that keeps you doing nothing to get out of it. It's simple to isolate but not feel so bored and lonely that you are forced to go out and do something, because you can waste time online and feel like you're doing something when you're really not doing anything. 

It's hard, but you have to change your environment. Get a job, sign up for classes, find some group to join, or do *something* that requires you to leave the house and be somewhere at specific times. Otherwise you'll just feel trapped in your own boring life and get more depressed. 

Figure out something you want, like having your own apartment or your own car or whatever it is. Let that be the carrot. Make small changes that bring you closer to your goal. Motivation follows action, not vice-versa. So just start with the smallest, easiest thing you can think of and build from there. If you can find a friend to be a passenger on the journey it will be far easier and more fun, but you can do it alone if you have to. Even an internet-only friend can help. There's a thing called ""accountability buddies"" where you just promise to keep one another on target because you have to message the person each day and tell them what you did today to advance towards your goal. 

A therapist can be your guide if you feel you need help or just want someone neutral to talk to about it. Or a life coach if you want to focus more on the positive. 

If you want to change your sleep schedule, it's far easier to stay up an hour or two later each morning until you're going to bed at a normal hour again. Trying to just get up earlier and go to bed earlier is a lot more difficult. It does take a week or two to cycle forward, so you have to plan it out. And after you do it, you've got to stick to that schedule or you'll get right back into it. So no sleeping in on the weekends. Just figure out what time you want to get up and cycle forward until you get there - then get up at that hour every day no matter what. Be kind and make the first hour or so of the morning fun - just read comics and drink coffee or whatever gets you off. It will help you feel like getting out of bed each day. "

Is there a counseling service at your university?
Is there a likelihood you’ll be in danger soon?
It sounds like OCD. That’s probably what it is.
I’m a professional in the field. What are you?
"I’m interested! Bipolar, depression and anxiety"
Look for clinics with sliding scales.. Might help

"I lie a lot.

I manipulate conversations.

I'm in denial.

I often hide how bad I'm doing. Ex: ""I haven't had suicidal thoughts in a year"" when it's been like 2 hours 

I do all of this to protect myself and others from how bad it really is inside. I know it's not healthy but I don't know how else to be."
"I think you did the right thing. He was causing you anxiety and making your life harder. You were a great friend to him, but at the expense of some of your mental health. And right now, he's getting help. I think you should get some help too. Maybe see a therapist (if you aren't already) and talk it out."
"I'm 21 and I feel the same. It's because I just graduated and I have nothing to do. I'm a freelancer so all the work I do is from home desk. I don't meet people, I don't talk and I really feel lonely. But I think you are experiencing something different. Would love to talk. I'm a Psychology graduate too."
"I'm not currently going through benzo withdrawal, but I'm planning to withdraw. I just can't withdraw yet because my sleep is disturbed like this.

Exactly as prescribed would be to not take it at all, because the current psychiatrist didn't prescribe it to me, and as I said, had a limited opinion on it."
I'm sorry that you're going through this. My mom has issues similar to your mom and I went through similar issues when I was your age. I'd advise seeking help. At your age it should be offered as confidential (as in your parents won't know). The important thing for you now is to sort this out. Good luck.
It's not like I have money to give anyway. I have no job and live with my mom. The men I meet will give me drugs from time to time. I tried getting a job but I feel just as depressed there and all I can think about is getting high or sex. I pushed myself into a corner that I don't know how to get out of.
"Oh, umm... It isn't really a specific thing. Just an overwhelming anxious feeling. My partner isn't home and that's always hard. I'm fairly certain it has partly to do with that. Also the likely hood of something happening is slim. I know all of this logically, but when I'm stuck in the moment I forget. "
"See a doctor, don’t just come off them on your own. The reason you feel better could be because of the medication. A lot of us fall into the trap of feeling better, only to stop taking the medication and have the symptoms return ten times worse. 
Either way, you will need to see a doctor to taper off. "
"They only have the one receptionist who books all of the appointments . I would complain but I bout it would do any good. This is the only mental health clinic that my insurance covers and it’s not that great. 

I’m getting new insurance within the next couple of months and will find someone better. "
"What do you think people will think of you if you tell them youre depressed all the time, they will see you as a person with low self esteem and therefore look down at you. This is something you do not want and that is why you aren't saying it. It's actually healthy and the wise choice to not say it. Duh"
"Do you “feel” emotions? I always thought apathy was just not feeling anything, whether it be happiness or sadness. And also just not caring about other people’s emotions as well. 
I was on seroquel and now on lithium and I feel like lithium leaves more room for emotions if that makes sense. Lithium works better for me and doesn’t make me feel as much as seroquel, although seroquel was better for me than most antidepressants... those REALLY made me feel like a zombie. But maybe trying to change your meds can help you can always try it out and see. "
"I'm not a medical professional and no one can diagnose you here. Disclaimer. 

&amp;#x200B;

However from my personal experience this doesn't sound like depression, this sounds pretty typical for a lot of college students. If you start to get your sleep schedule back on track  I think a lot of your other problems will resolve themselves (like the skipping meals for more sleep). 

&amp;#x200B;

None of this strikes me as depression, especially if you're not sad or have other persistently negative feelings. But maybe someone else has a different experience."
"OK calm down. My mind does this too. When someone says ""can we talk?"", it jumps IMMEDIATELY to ""Oh, no. What have I done wrong? What's going to happen? This can't be good...""   


Most of these times, it was just an innocuous chat. The person wanted to ask me something, or clarify something, and sometimes it WAS a more serious talk that usually had me in tears or upset. Try not to overthink it (I KNOW it is hard!) and do some deep breathing if that helps calm you down.  


You can message me right before or after he talks to you if you need to chat. &lt;3"
"Oh boy. You and I need to talk. I recently quit a job for a new one because my boss, who is apparently a diversity and inclusion council member, ran me out if my job after I told her I had OCD and panic. 

Your boss sounds like my dad. He says the same shit. 

The job market is hot right now. Use it to your advantage before the next ""correction"" in the market happens. Find a boss that understands.

Please feel free to message. I'm a married 32f and I fight daily with my illness and the people who lack understanding, and it is tough as shit.

Stay strong. "
"Thanks for your input :)
Yeah this is something that my girlfriend and have been talking about and acknowleding it and how it is obviously a path we really want to avoid. And we're working on it as a team so it doesn't escalate into anything ugly.

Yeah the agrophobia thing we're going to try and tackle when I move up by getting me out more in small manageable bits

The guilt thing is obviously a big factor and obviously something I never want to happen and something I can address with my doctor and ask to be referred for therapy to help with these issues"
"&gt;SSRI’s would be taking away the suicidal thoughts if it was depression.

Since we're on the topic of SSRIs and antidepressants, I'll mention that they do have a [black box warning for increased suicide risk in patients of certain ages](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/antidepressant-medications-for-children-and-adolescents-information-for-parents-and-caregivers.shtml).

This is mostly due to how the medication works (e.g. increased energy before the improved mood). From now on, do be sure to monitor for further signs of suicidal tendencies.

The psychiatrist can assess if he may be a candidate for other medications indicated for treatment-resistant depression later on. If we do end up discontinuing the SSRI, do be sure it is properly tapered by the prescriber."
"I am so sorry this is going on. It must be so hard. We are technically working poor and my husband just lost his job recently so now we don't have that income to bolster my Disability and the SSI we get for our disabled boys. I know how you feel. Our eldest daughter came out as a lesbian (and has a long-time girlfriend of 2 years now) a few years ago, and at first it was hard for her dad to accept, but now we are both fine with it. Even hubby has accepted it. I wish that could be the case for you. NOBODY should be made to feel bad about their sexual orientation! My other friend is transitioning from female to male, and I don't think anything less of him. I wish people would just get into this century sometimes and realize that people are who they are and not what society WANTS them to be. Good luck to you!"
"Two main things that worked for me (and still works sometimes) that might help if you want to do the things you want to do, but are still ""stuck"":
1. Friends/ support/ buddy system! These are the people who do the same things you want to do. Doing stuff with them makes it feel like you're there for the sake of them, and not just being there selfishly or by yourself... which moves the focus on why you want to do the things outward (because that ""stuck"" feeling is mostly an inward ""solo"" focused feeling I think). Another way to draw your attention outward so your ambition can do it's thing:
2. Reward system! It's basically the reason you go to work in the first place... just find a way to ""if I do this, then I'll reward myself with ________ (i.e. ice cream, a gadget, or simply a shower or a nap afterwards)""."
"Was just thinking about this an hour or so ago. 

Hiking with friends, having many good experiences today. 

Also thinking about killing my self for almost the entire day. 
The usual high speed merry-go round in my head of of things I hate about my self, things I hate about other people, things I can’t explain, all torturing me virtually nonstop as it’s always been, thinking about how tired beyond tired beyond tired I am of this hellish existence but I’m high functioning enough that people are still comfortable taking pot shots at me, bullying me at work, mocking my weirdness, manipulating me, building their ego up at my expense.

But if I go through with it and kill myself then they will get to have their dramatic moment and say “OHHHH what a waste, he was such a good guy, we miss him so much”.

"nooooo, nonononono, buddy, my mom has all the legal power in the world over me and she is 100% convinced that im making everything up,, i tried to get through to her, i tried calmly explaining how i feel, i tried having a mental fucking breakdown and crying and screaming because of how i feel, but both times, all she did was threaten to send me to a psych ward again, or better yet, just sorta give me up for adoption,, even tried family therapy and when they told her she should try to listen more, she blamed it on me, saying i dont tell her anything and she quit family therapy,,

her solution to these things is to hold a giant threat of losing the few things that make me feel better over my head, i cant let her know just how fucking shit i feel, because then shes gonna take away the last few things i love,,"
"It's great to hear that you want to seek help. Be proud of yourself! Regarding free/cheap mental health services in America, I recommend taking a look at r/anxiety's wiki page on how to find a therapist regardless of your insurance/financial situation. To summarize it, you can ask therapists if they can charge on a sliding scale, which just means they take your income and insurance into account and reduce the cost. Many therapists and even doctors often reduce prices for patients. Here's the link to the wiki page: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/gettinghelp#wiki_how_to_find_a_good_therapist_and.2For_psychiatrist

To get the most out of your time and money, I recommend asking the therapist(s) you reach out to if they offer free consultations over the phone. That way you can speak to the therapist for ten to fifteen minutes just to see if you would click with them. You can get some sense of how the therapist's approach would fit during this consultation. The cool thing is that many therapists offer this option. 

Let me know if you have any questions!

"&gt;Edit: Why is no one responding? PLEASE HELP ;-;

2 hours. Fucking patience.

The few people I knew who specifically complained about this had an ADHD diagnosis but refused to be medicated for it. ADHD itself overlaps with half a dozen other issues with nearly identical symptoms. The worst individual for this would, for example, talk about how he was going to move his couch for three or four fucking days before actually just fucking doing the five minute task. Research tools and strategies for managing ADHD, and apply them to your life even if you don't have an ADHD diagnosis. They're useful for most people.

So, it could be a mild cognitive impairment or learning disorder or something along those lines. You might try getting some 7 mg nicotine patches, cut them in half, tape the cut edge sealed (it will leak if cut), to make roughly 3.5 mg patches. Low dosage around this amount, with nicotine by itself not taking anything else, has been documented to be fairly effective across a board number of cognitive impairments over a year or more without significant risk of addiction (tobacco contains other chemicals which make it more addictive).

&gt; I'm on the verge of going crazy trying to figure out how, just the insane thought process of these people. 

For starters, they don't do this. Panic, flail, and think about thinking about how they're going to think for hours. Said individuals I knew with ADHD complained the medication made them too ""robotic"". That's what you need to be doing. You'll find the management strategies involve chunking tasks.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Thank you. I've kinda given up on therapy after 20 ish counsellors, psychs, therapists/practitioners, coaches, etc.

So lost. Too many heavy things in my head 24/7 to cope with, but I'm too afraid to kill myself, and much of the time realize how much I don't want to do so.

Thanks for your response.

I get the thing about the amount of friends that actually care about you. It's crazy to see how fake most relationships are, even ""close"" ones. Not that people are ""bad"", but mostly so self involved that there isn't really much room for real concern for others beyond what investment of ""concern"" they think will benefit them in some way, whether consciously or not.

Also the non-existent relationship status being an issue. I've been single for 7 years and every relationship before that was a mess. Lot's of people think I'm gay, not that that should matter, but it does when they treat you like crap or are condescending as a result (TONS of social exclusion and outright mocking from bigots, and condescending attacks from people who think they're not bigots but like to poke fun at me because ""they know something I don't know"" about me, even though they're full of shit and don't know what I've considered or entertained and what i know to be true about myself). Venting, lots there obviously haha...
Where was I...oh yeah...the non-existent relationship jabs.

I worry that my whole pattern of relationships says something is seriously wrong with me, where as when I was younger I could still hope that ""things would change""....at my age it means I'm damaged or something. 

"
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading your story. It was very thorough and well put together. My initial thoughts are similar to what you mentioned... having overwhelmed your brain earlier in your intense studies. Studying and education are great things, but it sounds like you may have (subconsciously) put too much pressure on yourself to succeed and pushed yourself past the limits? I also feel like many people go through phases like this, where they become dysfunctional and unproductive, and everything seems too much to handle. I had my break down in my last year of university, I think it was the stress of preparing and transitioning into ""adult hood"" and trying to be responsible and ""get it all together"".  That also sounds like you too, like you mentioned  wanting success, social skills, becoming a functioning adult, which are all healthy goals but perhaps the pressure of attaining so many things has overwhelmed your brain. When i had major anxiety during my last year of university, everything became SO difficult. Even doing a load of laundry seemed like the utmost impossible draining task ever. It really upset me that I wasn't able to do such simple things without feeling like it was this huge task.   


Regarding advice... I think its important you take that pressure off yourself, let go of the ASAP mentality, give yourself space and permission to rest, to do nothing, to be silly, to watch funny things, to go for nice nature walks, to do anything but focus on ""how to succeed as an adult"" You will probably feel quite anxious and unproductive, as I did too, but slowly you may get back in touch with yourself and realize that succeeding isn't the most important thing in the world. Your well being and health is ! If you can afford to, see a cousellor or therapist, with the intention of understanding yourself more, what has triggered this anxiety and unproductivity, NOT with the intention of ""how to make my brain work so i can get back into studying"". Also, its important to give yourself compassion and kindness, stop comparing with what you ""used to"" be capable of, understand that something has happened in your life to cause this issue, and your body/mind may be trying to signal that you may need to slow down. To the best of your ability, try to maintain healthy habits, light exercise, eating healthy foods, etc, it will be hard and you won't feel like it, but it will contribute to your overall health in the long run so try to force yourself if you can. Lastly, i think its still important to speak to a health professional about this, it does sound a bit extreme, and terrifying, like youre losing control of yourself. Posting here is a good outlet, and has helped you articulate your experiences (which I'd say was done quite well even though you mentioned how much of a struggle it was to write this), keep researching and trying to find other's who experience similar things, go to the library take out some books relating to anxiety/mental health. Talk about it as much as you can with anyone you feel will be able to relate or provide any insights. Keep in mind there may be no quick fix, this may linger for awhile, so you need to mentally prepare that you will not able to reach all your upcoming goals (it's unfortunate but there is not much choice until you feel more functional).  Seriously, i think many many people experience some sort of breakdown and crisis, don't be so hard on yourself, don't compare with others who are able to perform basic tasks with ease whom seem to have a functioning brain- you don't know in what areas they may struggle in differently from you.  Meditation is always recommended, to help ground yourself and reconnect your body and mind, and to learn to sit with uncomfortable feelings and thoughts. It's really hard and sometimes quite boring, but overall it has great benefits if you are able to practice even just a little bit whenever you can. There are guided meditations that take you away (like you imagine you are somewhere else- a beach, an island, etc). It also helps strength brain power/concentration because you do need to keep refocusing. I wish you well ! "
A lot of people at r/CPTSD would relate to this.
"Agreed!!! 

Thank you SO much!!!!! Same to you!!! "
"Alters can go dormant, but they can't be ""killed""."
Are you diagnosed with any psych disorders/issues?
Are you seeing a therapist? Maybe you're bipolar.
Bcs u eat-smoke-masturbate for escaping a anxiety
Can I ask what this is for? It sounds interesting.
Congratulations! Good sleep is so hard to come by.
How did you get through it? Asking for a spouse...
How long did your follow up intakes normally take?
I am a firestarter...a firebug...obsessed with it.
I enjoy listening to soothing music to help relax.
I feel this the same way but unsure why too ��
"I tried contacting them, I was completely ignored."
Many psychologists will work on a sliding scale.
Maybe check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube?
Psychs can help. I recommend seeing one of those.
"Situational depression is absolutely a thing, yes."
"Thank you! I'm just the wire, you the message. ;)
"
"Thank you, I hope you keep finding peace yourself."
Thank you. I hope you never feel like that again.
That is absolutely terrifying. Please see a doctor
That's not a bad idea thank you for the suggestion
Ugh my head is such a bad place to be right now...
YAY! I love that little guy. :) You made me smile.
You are incredibly strong and brave! ����
have you ever considered maladaptive day dreaming?
i feel like that all the time and it terrifies me.
"Definitely! I probably need to read some more philosophy and figure out how they deal with all this stuff. I have to go now (it's getting late here and I got an early start tomorrow) but hope catch you again sometime either here or if there's an r/philosophy!

Or pm me if you've got an existential crisis!"
"Eh... it is never too late! :-)  
The first time i spoke to someone and got help i already was 36 years old and i am doing a little bit better each week since i started.  

For a long time i was stuck in the past, thinking about it for way too much each day.  
But over time that gets better, bit by bit!

"
"Email her a thank you, but financially or whatever have changed and unfortunately you will have to discontinue blah blah...pay an outstanding balance and wish her well. That's it. You dont owe your therapist any more than that 

Edir: you could do it in person but then you'll have to pay for the session. "
"For sure.  Like I said, I am very active, so I exercise regularly.  I have a talk therapist that I use when something specific is bothering me.  I eat pretty clean.  This is just something I've dealt with for as long as I can remember, and medication has made the biggest difference in my quality of life. "
"Have you tried hypnosis? I've always been interested in trying it but, not sure if it really works. Maybe doesnt work for some people...?

I have OCD, so I remember a lot of my trauma, but I think there may be more things I've buried in my psyche because they occurred when I was too little to understand. "
"Hmm, interesting. Yea, its pretty wack how the insurance system causes things like this (the whole *doctors generally wont do more than a 15 minute consultation). 


I guess what would satisfy me the most would be seeing a therapist weekly, and the doc taking recommendations from them into consideration. "
"I feel u. TBH don't do anything act as ur self. I know it's strange but do as if no one watch u. They may laugh at u, either way you don't overlook on ur behavior. And that's also easy to anyone who want to be friend with u to see who u actually are. Believe me ur beautiful but maybe u don't notice yet.  "
"I just wish I could find a psychiatrist/therapist who doesn't baby me. I just want to know what's wrong, what the mental illness might make me feel, how I can work around it. Feels like if I even mention BPD or something all my other problems get thrown out the window and they blame everything on the bpd."
"I'm delighted to see that you've made it that far, I mean, I'm 16 at the moment. I don't see myself living past 25, perhaps I just can't imagine beyond that point but, if you've made it that far perhaps there's some hope for myself. Maybe I should stop being so cynical about the world, what would you say?"
Its the worst thing you can expect from someone whom you trusted enough to open up . But sadly you can't change people . Just you will be more carefull next time before sharing . And there's nothing to be embarrassed about your issues . Rather you should be proud of that you are trying to get over those .
"It’s probably that you live together and spend a lot of time in the same house. It’s ok to find your parents annoying. They are just people. Try your best to acknowledge how you are feeling, and then try to move forward with your thoughts. Once you move out you will probably find her less irritating. "
"Shower every day, then i share some time with my family to not being alone in my room. 
Meet new people in free classes of everything; drawing for example at the young place for people of my age in the city... its hard to go if you feel bad i was so sad today and now i have new friends! Just stay strong!."
"That is wonderful news. Not an easy thing to do (it has been a month and a half for me). I am happy to hear that you have prevailed and are still with us. It's definitely worth celebrating! And it's a motivation to us that haven't made it that long, you are showing us that it's possible to overcome this. "
"This may not be the case for everyone but something that helps me with my anxiety is that whenever I start to feel a panic attack coming on, I repeat to myself “this is just an exaggerated response to a non-life threatening situation”. Doesn’t always work but can help kick the negative thought loop "
"I was absolutely convinced I had bipolar: turns out, it's my alters! They all have such different ways to behave that it looked a lot like manic states when some of them were out. 

I am so, so sorry your ex wife did that to you. My ex boyfriend I was with for nearly six years had a counsellor for a mother, and she happily ""counselled"" me when I was very depressed. Ofc she made a lot of stuff worse, as I'm sure your ex wife did. It's such a betrayal of trust and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 

Best wishes to you and for your continuing recovery!"
"I'm diagnosed with bipolar, and my experience is episodes that last months. I don't get ""mixed"" episodes, I'm either OK, severely depressed or manic. There are different types of bipolar though, and different treatments that can vary in effectiveness from person to person. I've found for myself that Lamictal (an antiseizure drug used as a mood stabilizer) keeps me pretty level. The biggest thing though is routine. I try to go to sleep at the same time every day including weekends, and wake up at the same time, eat dinner at the same time every day... Etc. "
"My skincare routine (it's not super elaborate but has a few more steps than cleanse and moisturize... not in a compulsive way, it would be minimal if I lived in South Korea). The days when I do it (and makeup, even if I'm not going out) I notice a big improvement for both my functioning (in AM) and ability to wind down for bed (PM).

I haven't had great luck with meditation because my thoughts will race and I can't clear my head. If I have some simple repetitive tasks (especially those that are self-care related) it blanks my mind out and is very soothing."
"Ouh your panic flight story. I used to do that a lot. Then I’d flee and be able to calm myself. Now I’m able to calm myself before fleeing. Took lots of effort lots of therapy (both self directed and professional therapy). But if you set your mind to it you can get through it I swear. 

You’re right about being aware of people feelings etc but it’s all directed to the present. Being aware of things in the present. Cause when we’re panicking/depressed it’s usually about perceived mistakes in the past or things that could go wrong in the future. "
"I've got this advice a lot. Unfortunately I am really bad at coding. I tried to take the first-year CS course and I failed. I have non-verbal learning disability so I am bad at math. I mean, I am better than the average liberal arts student (I did pass linear algebra somehow), but compared to people who are good at math (CS students) I am terrible.

What language do you suggest? Everyone says Python, but I don't actually know what it is used for. I don't actually know what people do with coding because I've never had an issue where I've needed to code something to fix it. 

I went to university that was big on computer science and people have trouble finding co-op jobs. The prospects seem pretty dim for untalented amateur.

I've thought about learning something about *nix administration, but I don't know.

"
"This is good advice. In terms of your job OP, if you’re about to be fired you could throw a Hail Mary and be honest with your boss. Approach them before they approach you and tell them that you have been struggling to fulfill your job duties and are taking measures (if you plan to, and as soon as possible) to address the problem. Ask for a performance review and if they can structure something to help you get back on track. Don’t make excuses or try to gain sympathy. If they are willing to work with you just do your very best to improve. 


Not every boss has the capability or even the money to be sympathetic under these circumstances. As a business owner I would appreciate the honesty and try to work with an employee if they approached me in this manner, as long as they were performing well previously."
"Valid question. Not I couldnt say that there isn't *any* risks with long-term treatment using any drug - but the studies on antipsychotics have been inconclusive, and definitely nothing that warrants a change in practice or a review of national prescribing guidelines in the UK. There are some studies on brain volumes, but its complicated by the fact that there are changes in brain volumes in psychosis, and there usually associated lifestyle factors compounding the results. Its also overridden by the significant benefits of the drug in those appropriately prescribed it - reducing symptoms and distress and improving overall levels of functioning.

Im lucky not to have suffered a major enduring mental disorder - but id happily take risperidone for 20 years. Much safer than alcohol anyway, and I consume that..."
"I don't think it would be a bad idea to see a therapist about this; they help with this sort of thing, as well. But, if you're just looking for casual advice, I would suggest experimenting with different hobbies, types of music and activities. Find out your likes, dislikes and passions. Keep a journal. See it as an opportunity to ""make yourself."" Often when people don't know who they are and what they like, it stems from an upbringing where a child was expected to live up to expectations and be someone they were not for the benefit of the parents. They've just never had the chance to grow and explore the way they should have during childhood and adolescence.

Many people with this issue also have difficulties with boundaries and can get easily enmeshed with others. If you find yourself needing to emulate the people around you and it causes you anxiety to refrain from doing this, it may be time to ask for some help from a therapist. It's sometimes hard to navigate boundaries by yourself and there's no shame in having someone point you in the right direction. "
"I have been in The View several times in my past for a litany of issues. Smyrna is better than any other acute facility in Georgia. Not saying it’s good, nor extremely helpful, but it’s the only somewhat decent candidate in the state. Monroe may be new but it sure as hell ain’t clean. If you’re a professional, the original Ridgeview Institute might be your only option...for most of the programs there are more developed and effective than elsewhere. If you go, keep your important physical valuables in your sight 24/7- applies to everyone. Some might be locked up and kept with security though. Staff can be assholes no matter who you are, most are chill. Administration is a huge pain in the arse though. Well, unless you come in on a 1013 (escorted by police/medical transportation and required by law to be inpatient for a minimum of 72 hours) then you have fun staring at an orange wall then a grey wall- all in the same room!! Just speaking from my personal experience and trying to answer to the best of my ability. I hope I helped out with your question. "
"You guys need to sit down and figure out a long term plan. If you don't have insurance for a doctor's visit, then you need to find ways to stay productive. And that doesn't include video games (no offense). Get out of the house. Go to the park. Go to the library. Go to the gym. You need to change your mindset about life. Once you do that then maybe things will start looking up for you two.

But nothing will change until you put your entire effort into ""fixing"" the problems in your life. You need to put every ounce of your energy into finding a job. And you need to put every ounce of your energy into not blowing money on video games. Go to the department of human resources or whatever it's called where you live. They should be able to help you apply for jobs.

And last but not least, the only way you'll ever overcome anxiety problems (if it's social anxiety) is by forcing yourself to be around other people. You have to face it head on or nothing will ever change. It's possible to overcome this but you have to apply yourself to the best of your ability first.

"There isn't really anything the psychiatrists haven't heard or seen that will make them jump up so to say. If you don't actually want to harm your spouse or anyone else these might be thoughts of an intrusive nature possibly not psychopathic at all even though they sound disturbing. That you don't want to act on them or at least have a strong enough will and discipline to keep these thoughts at bay and seek out help as to why they might be happening is a good indicator that they won't flag you or ""put you away"".  They will offer you counseling. They might offer you meds if it's something of a compulsive thought problem, that could help. How do you phrase it. Just be honest. You're saying here that you don't have those intentions that they're just thoughts so you can tell the doctor that you don't want or like these thoughts and that that's why you're there. 

You ought to go for it, it might seem really awkward or difficult to speak about at first but these are things you've got to address and the sooner you start the process the better your chances of fixing them will be. If you want you can tell him/her (doctor) that you have several issues to discuss, do bring up everything you've said here but to break the ice you can start with the body dysmorphia which is in itself a serious issue. The anxiety, the depression, none of these things are small issues. But bring everything up. Ask to see them again, it takes months of seeing them and doing work to get to the bottom of it. But even here with what you've said is a start, making the appointment is a good idea. "
Are you sure you're not just depressed in general?
Did you try to talk about it with a professionist?

"I ABSOLUTELY HAVE THIS PROBLEM

I can have my stories that are not my daydreams, and then when trying to write my daydreams they are just not easy to have in words.

my day dreams i can spend hours on what a bolt in a chair can look/feel like but when trying to adapt that to my writing it feels impossible."
"I had to tell my therapist recently that things are almost always much worse than I make them out to be, largely because I am so used to being depressed that what seems normal to me is very depressed to others. It’s easy to forget sometimes, when you are depressed, that it’s not happening to everyone. "
"I know of places that will tattoo over self harm scars. The only one I'm familiar with is in Ireland but I'm sure there are more. The one I know about will not tattoo over scars unless you have stopped self harm for over a year.

"I try to keep my room as clean as possible, so when I come home I can change to comfy clothes and always make sure there is something to eat so that I can watch netflix and eat. Sometimes buy something good to make it even better.

"I'm dealing with this now, and I told my best friend and she closed up and ran away from me, told me she can't deal with my emotions, and it killed me.

"I'm probably of little help but I thought I'd give it a shot:

What do you think of a career that involves helping others directly? Nursing for example. Sure it will require you to gain qualifications first...remember that human beings derive happiness from knowing that their jobs contribute to society. 

"
"I'm sorry you feel that way. It can be difficult when you have a judgemental family but hopefully they could see that you are unwell and need to get help, just like if you had broken your leg. Try to look at it that way, and consider helping your family to see it that way. Hope you're feeling better today."
"Not necessarily, it just depends on each individual.  Just because I can feel something doesn't necessarily mean everyone elese will.  Everyone's experience is different, it may just be someone is too consumed by their depression at that time to concentrate on any other feeling but the love is still there."
"Okay, yes some people are clever. Though what worked for me was attention instead of thinking. Action instead of planning. No priority list or anything. Once you actually get things done, soon there is always only 1 or 2 things on that list anyway. Thinking itself is the hindering thing, was for me anyway "
"Okay. Well I've dealt with ""lack of motivation"" before quite a bit in my lifetime. Whether that's been school, work, home life, etc. I also struggle with depression and other issues too. Just be sure that you're honest with your doctor and therapist. That way they can help you to the best of their ability."

"Is always good to have a life plan, but sometimes you need to let life take you where you need to go. I know that seems stupid. Believe me, i do. But it works.

"It makes sense. You are totally right.   
A man who doesn't feel anything is considered golden in this society, or so I feel. He might have emotions, but he is squezing it in a positive way, like you said. If managed well. 

I don't have zero feelings, but I do like to think that I have. But you are right, It won't make life any more fuller. I guess what I'm trying to say is; I wish I could manage my emotions. 

I also can safely assume that my emotions are much harder to control then most other people, they are so much stronger, and they kick in too soon. "
"Step one - stop overestimating others. 

Step two - stop over-valuing the opinions of others. People just project their ideal self image and compliment it - or they project their least desired attributes onto others and then criticize them. And judgments sent your way are a direct result of the insecurity or inner conflict within the deliverer. 

Step three - stop using social media. 

Lastly - I recommend a book called ""A new earth"" by Eckhart Tolle. It can be hard to take seriously because it has some pseudo-spiritual undertones but it is very impactful. "
"You have to search for that person, I don't know if you prefer a man or a woman or what personality you resonate with the most, it all starts with that getting along with the counsellor. 

Do you have a trust issue? You may need to work on that if you do, speaking to your dog or a stranger on the internet, ""Hi"", or a parent/friend. Maybe it would be easier to speak with a therapist who's out of town, a new environment, somewhere you haven't been before but you still know and not far from home.

We're all on this planet to help eachother, you're never alone."
"Are you me? I’m a dietitian and feel very similar to this in my current job. I assure you, everything is going to be ok, one way or another. Whether things work out the way you plan, or life takes a different direction for you, you are capable of so much more than you can imagine. 

Sounds like your exam is different from mine. Were you able to get any feedback on the first one? So that you know where you need to brush up? The schooling you’ve already finished is no joke, you got this. Pull out some notes and just have them nearby if you’re feeling unmotivated. It makes it much easier to study if everything is easy to access. And it can be easier to study if you’re not actually pressuring yourself too much (I find anyways). 

If you haven’t already, you can pop over to r/dietetics for more info :) "
"How old are you? What small things make you happy? When I was a lot younger I developed an out of nowhere severe depression and felt extremely similar to what you’re experiencing. Eventually I found someone to love, and they also loved me. I still feel the same depression every so often, but having someone to help you through it and support you, helps sooo much. Whether it’s from a significant other, a best friend, spiritual outlets, or whatever, love truly does heal. That of course with personalized therapy and patience will lead to feeling “normal” one day. I wish the best for you. 

And also to add on: it sucks when close ones, parents for example, don’t even sympathize or understand. There are ways to get them to understand the severity of your well being, but it’s definitely not suicide! :( "
"My psychotic symptoms started in 2014. From PTSD. Which I don't want to get into right now. The PTSD has crippled me for the past few years and it's pushed me to suicide almost a couple times.

I don't go places because I'm afraid that people will hurt me. I can't handle everyday human noises such as coughing, sneezing, sniffing, and clearing throats. They drive me crazy. So I wear noise cancellation headphones or listen to music when I leave my room. I'm 26 right now btw.

I workout which helps me but that's basically all I do besides housework or yardwork. I've basically just been laying in bed and staring at the wall for the past couple years. Once again because of the PTSD.

I'm suffering from depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc also. So combine all those together and it's a pretty miserable life.

"Psychological abuse is often handed down from generation to generation. A parent experiences it as a child and has no idea what it was. That person is damaged but denies it because well, denial is a thing, and because especially in years past mental health was a taboo subject. They pass it on to their kids having no idea what they are doing, or knowing but being unable or afraid to get help.

In groups, the same thing can happen, exacerbated by unhealthy shepherd/flock dynamics and trust that is granted when it isn't earned.

I'm not a psychiatrist so I can't diagnose anything. But if you feel traumatized, you are, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. 

Whether abuse is unintentional or not doesn't matter. Neither does what anyone else things. If you feel abused, get out of the situation and seek help."
"Hello, thanks for your courage in sharing. Questions:

1. Do you have siblings whom you played with growing up and did you ever have such feelings you're concerned about?
2. Have you ever had such feelings with other kids when you were in school or anyone ever younger than you?
3. If your answer to the above two questions is no then I think you are unnecessarily concerned and I'm not sure where that irrational fear would come from. In that case you likely have more self discipline than you may give yourself credit for, because you likely don't have those same feelings with your parents or acquaintances or friends, or people of authority, or family members. Fear is reduced with experience that confronts and challenges the false belief. So, I would confront that before getting married and having kids, by volunteering or doing activities with a mix of ages in a supervised environment with other adult supervisors, maybe sports, teaching, etc. Be aware of your feelings, but also genuinely volunteer to help others for the right reasons and not thinking of yourself."
"I've got a bunch of stories but recently I had pain in one of my testicles so I went to the walk in clinic. They send me to the emergency room and I was sure it was because I had cancer, not only that but that it had spread to my lungs. Turns out I just had an infection.

  


Most recently I was sure and am still unsure but my doctor recommended I try an anti psychotic med for my anxiety and I thought she was implying I have schizophrenia so I spent a few weeks googling and worrying and I even saw a psychologist about it who said he didn't think I had it. I didn't belive him though. So now I've disabled my internet browsers..

  


Thought I had ebola when I was 5 and occasionally worry I have aids, herpes, cancers of many kinds including breast, skin, lymph and testicular.

  


I went to the er before because my pee makes bubbles when I stand up and pee into the toilet. I also thought I had ketoacidosis because I saw a commercial about it being a side effect of some med I've never taken.

  


I got ocd too so Idk which is doing this but it's pretty rough."
"Hi, I can tell you you are rightfully worried. From what you said, he does have Delusions of Grandeur and quite possibly a lot more. Narcissist maybe? Always comparing your lives and I'm assuming always insinuates his life could have been better IF....? When you combine Delusions of Grandeur with a Narcissistic personality it can certainly be disastrous. I would know because I too have them both. However, I'm not stupid. I can step back and take a look at myself and realize it and check it before it causes harm to myself or others. The fact that he went behind your back and intruded on your mom without permission, and with your answer already being no, shows me he has lost it. You are no longer a friend to him....You and your family are just pawns in his game to use at his disposal. He will continue to use you and disturb your life until this gets worse....Either he hurts himself, someone else, or goes to jail for something. Lose this guy as a friend immediately....This coming from a Narcissist, I know all the signs and I know the game...Get a restraining order on him if you need to...NOT JOKING....After that uninvited mom move... it is that serious....hope this helps.

"Hey, So I have a *LOT* and I mean a *LOT* of friends who have bipolar disorder and I'm sorry to say it sounds to me as though you must have it too. The bad news is it actually incurable and will remain with you the rest of your life. However, the good news is you can get therapy to help deal with your episodes and keep track of when you're feeling high and low - almost like your menstrual cycle (which can actually effect it as well); and go onto medication to keep you stable, or at least more stable than you are now.

&amp;#x200B;

Your best bet is to visit your Doctor as soon as possible to get diagnosed and then they can help you with medication and therapy options best suited to you and your schedule. I would also say it is worth telling your fiancé about all this (maybe not the things you've mentioned that might hurt their feelings like ""wanting to sleep with every man"" - even though that is entirely natural during manic episodes) as communication is important and they should always be up-to-date on how you're thinking and feeling. If you can both sit down together and read into the disorder (or maybe wait till you've seen a doctor and gotten diagnosed and/or probably leaflets about the subject) then that way they can help to keep an eye on you for signs you may be acting irrationally or impulsively - as well as this, they might actually be able to point out ways in which you already tend to be bipolar which can be really helpful to acceptance and recovery!

&amp;#x200B;

The key to this disorder isn't attempting to overcome or ignore it, it's learning, accepting and understanding it. It's all about knowing which days are your good days, which are your bad and doing the things you can to make those days easier for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this has been some help - and hope everything goes well for you."

The first two times I was hospitalized I didn't do any follow-up therapy or take my meds. Which eventually led to my 3 visit. That's when I took the hint and have been on meds for over a year.

"Yup! This is how it was for me in the beginning, too.

In the UK it's Samaritans 116 123. Failing that call an ambulance.

"Happens to me a couple times each day. I say some pretty random things outloud. Always the same words or sounds.  These include :  Hookers, what if I just killed myself, eh eh eh eh, why, what if I shot the sheriff. And a few others. 

I'm diagnosed bipolar so i suffer from racing thoughts.  Whenever a particularly embarrassing memory reappears I unconsciously blurt it out. Then I have to explain why I blurted out  HOOKERS! 

I saw a similar post about this ""condition"" today. Which means I'm not the only one that does it. I wonder if there is a name for it. "
"Holy shit that was an intense little read. I was so happy that end sentence was there as I was about to suggest he exact same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing you can do now to help this situation is vow to never take him back - because he WILL come crawling back. And when he begs for you back, remember this time and all the other times, remember how many times he left you practically for dead and wasn't there for you when you needed him most. And just say no. Because you deserve so so so much better than him and you should never waste even a second more of your time on someone who doesn't treat you right."
"I’m currently dating someone who has an avoidant attachment style and a high conflict personality (my guess is that my SO might have borderline personality disorder but I don’t think it’s that severe at all). 

I’ve always been a fan of psychology and I’ve done a lot of personal research over the years. I’ve read a lot of literature about dealing with them and identifying their behaviors. I would recommend searching literature from high conflict institute. 

I think Cognitive Behavioral therapy could have some success. Working on choosing your thoughts&gt;feelings&gt;actions. But a therapist would obviously be of more use. 

I think it would be a major plus if you spoke frankly with your loved ones about your issues so they can understand and learn how to communicate with you. 

If you genuinely want to change then this is awesome. I feel kinda alone in dealing with my SO HCP so if you aren’t in denial about it then this already a major win! 

Nothing wrong with getting a therapist! Definitely read some books and write about your feelings/goals. "
"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by marked instability in functioning, affect, mood, interpersonal relationships, and, at times, reality testing. BPD is associated with significant morbidity due to common comorbid conditions, including dysthymia, major depression, psychoactive substance abuse, and psychotic disorders. Approximately 70-75% of patients with BPD have a history of at least one deliberate act of self-harm, and the mean estimated rate of completed suicides is 9%.[1, 2]

Sings and symtoms

Disturbances in experiencing oneself as unique, poor boundaries between self and others, and poor emotion regulation.

An inability to soothe themselves adequately, resulting in excess emotional reactions to stresses and frustrations; maladaptive attempts at self-soothing, suicide threats, self-harm, and angry behavior

An unstable sense of self with poor ability for self-direction and impaired ability to pursue meaningful short-term goals with satisfaction

Marked instability in functioning, affect, mood, interpersonal relationships, and, at times, reality testing

Disturbances in empathy and intimacy

A pattern of impulsivity, risk taking, and poor self-image

A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation

And the most important of them all
Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms


Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment; this does not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in criterion 5"
"I saw this the other day and saved it but only just got round to replying.
I used to get this as a child, also mostly when I had a temperature and it was almost exclusively when I was In bed (although I would get the weird shouting in my head sometimes in the shower too later in life - I kind of feel it now weirdly just reading this)

I fully get how it would be traumatising and I’m kind of surprised it didn’t traumatise me, unless I’ve just forgotten that. I have a vague recollection of feeling alone and trapped but I wouldn’t say I felt scared or anxious and if anything I would talk it up to people about how cool it was to feel my hands getting bigger and smaller.

I also used to get nightmares when I was ill, I’d be in a weird environment of cumuli coloured hills and mounds and I’d feel myself getting trapped in the valleys with the walls looming over me and the weird loud and incoherent voice shouting at me. 

It really is a strange condition and I was glad I was able to find out what it was years ago, I am surprised it hasn’t affected me more than it has, unless I haven’t realised yet.

Just last night I woke up and my head felt like it was in overdrive, no real thoughts in particular but there was some feeling whirring around and making me restless and uncomfortable. I’m wondering if this is part of it too and that is probably the symptom that has stuck with me most as I’ve got older, although it is still rare that it happens 

Would love to see any links to articles or studies about this if you have found anything interesting yourself "
A little journal for your thoughts is quite helpful.
Arguing with you is like playing chess with a pidgeon
But I mean that specific drug and at that dose range?
Christ! No. NO. It is NOT your fault. This kills me.
Go back to therapy and don't leave after one session?
Go see a doctor and get some mild anti-anxiety meds.
"Gonna try and get some sleep now, cat is preening me."
Have you looked into getting extended time on exams?
"Hey,

I'll send you a DM if that's cool?

Cheers

I have no idea how this is stickied or how to fix it.

Report him to faculty and trusted adults immediately.
"Same! Working out is the best, especially with music!"
Thank you. I think I should go see a therapist again
Thanks and good luck to you too. I wish you the best!
When you become a danger to yourself or other people.
"Wow, that would probably help tremendously. Thank you"
Yeah :/ these things usually don't go away overnight.
"Yes, god yes. I’m so happy for you. Keep it going. "
You have had a rough start. Interesting story though.

"&gt; So my question is, do you folks think its just severe and worsening dementia, or is something else mixed in there. Thanks alot!

Probably just dementia and at her age, this is not  uncommon.  If you haven't already done so, start looking for an assisted living facility.  They are trained to handle this."
"I have both technically. I do my therapy at a psychologist (she is not qualified to give me medicine) but I am required to get regular checkups at a psychiatrist (she gives medicine and justifies it to the insurance company). Technically I should be going to a psychiatrist but I like the lady,  she is nice. "
"Interesting. I suppose I practice the Eastern one the most. I live by the sea and when things get too much I sit by it and listen to the waves. 
I also write a stream of consciousness sometimes, just what follows naturally into the page without thinking too hard about it, which feels similar to this method. "
"Never met a therapist open on the weekends. 
I don’t take time to enjoy things, all my earnings from work go into saving for a house and a new vehicle. Thats life. 

Hobbies are too expensive to have.

I don’t enjoy life, every day is just a reminder that I’m one day closer to being old and then dead. "
"No one knows why they did it. A few people have asked, when they did the other friends got defensive and now people aren't willing to talk to them about it for fear of them also being cut out . I don't like the idea I'll never get over it, I'm having trouble holding it together. I feel like I lost my family."
"Not really advice that I had received, but there was one day I realized that while I have depression, I don’t have to BE depression. I could build myself into whatever shape I wanted, and I wanted to be happy or at least satisfied. And through medication and counseling, I am. It also helps that I keep busy"
"Thank you.

Iam afraid of how he would act in front of the counselor, I would be open to if they know that there’s a lot under the covers when it comes to his true personality, I want to leave this situation since it seems very unlikely he will ever want to change, I’ll be contacting a professional soon."
"They probably just want the best for you and want to aid your recovery, since they are obviously not helping let them know because they will just keep going if they think its helping but truly it isn't and they can't tell if you don't say anything to them. Good luck to you and hope you go on the mend soon :)"
"Umm, you're old enough to move but your mother controls your therapy?   I guess we need more information about what's going on.  You do need to talk to someone who is going to listen to YOU.  You should be able to figure that out, if not explain why your mother wont let you change therapists???  Dad around? "
"Yah probably long time ago tried to find people to play with and I use my username on a lot of stuff . Oh well pretty creepy you look me up tho fucking loser you have mother better to do? 

You are getting boring I want to go get stoned and play games lol can you actually not be boring or leave me alone lol "
You’re right. I have little compassion for people who intentionally endanger children and then still have the audacity to worry about how it affects them rather than the child. It’s the epitome of selfishness and indicates absolutely zero self-awareness. My advice for rehabilitation still stands however.
"BPD: mood triggered by emotional response.mood fluctuates within minutes/hours. Impulsivity. Black/white good/bad love/hate. Take everything personally.

BP: mood triggered by environmental stressors. mood fluctuation is more gradual. Hypomania to Mania to depression. Usually weeks/months/year. Rapid cycling/mixed episodes are mood fluctuations within manic and depressive episodes however it consists of irritable mania and depression/anger.

CPTSD: fear of abandonment causes a sense of detachment or pulling away vs BPD fear of abandonment leads to latching on"
"Has he had these symptoms throughout his life? Psychosis and related disorders normally present themselves in males in late teen years and early 20s. If not, it is more likely a medical issue at his age now. A urinary tract infection is the most common to create psychosis in older adults. If he was a heavy drinker, or consistently drank a regular amount daily, it could be wet brain, which can cause significant cognitive decline. So many parts of the body can create psychosis, it could be something as simple as a vitamin B deficiency. Hope some of this helps. "
"I do realize that.  I've been on meds that help me manage the depression enough to function,  am working with a counsellor and have a background in psychology as well as working in the field,  which has made me more skeptical and less patient in the past because I decided I was just going to outsmart anyone trying to help me and gave up on trying to grow.
My problems are within my realm of influence,  I can have an impact,  but I can't heal from them through isolating myself. I have a really hard time letting go of fault instead of looking at responsibility. "
"You don’t have to stick with the same therapist. If you don’t feel like the one you’re working with works for you, it’s completely ok to change. Also, you can request specific traits from your therapist. I was in my late 20’s/early 30’s in college and I hated seeing 21 year old therapists because I couldn’t connect with them, and they worked with me so I’d see therapists closer to my own age. In other words, take control of your treatment and vocalize what is and is not working for you so they can provide the best treatment to fit your needs. "
"Hope it helps her. It took me many years in therapy and 12 step programs to figure that out, since I had spoken harshly to myself since I was very young and it had become so ingrained that it was automatic. I know it can be difficult as a spouse to hear your SO say these things about themselves and to feel like no matter what you say they aren't able to hear how wonderful and valuable they are. For me it came from a place of trauma and frustration, and though I had therapists say I needed to practice self-compassion before, it didn't click until I was in the right kind of therapy. I had tried lots of things but EMDR therapy has helped me more than anything to heal the traumas. Whatever is causing your wife to feel this way about herself, I hope she's able to overcome. It's nice that she has a supportive hubby!"
"Hopefully this doesn't seem like I'm being harsh or nasty, because that's not my intention...

Stop trying to work up a mental illness.

Speaking as someone who is mentally ill and who also works in mental health, this isn't a game and it's not fun. It's not trendy or chic. It's really an awful thing to experience and it seriously impacts lives. People have died (and almost died) from mental illness.

You have a lot of folks so far telling you that you're probably fine. You get sad and angry sometimes, so what? No one is happy all the time. You're acting like you're almost disappointed that we're saying you're normal. 

But if you're actually worried *go to a therapist*. No one can diagnose you online. Maybe there IS something going on that you just aren't describing properly. *That's what therapists are for*."
"I have experienced this a lot. For me I believe it comes down to a combination of fear of losing something I care about (normal, but probably blown out of proportion) and low self esteem (caused by a childhood that made me feel like I am not worth much).

I don't experience it as often as I used to but it still does happen. It's most prevalent at the beginning of relationships, i.e. the times I'm most insecure about things, or when I feel I have the most to lose. If I found someone I truly loved I expect it'd happen more often.

It's a tough habit to break. I would guess therapy would help. I might find out soon depending on how things go - currently due to see a psychiatrist for the first time.

Either way, you can try to see it as a sign that you love your girlfriend. At least that's kind of a nice thing. :)"
"There is no scientific evidence, that cristals and essential oils work. They are a ripoff million maybe even billion dollar industry PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.

Here is a youtuber that talks about this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxgleiJW2Gk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxgleiJW2Gk)

"You need some sort of external pushing factor. Because all you do is play games and sit at home, I would recommend signing up for school to upgrade your diploma/degree. You won't really sacrifice anything to study anyway. 

I took a 2 year engineering diploma and had No free time due to all the studying. Now, after it's over, all I do is be productive and self improve, because I value my time so much. I completely dropped video games and watching shows/movies to read books instead.

Another tip I would give you is to MAN THE FUCK UP! All these people telling you that you're on the ""right path"" just don't have anything better to say. If you're feeling like you're not on the right path then YOU'RE NOT ON THE RIGHT PATH. Stop making excuses for yourself and start your progress with making your damn bed everyday. "
"I'm not an expert when it comes to this type of stuff. But what I can tell you is that I currently suffer from psychotic symptoms and apparently schizoaffective disorder. The difference for me is that I don't have hallucinations. I don't see anything that shouldn't be there. And I don't hear anything that shouldn't be there.

I suffer from mania from time to time too. When I do, I feel restless, agitated, paranoid, hyper, angry, etc. My sadness gets to the point where a lot of times I just lay in bed and stare at the wall all day. I tend to zone out as well because it's easier to disconnect yourself from the pain and suffering than it is to face it alone.

I can't tell you for sure what you've got. You're just going to have to keep going to your doctor. But it sounds to me like he's probably got the right diagnosis. Nobody on here can tell you exactly what you have. You're just going to have to keep going there and do whatever's necessary to get better.

edit: I wanted to add that I too suffer from severe delusions as well. So you're not alone in those regards."
"I’m so sorry this has happened. I hope he will get the help he needs. I was in his same position as a kid. As someone who’s gone through this, the biggest things i wish my mom would have done: 
1) Not Patronize my feelings 
———- when I was really upset, its horrible to hear “there are kids starving in Africa while you’re upset about your boyfriend.” Understand that it may not make sense to you, but their feelings are real to them. 
2) Ask me what I need
——— I had depression for a long time, and started family therapy later. I saw the greatest amount of progress was when my mom and I were able to talk together with a therapist about how I felt with things she did or other things. Although it’s not perfect, she stops herself if she finds herself belittling my feelings or if she’s overwhelming me with family problems.  Ask what kind of support your son needs. It could be therapy, tasks.  Being taken to activities, or just hugs and love. 
3) Be Patient 
It takes time. He will come to the realization that his relationship isn’t worth it, and that life is valuable and worth living. Don’t force him to recognize it. He’s gotta come to it on his own. Therapy helps a lot (as I’ve found personally) he may not outwardly show it, but that’s okay. It will come in time. 

I hope this helps! "
"My wife started out very similar to this,  she took up alcohol and pills a few years ago,  so now add addiction and new mental health issues as a result. 

That has led to me going to alanon, and I really wish I would have had some of the principles they teach. 

""I didn't cause it, I can't control it,  I can't cure it""

When she is having an episode don't try to fix it, don't internalize it, just be there and understand she is doing her best. 

""Not my circus, not my monkeys""

I'm not sure if your SO has any behavioral issues but I like this one to remind me that I don't have to protect my wife from her decisions. I need to step back and let her lead her life.  I can only be a partner, any attempt to save her is going to change the relationship to a parent. This stops her from learning better behaviors, and it destroys the equality that any healthy relationship is built on. 

Look up caretaking fatigue, make sure you don't forget to take care of yourself,  the best thing you can do for your SO is to make sure that when age really does need you,  you're as able to be a healthy, caring,  partner. 

If you let your life be absorbed by her mental illness then you're not going to be able to be the link to reality that she will need. You will be equally unable to think clearly as she will be.  This will help no one. "
"Sounds like depression to me. (Speaking from personal experience and research, but I'm not a professional.) There are other possibilities, too.

Try to identify when you started feeling this way and why. Usually, there is an event or series/group of events which make you slide down the slippery slope. If it's from a person or situation and that person is still in your life or the situation is still present, try to get away from them/it. I presume you have a certain event/person in mind because you said you don't want to feel pain. That's a very understandable cause.

There are tons of reasons for being anti-social, so that's not much of an indicator of anything specific.

&gt;there are some moments when i laugh for no reason even for not funny things i don't really know where's this laugh is coming from but if i had to guess i would guess that i get extremily bored and my mind just creates something to laugh at that it will no longer will be bored

That's very interesting. I've never heard of that.

You are right to show concern and introspect on yourself. If you don't ""grow out"" of feeling (or lack of feeling) in this way, you should talk to someone in your ""real life"" about it who has at least some education of mental health, and at that point I would recommend seeing a therapist (or the equivalent in France)."
A she in school? Convince her to talk to counselling.
Actually no. But hopefully You are on the right path.
Alcohol is not recommeded if you're depressed though!
"Cool, will give that a go if I get bored of Headspace."

so is being trans a mental problem or mental disorder?
"Hard to say, it isn't like the mania/depression of bipolar (though mind you I'm a layman on diagnoses).  Basically work out on paper what you are feeling, and any incidents where it's actually affected your life.  You'll probably come to terms pretty fast on it being an actual problem or just an idiosyncrasy."
I agree. Yeah no more drugs. I've completely stopped. and this morning felt more clear without. I'm sure there will be times like today where I think about wanting to take drugs. But you're right it isn't worth it. Definitely understanding more and growing up is the best thing i could. Gotta stay disciplined.
"I hate being dishonest, so.it has always bothered me to have to answer pleasantly to this, too. I've moved past it and now I just don't answer it and respond with a simple but cheery hello. I can fake a cheery greeting, but I'm not going to act like this person actually wants to know where I'm at emotionally."
"I live in a country that I don't yet speak the language of so the uni psychological services is my best bet for now. I will definitely check if they have limits like that. It seems very shitty of them to impose a limit like that, but did they refer you to additional services? What is your condition right now?"
"I was in the same boat as you, always felt like my depression and anxiety was more but couldn’t pinpoint it. Have you looked into CPTSD? Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The diagnosis brought me so much peace and made so many things make sense. I hope things get better for you, always here for a chat"
"I'm definitely working on upping my water intake, I hope that it is a cause because that's one that can be reversed. My sleep schedule is wonky. Sometimes I get 8 hours, then 3, then none, but the next day I'll nap for an hour and then get a good 6, and on the weekend I'll get 12. Maybe. Its hard to regulate."
"I'm high functioning BPD, which means that I'm able to function normally for the most part. When I'm having an episode, people are VERY thrown off. It's very confusing to many people, especially anybody I date. Within the hour I'm okay again, and that makes it even more difficult to explain. It sucks heavily."
"Not sure this is BPD. Doesn't really sound like BPD at all. Just a relationship that lacks mutual respect and communication. I would handle it by telling him I'm unhappy, and saying that I hope he is willing to work on our problems but if not, I can't live like this forever. Then I'd suggest couples therapy. "
OK...tell me what you're feeling. I might not be able to help much (having a BAD day) but I can listen and keep you company so you don't feel so lonely. :) Just message me. I am not doing anything fantastically interesting at the moment. I am playing Papa Pear on my phone and occasionally checking in here. :)
"Sometimes when I think of certain things, I brain starts to feel numb and tingling. This has been going on for the past few years. And sometimes when I have this feeling, it feels like I'm about to be knocked out. If you haven't already, I would schedule an appointment with a doctor and bring this up to them."
"Sunny, a repeating cycle of depression can be caused by a body chemistry change (as occurs with bipolar disorder), which is treated with medication that is intended to stabilize the body chemistry.  In the case of general depression, it typically is continual and is treated with antidepressants.

"Usually, dreaming of dying from a heart attack can be a sign of feeling a lack of support and acceptance from loved ones. Dreams of having cancer can represent repeatedly suppressed feelings of guilt and hopelessness due to a painful even/time period in your past. Dying of old age represents a new beginning. "
"Yeah, that's why I keep the journal.  I got the idea from listening to the philosopher Allan watts ,discussing the idea of self and meditation with the separation of the ego and the attman or higher self. The idea being that you do as you said take a step back and process your thoughts and feeling externally."
"I feel kind of different but the same! Except I can't seem to do long term or short term really well. I always feel like I'm missing something, constantly anxious over something I don't know about. I can't remember things people tell me to do a couple seconds earlier and I have to have them repeat it and they get annoyed but even if I think I remember I have to make sure because I haven't been able to trust my own memory. I can't remember who I was or who I am now so I don't know. I don't know anything lol :( I was thinking of trying memory training exercises "

"It sure is. You sound like an awesome person. We are like sponges, soaking up all the emotions around us. I had to learn to control it because it was messing with my already unwell-head. I had to learn to block out all the emotions coming in sometimes when I am feeling overwhelmed by them. :) It takes practice, but you can do it.

"Thank you! I have to confess, I just burned. I had to. I have a ""burn box"" which is a metal tin that I can safely burn paper towels, toilet paper, or papers (though I hate the smoke these give off and I am paranoid that the kids will smell it--so I try to keep my door closed and ventilate my room well)...and earlier today, I went up to the woods and burned stuff there. It is very wet out, so it was safe to burn. The grass/weeds were all too wet to catch. I feel ashamed that I had to do that...but then again, it felt AWESOME. I can listen to you anytime too. :)"
"something i like to do to help is just do tasks very spread out. it sounds like you might not have too much free time coming soon, but i like to brush my teeth in the morning, brush my hair if i have to, then go to school and/or work come home do anything i want or have to (such as school work) brush my teeth. do any hobby of mine then take a shower. instead of just waiting to the end of the day to do everything, spreading it out sometimes helps. it’s almost like telling your brain “oh quick timeout for 5 minutes gotta do this and then we can come back.”"
"the thing that screws with me is I can carry on just fine for years at a time. when I was younger I would black out and wake up in different places but that hasn't happened in a long while. so I don't know if I've healed of if I've gotten /really/ good at repressing my emotions. I don't feel much of anything for anything anymore. I'm scared that I'm somehow faking it all and I'm not sick, I just like attention or something. But then if I'm even talking about it like this it's gatta be effecting me in some way I would think.. honestly never been more confused. "
"General nurses don't receive the same level of training as mental health nurses. And to be fair, calling an ambulance yourself suggests at least regret in your actions, not that you shouldn't be taken seriously, but you're definitely in the lower risk bracket. 
Nurses are allowed to vent frustration but this should never be done in front of the patient. 
There are a finite number of beds available. She won't be the only suicide attempt that comes through the doors. The sad reality is that nurses have to decide who really needs that bed. 
The poor state of mental health services in the UK is down to a lot of reasons (funding, lack of staff, unsafe work conditions) but least of all the professionalism of the NHS staff, who if you spend a few minutes on most wards, you'd see are genuine heros working for peanuts. "
"To give you a thing to think about as you move forward - if you are growing out of these friendships, what are you growing into? There are people who terminate friendships because they no longer can maintain the lifestyle/opinions/needs of their friends and there are people who terminate friendships because they want to isolate themselves. The first situation is usually fine, the second situation is often a red flag - if you terminate most/all of your friendships you lose a lot of your support system, change your habits, and (usually) increase your impulsivenes (since you don't have a sounding board). That is behavior of concern.

If you are gaining new friends/groups/activities while you lose old friends, it's probably not a concern. If you are leaving a hole in your daily/weekly life, that might be a concern."
"Could be. It's impossible for us to tell you, honestly. You need to talk to a professional, but I can tell you I do something similar. I daydream a lot about things that definitely won't happen. I have bipolar disorder, but it's not usually seen as a sign or symptom of that. Maladaptive daydreaming isn't officially a disorder, but my daydreaming is pretty close to that.

I used to fantasize about similar things when I was younger and extremely poor. Now it's imagining I made better choices in my 20s and have jobs or degrees I could have gotten if I hadn't screwed things up.  Or sometimes it's something even more fictional like I live in a golden age of space exploration or some magical new reality.

You seem like you understand that your daydreams aren't 100% and there's a chance you can't obtain things you imagine (even if you hope they will or believe parts of them could/might come true), so you might be grounded enough for a professional to tell you it's not a big deal. Even if your daydreams are intrusive and waste time. That's been my experience with them. "
"Haha my friend I wash pipes for a living but my sister is in a similar field as you and I can tell you if you we're told you did a good job then you did.

Time is money and compliments are equally consuming so consider your compliments at least worth the effort to make them.

Seriously though you sound pretty new to your job, I'd say 6 months so even if you aren't doing the best job that you can just think that your superiors were very probably in your position several decades ago and the motions you go through will be the same as them.

They see you doing a good job and they tell it as it is. You care so you stress about doing good leading to you caring so you care but stress about it and the loop continues.

Truth of the matter is that nobody really knows 100% what they're doing because then they'd be people not pushing their limits and while that may be a significant percentage of the population the fact that we both care about going the extra mile means that we are by default outside of what the general consensus is.

Keep whipping yourself everytime you make a mistake because you can do better every time so when you think about it then you will but remember because you think and act upon making yourself better at  your field eventually you will become your respective best.

Best of luck to you and God bless."
"I lost someone close to me as well so I know how that goes. :/

A strict routine helps me - exercise every day (it doesn't have to be much), wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, eat regularly and healthily, meditate, and stay busy with work or hobbies.

If I stick to my routine (which I do pretty well these days) then I take away a huge amount of burden on my mind and body because I'm satisfying the basic requirements to be physically and mentally healthy. That means I have fewer things to distract me from working on my issues, and I'm in a much better place to do it.

I know that the biggest hurdle in all of this is finding the motivation to do it, but remind yourself that you've posted here because you want help, so you definitely do want to get better. Ignore the fact that you might not want to do these things and do them anyway, even if you don't feel like it's making an immediate difference. Some regularity in your life will help to ground you and give you a sense of measured progress.

Also strongly agree with what another commenter said about finding local support groups - this could be a huge step forward for you as it might help you really make progress with this tragic loss you're going through.

Just focus on the basics for now and try to be good to yourself. And carry on talking to us. :)"
Buy a cheap punching bag. Release your anger onto that.
Do you WANT to do this or are these intrusive thoughts?
"Good luck! 

Hit me up if you need help with anything. "
"I click on it every so often, just to cost them money. "
"I would not jump to APD, thats a disregard for everyone"
I would say I relate more to my grandmother. Thanks man
"I'm interested, diagnosed with PTSD &amp; depression :)"
If anything it makes me happier but sometimes I get sad
In my case I made threats that I would commit suicide.
It's sad and comforting to find this post so relatable.
I’ve been thinking of attacking people with a hammer
Lavender oil or valerian root oil could be of interest
"Lol. At least I know this is not just me, I'll take it!"
"Thank you, it’s nice to hear that from someone else. "
Thank you. I'll do my best to put this into practice!!
Thanks for sharing this. Does it happen often for you??
"Thanks for your 2 cents, will keep your advice in mind!"

Who you want to fill this out? Consumers? Carers? Both?

You could sneak in a kitten? Or even a small fish tank?
You really really really REALLY need to go see a doctor
You're welcome! Let me know if anything else comes up!
Your never going to just acciddently ingest lsd. Relax
can you go into a little more depth about what you mean
"sorry buddy. you'll get over it, time heals all wounds."
"understandable, hope things start to get better though."
"I can't say whether or not it's considered ""normal."" I've never had to go through this before. But the only way you'll ever get over this and get it out of your system, is by going to therapy. You need to get these thoughts out of your head. And by going to therapy, you'll have the opportunity to do just that."
"I have them all the time now! When I see my baby cousin, and when I talk to my boyfriend, when I look at the trees changing colour, when I realize that I’m in university now and I’m going to be something, when I sew, etc. It’s been a year since the worst of it, though I never actually attempted anything."
"I lost my dad who suffered with schizophrenia on October 27, 1997 to suicide. It’s a tough journey but it will get easier with time. Just keep talking about him, as the native American proverb goes: _you live as long as the last one to remember_, so as long as you spread the word they’re never truly gone. "
"I'm not a doctor but sounds like you could benefit from visiting one. Maybe therapy could help with controlling the negative thoughts. I know it's helped with my depression a lot. 

Leaving a state of being you've been in for a long time can be scary, but getting to the other side has been so worth it for me. "
"Oh alright. I was just wondering because I suffer from paranoia and delusions. Like how people are out to get me. Or how people are plotting against me. I also believe that anything somebody says or does, whether it's good or bad, is directed towards me. So it's very difficult for me to be around other people."
"Sadly, this doesn't sound like a good match for friendship. Your friend may mean well but may not be capable of giving you what you need. 

You have issues and he has issues, but one of his issues appears to be an inability to respect yours, and I really don't see how you can do anything about that. I'm sorry."
They take them down because they don't want you to be happy. That's also how depression works. You don't want other people to be happy because you aren't. They have no clue how to be happy either. There aren't many who are truly happy. I can't harm you with words. Only you can harm yourself by how you think.
"This shit really sucks man it's ruined my entire life, trust me. I can't run anymore or do anything I used to enjoy and now with them telling me that everything I've worked for and tried to do is gone because of some technicalities, I'm just in shock. I don't feel like myself at all, almost like I'm in a dream"
"When I tell people I am schizophrenic, they automatically think that I am violent and/or dangerous, and that I will behave strangely. Even though I’ve never been like that prior to telling them. It hasn’t made me embarrassed to say I have schizophrenia, but rather more aware of how I explain my condition. "
"ok... thank you, alot, I usually don't think about it when I'm around my friends, I'm just gonna try to fill my life with more positive things and pray whoever was doing what they did gets locked up for what they did, I'm gonna change everything for the better, this opened my eyes to how fucked up our world is"
"""Psychosis"" is a broad term but many people with mental illness experience dissociation, a feeling like they lost connection with reality.

You are to be commended for trying to be there for your bf. Please be sure you understand that what you are describing are serious conditions, you are young, and you may be dealing with this for years or decades to come. I am not telling you to dump your bf, just preparing you that this isn't the sort of thing that easily gets fixed and then it's over. I apologize if that sounded patronizing as that is not my intent at all."
"I don't think it's all about them not understanding the way we think. That's definitely involved in the negative appraisal part, but ADD/HD has symptoms that are unrelated to other people. Like, hey I've had asthma since I was a kid and I still can't remember to bring my inhaler unless I make a list. Oh hey, here's something I totally love and am sure that it's what I want to do for the rest of my life. What, that thing? Bah I got over that last year. I was supposed to be here what time? What do you mean I shouldn't have said that, I thought it was funny? Etc. "
"I think you have a combination of low self esteem and fear of intimacy. but if you resist the closeness, the fear will persist. so just go and engage with some people, even if you're not feeling it right away or even if you end up not digging it, just keep grinding on that, to escape the paradox of living in fear of something and unable to decide whether you want it or not. worst case scenario is wasted time that at least wasn't wasted on something less boundary pushing, and best case scenario is a healthy connection that can aid in your inner chilled out-ness."
"Make it a part of an already-established routine. Extending a routine is easier than creating a whole new one. My routine when I get to work is to get all my work stuff out of my locker, check my bag for work stuff, put the bag in the locker, put all the work stuff on my desk, and start working. I just shuffled 'check bag for meds' into the 'check bag for work stuff' step.

Sometimes I don't take the meds for several hours, but I leave the doses on my keyboard so I keep seeing them and at some point I'll actually remember them when I have a moment to take them."
"Nothing obviously traumatic and no neglect but he does have an of relationship with his dad. He always calls him by his first name and I get the impression his dad was very dismissive. Very likely something around that and worrying about himself as a father. 

It’s scary not knowing what is coming next.

Thank you, I have not been patient and loving through all of this! This has come after months of pain and torture. I am trying really hard to do what is best for him but I so desperately want him to com back to his family so we can love and take care of him. "
"Okay, understood. It's probably not what you want to hear so I'm sorry if this frustrates you, but my opinion is that any diagnosis you could come up with yourself based on your own research would not be helpful and could potentially be very dangerous, so I feel obliged to discourage you from doing that.

One way or another, this man needs professional help so, if you want to help, I can only advise that you focus on getting him that help.

Again, sorry if this frustrates you, I am only offering the best advice I can and it is meant with the best of intentions."
"That's dissociation. Your brain is checking out because it is overwhelmed, and it will keep checking out because of the trauma you've had to face in your life. Don't go anywhere near mindfulness, I dissociate a lot and mindfulness made it a lot, lot worse (like checked out and gone for I don't know how long until pain brought me back). You want grounding techniques, therapy (my psychologist helped me stay present to discuss horrible shit) and most importantly, recognise when you're about to go. That's helped me stop dissociating quite as badly. Hope this helps!"
"That's fantastic, except you don't have a state license, you have a temporary license because you haven't finished your training. A fucking flair on a random subreddit is not going to convince me that you're a professional. Even if you are, the fact remains, you are terrible at your job and are behaving extremely inappropriately.

And, again, if you were doing nothing wrong, you'd have no problem with me making a complaint about you.

Sounds like your skills as a writer are about as good as your skills as a ""counselor"", given your complete inability to succeed."
"This happens to me as well, you're not alone. What I do to snap me back into reality is doing an exercise where I use my senses. I touch something, smell something, see something, and taste something. You have to really feel what's around you to come back to who you are. I also start listing facts about myself and that really helps. For example I'll say outloud ""my name is _, I'm _years old, I live in _ city, my favorite color is _, my best friend is _."" and so on. Hope this helps some. I know it's really scary to look in the mirror and not recognize yourself. "
"honestly, based on this post, i think you're angry because you're feeling hopeless. ""nobody understands me. everyone leaves. what's wrong with me."" those are the three thoughts that you finished this post with. It seems like you're frustrated because you WANT things to get better, but it feels like they're not. I can relate to that. it's incredibly jarring. You prolly just need a good cry honestly lol, that's what always helps me when i'm seething with anger. brings me right down. because usually, the anger is just a surface emotion of a million other emotions."
"https://youtu.be/UugEXRMYXoE 

This video has good information about trauma. 

Things that might not seem that traumatic at the time can have later effects on your mental health. You also can have trauma without PTSD. 

But, at the end of the day I wouldn't think that much into it. In my opinion therapists throw around the word trauma a lot. It's because most people do have things that have happened to them  that effect them. Every experience we have shapes us, sometimes for the worst. Don't feel you have to label yourself as 'traumatised' if you dont want to. "
"Honestly, I'm low functioning and people don't take me seriously. I've been hospitalized twice this year, and people expected me to just go back to functioning like a normal person as soon as I got back. 

I can barely do the things I need to do to survive. 

It's hard and it sucks. People don't take mental health seriously, and that's how suicide claims so many lives. It's not fair at all. But what you can do is surround yourself with people like us who know what it's like and who do take it seriously and who do believe you. 

Also, if your professionals aren't listening to you, have you tried talking to someone else? Sometimes it takes a while to find a therapist that works for you, but it's so worth it. I'm still struggling to get back on my feet, but I feel hopeful again because of the therapist that I have."
"I grew up with severe childhood trauma and as a result, have anxiety and CPTSD now. 
What you’ve explained is how I feel everyday for over 8 years now, every psych I’ve seen has attributed it to being derealisation/depersonalisation, with some depression mixed in too. 

I’ve recently been doing some exercises where I’m to really feel parts of my body by noticing them; eg. feeling my feet flat on the floor while sitting and describing how the ground feels ect.
My psych believes this is a grounding technique that brings you back into yourself, so you can therefore connect with your emotions more freely. 

It’s not working yet and I know I need to go on medication, but I’m trying everything else first. 

It’s really shit feeling like you and everything around you doesn’t exist, so I feel your pain. "
Perhaps if you are in something that makes you so miserable is a sign to make a change. Everyone and everything does get better though. I have witnessed it some many times in my own life. I've been in many dark places where all I had the strength to do is cry. Nothing else mattered at that point. It made me not only feel weak but hollow. It felt like something inside of me broke. Like there was no end to the torment or suffering.  But after a time it did get better. There are so many things to try to improve your situation that you may not have thought of. But staying strong and working through this is what makes you the person you are. To come as far as you have and to lay down your heart like this is a big first step. Continue to make steps like this and you will find you have the strength to work through this

It's all in how you interpret it. YOU read it that way.
Just go to the hospital now. Tell them how bad you are.
Just wondering - are you diagnosed and treated for ADHD?
"Mentally ill people can be toxic, it’s just how it is "
Nah man. Therapy can help anyone if they're open to it.

Okay good. That's a good mindset to have. Stay positive.
Okay. Well good luck with everything. You'll be alright.

"Because suicidal thoughts/ideation, self harm, potentially homicidal thoughts are part of a lot of these diagnoses. Without a system to address these, what are you going to do if someone told someone they were going to kill them selves on your chat and nothing happened and then they went and killed themselves. "
"I don't have anyone to talk to in real life either...so I understand completely. My eldest daughter is so judgemental and my hubby is not even supportive. He wanted to leave me in the psych hospital last time I was there. He didn't want to come for me. That killed me inside. :(  


I am sending lots of huggles!"
"I have a similar episode sometimes, but instead of my mind clearing, it's more that I ""go numb"" and stop feeling anything. I feel extremely apathetic, and I don't care about my wellbeing. I try not to leave my bed because I've accidentally hurt myself by not paying enough attention to my surroundings that way. "
"I was just getting offended that people were joking about something  AWFUL that I had gone through (almost died twice). I never joke about suicide anymore and I get angry when people bring it up, especially jokingly. I also self-harm and have a list of other mental health issues...and none of them are funny. :("
"If drinking would make you just drink more, think about the soul-shattering anxiety that comes from withdrawals. Think about the oftimes life-destroying carnage that surrounds the horror of drinking. Think about just how bad it really is, and try to remember a time it EVER did anything good--I'll bet you can't."
"There's a strong correlation between insufficient sleep and mental illness. But it's complex because each can cause the other.

I personally can ""buffer"" one night of insufficient sleep after several of the correct amount. The more nights in a row that I don't get enough, the more likely I am to have a bad day."
"Uni Zurich haha, admittedly I handled the situation there quite poorly. But I would prefer to keep that private.  

My so did approach a guy who is currently dealing w depression and actually asking on advice about me. Unfortunately that is all I know but I am sure I can ask him and he would be open to answer. "
"I feel like people have depression for a reason (s).  Not just for no reason. And yes, I feel many people with depression are often sad, have/had thoughts of suicide/self harm, etc. The thing is is I want to go out and do this and that, and up until recently I still was. It’s just the exhaustion has totally sidelined me. And unless I was predetermined from birth to develop depression , Which still wouldn’t make much sense. 

I’ve spent much time on multiple anti-depressants, and all they’ve done is made me more tired. Even after months and months of use "
"I hear ya. I have horrible anxiety which causes me to care waaaay too much about how I present myself in public. So yeah -- I show up on time to my appointments, I actually show up an hour early and sit in my car and practice every possible interaction I might have when going in and go over it over and over in my head. I also wear clean clothes and put make up on, but that doesn't mean I don't also go a week without showering and lay in bed 20 hours out of the day. I'm fucking sick and need help, but because I ""clean up well"" in public, I'm not taken seriously. "
"It helps that we live together and are happily married :) I have brought her several books to read in the hospital and visit 2 times a day. I'm focusing on making her feel safe again. It's so hard to watch someone you love struggle with mental health problems. She fears the strong social stigma that is attached to mental ill health and ""Getting Help"". So far it looks like I am doing ok. I brought her a few puzzles, books, and comfy slippers. We have already discussed her seeing a therapist regularly once she is home.

Thanks for the information :) "

"Sounds like your mother is the reason for your mental illness. 

My mother was my first bully as well. I was relentlessly bullied ALL my life. The horrible things she and others said to me as a child became my inner dialogue as an adult. Therefore I often feel as though I am worthless, disgusting, and the only one to blame for my hopelessness and unhappiness.

Don't let her or anyone blame you for being who you are. You should not blame yourself either. Mental illness is NEVER your fault.

I wish you healing and comfort on your journey through this. Blessed be.

"You may want to check out r/narcissisticabuse and google love bombing and dating a narcissist. Like u/supermodel-robot said if he doesn’t want to go to therapy it doesn’t matter what he realizes. Because none of it ever changes. And if he thinks you’ll leave or that he doesn’t need you, he’ll use tactics like the manipulation you mentioned and it’ll be an incredibly traumatic experience. Stay safe and consider taking some of the suggestions of commenters. Things like codependent dating and narcissistic partners are a good place to start researching. "
"I still think it could be sleep paralysis, I used to get it and you will have recurrent episodes through out the night. I think it actually happens at the point where you are just falling asleep.

For me by body would freeze, I think I also felt pressure on my chest ( perhaps from not being able to breath). I’d have pretty terrifying hallucinations, often of things tying to get me. One time I had a girl either side of me chanting ‘white surpemacy’ Another time a pink bubble came in the window and floated above me.

It would always leave me scared, often to the point where I didn’t want to feel asleep. Often id be worried it would happen again, then when o did I’d be like oh god here we go again.

Triggers for it use to be 
Changes in medication
Recreational drug use 
Times of great stress and anxiety.

"Hey, sorry to hear about what you've been going through. Despite what you might read, BPD isn't a life sentence and many people effectively recover from it (known as 'BPD in remission'), and there's every possibility you will too. It's essential you have the right support system in place: talk to trusted people about your diagnosis, look at support groups, join the r/BPD sub. And key to controlling those impulses will be reflecting and understanding what causes you distress and drives you to behave in a self-destructive way. I don't know if you drink or take drugs but I really can't trust myself when I'm not sober; so for me, a big part of managing my BPD is managing the day to day self-destructive impulses (drinking, drug-taking etc.) which in turn make me less likely to self-harm or indulge in suicidal ideation. Considering the volatile maelstrom the combination of intense emotional sensitivity and a tendency to behave impulsively this is easier said than done, but I'm working on it. I hope things become more manageable for you. I have every faith you can do it!"
"We don't know exactly everything that's going on but you are for sure not going crazy. I was in your situation as well, thinking I developed some psychological issues or something, but it turns out I've been having ""quiet"" acid refluxes the whole time. I didn't feel heartburn, but I had this severe urge to gag and vomit all the time. Anything I would put in my mouth would make me gag, and brushing my teeth felt gross and extremely uncomfortable. Long story short, at this point I believe I developed a sensitivity to gluten and all grains. And the gaging and urge to vomit dissapear when I avoid those foods. The reason why gum might be giving you relief is that the mint in the gum might be acting as an antacid, which lowers the stomach acidity, but I have to warn you that in the long run it's not good for you and it's not the solution. I don't know what your diet is like, but I would visit a GI doctor, avoid the stress and fix my diet. 

When I first found out that your stomach can develop allergies and sensitivity just by being under stress, I could not believe it. "
"Because you are NOT your depression. There really is so much more to life (I know this is sort of cliche). I almost died twice by my own hand, and I had questioned this also right after I had gotten out of the psych hospital the second time. I was still depressed as hell, wondering why I had been ""spared"", etc. etc.  I started going to therapy and to my psychiatrist, and we talked about these things. Then something happned: one day I got up and instead of feeling gloom and doom, I felt pretty okay. Bad things happened that day, but for some reason, I was able to work through them. I looked around me and saw how much love I had surrounding me and I felt...good. There are still some bad days where I want to kill myself (just recently...I will get to that) or just wonder what's the point, but most days, I can truly look at the flowers and see how beautiful they are.  


I guess I can actually kind of ask the same question: why should I live with this awful demon that I have in my head now? I actually got to a low point just a few days ago where I seriously wanted to die. I self-harmed (hadn't done that in 3 years!) and I just hated myself. Why? I was just diagnosed with a ""rare"" (for my age and gender) disorder called pyromania. I am a fire-bug, basically. Obsessed with fire to the point that it is all I think about. I have urges which turn into compulsions to light fires that I can't control all the time. It is awful being in my head sometimes because I feel like I am always on the verge of arson (I would NEVER intentionally set a building on fire though!)...just so I could see those lovely flames. It is so hard to live with sometimes, but I fight it and I know that going back to therapy is going to help me learn what my disorder is about and how to control it.   


Sorry if I bored you there, but my story isn't that different from yours. I question life sometimes, but I always find a reason to keep on fighting. I hope you can too. It really is worth it. :)  


If you need to talk, I am usually around, lurking and answering people here. You can message me anytime. &lt;3"

I wish good luck to you and your support family. Sorry for my delay in responding, this is my first time sharing this and I have a smidgeon of nerve. "
"Honestly, it's easier said than done.

It's not totally about self-improvement, but I have found recently that focusing on your behaviour and the way you interact with others is a far better way of dealing with disappointment and the anxiety/self-esteem issues caused by any (perceived) loss of relationships etc."
I can relate to this a lot. As my condition appeared I tried to reach out. Unfortunately people drifted away due to the complexity of my needs. I did learn to encourage a select small group of friends to share our issues between us so as to prevent any one person creating a burden so to speak on a single person.
"I do understand. I used to be suicidal back in college, but I found the Lord and He solved my problems. She's not even willing to try. Like I've said before, we've done everything we can, but there comes a point where I have to focus on the rest of my family as opposed to everything being about her all the time."
"I had brain zaps coming off of Wellbutrin and Lexapro. They are the weirdest thing and they did go away. Sometimes they were pretty mellow, but other times they were strong enough to make my head involuntarily move. I’m glad that you’re seeing your GP and I wish you the best of luck in getting better. ��"
I've only done group therapy in psych wards. But they were fairly nice experiences for the most part. I can't guarantee that it will help you. But it wouldn't be a bad idea to try it out at least one more time. You just need to force yourself to open up during the sessions. That's the only way they can help you.
It is possible to take it a step further and let someone in an even higher position know? It sounds like management isn’t doing their job properly and dropping the load on you. Emphasise that this way they will lose their valuable employees. Anyone else there feeling the same way that would be able to testify?
"It really is awful. I’m the queen of distraction. I come off as rude at times because I just look like I’m scrolling my phone, but in reality I’m just trying to take my mind off of whatever is causing my anxiety at the moment. I do like 20 sudoku puzzles a night, maybe more because it requires brain power."
"Just an FYI: You don't have to get off medications when you are trying to get pregnant or are pregnant.

"Not a North American. I don't get it, with a nationalized healthcare system, I thought that social services will be more integrated with it, but it doesnt seems to be the case here?

Welp, thats fcked up."
"One of the most insidious symptoms of depression is the convincing yourself that you feel this way not because you're ill, but because you are weak. And you can play ALL KINDS of mental gymnastics with yourself to convince yourself that that's the case, and that in of itself is ACTUALLY A SYMPTOM OF DEPRESSION. "
"Stress is indeed bad for the brain (the organ) but your problem only seems related to your thoughts and emotions which make your mind, not your brain per se.

I don't know what else to say because I didn't quite understand if you have any other question or what else you expect us to react to but feel free to ask"
When I was in my psychotic break I hallucinated I was like living fire? It's weird to explain but I could like see the fire on my arms and my legs but it didn't burn. TOTALLY outweighed by the negative hallucinations though. I think it has to do with the delusion and paranoia just rampant in the hallucinations.

"I’m not a doctor, but if your mom had to stop you from punching someone - as in, you were actually going to do it, not just afraid of doing it - that sounds less like OCD and more like something else, though I’m not 100% sure what. But if they viewed you as agitated/agressive that would explain the ativan. 

ERP therapy is the gold standard for obsessive thoughts/OCD. I think your best bet is to admit to a therapist what’s going on and see what types of exercises they can have you do. I also suffer from OCD and therapy has been what has helped me the most. "
"Therapy is a two-way thing, so you absolutely need to be communicate, open and willing to discuss things. It definitely isn't the kind of situation where you wait by for things to be pried out of you. However, there needs to be a rapport, and the therapist needs to work to make you feel as comfortable as possible in order to make you actually want to start spilling forth all of the pains and secrets of your existence. If you've done all you can on your part, or if things just don't feel ""right"" with your particular therapist, I'd say go in search of another one. "
"Are you doing this taper on your own or under guidance of your doctor? SSRI withdrawal is like the flu. Like the worst flu ever. So dizziness could fall under that I suppose. However, at 1.25mg you are basically on a placebo dose. I’ve never heard of anyone taking anything smaller than 5mg. And if you aren’t having any other withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, headaches, body aches, etc) then it may or may not even be related. I’m NOT a doctor but you could stop taking that 1.25 and you should not be experiencing any withdrawal. SSRIs take a few weeks to fully clear your system so taking that teeny tiny dose is really just dragging things out. 

As far as the panic you describe, if it was not present when you were on your full dose and now it is, that could just be a sign that the medication was helping. "
"I feel miserable too OP. I've been like this for years. Years and years and years of pain. Decades of sadness. And a lifetime of self-hate. 

You can still live a good life. You just have to force yourself to get the help you need. Are you currently seeing a doctor right now? Or a therapist? If not, then that should be your first step towards recovery.

Also, start exercising. Working out is an amazing coping method for depression and other mental illnesses. However it takes awhile to see physical progress. So don't give up at first.

Force yourself to get out of the house. Again, go to the gym. Go to the library. Go to the park. It doesn't matter what it is, you need to stay productive. Keeping busy will help take your mind off your problems.

You can overcome this. But you'll have to put in the effort to do so.
"
"I think it’s human nature for most to want to help someone they see struggling. So it’s probably as frustrating to them(the ones who cut you off) when they can’t help you in the way that they’d like. I can also see how a lot of the things people say or do is a little antagonizing. 

F*ck the stigma around mental health. I use to have similar concerns or afraid that I’d be labeled a nut case if I went to therapy. I found that validation is a huge key factor for me at least. I think we’ve all heard that cliche saying “well others have it worse” or “it could have been worse” which ironically makes you feel worse. 

It’s nice that you were able to get your therapy situation set up in that way. And I’m glad you have a friend who checks in on you regularly. She sounds like a really sweet person! "
"Nobody believes me. My friends obsess with films and tv shows where the character is struggling with substance abuse and mental unhealth and it's cool and everything, but when they ask me how I am they want me to say I'm fine although they know I go to the psychiatrist and psychologist regularly - who don't listen and don't believe what I say and now I'm isolated for two weeks and haven't had a shower or changed my clothes or done the dishes or the laundry or fed myself, going on long nightly walks half wishing to be attacked by a rapist so that I can kill him, obsessing about guys on tinder who wrote to me and they have no idea for a moment they're the most important person in my life because I have nobody. But maybe I'm only a lazy mean bitch and nothing is really going on in my head except wishes to be special."
"Wait...there is a NAME for this? I get SO anxious before my period (I have it now, but it is going away thank GOODNESS!!), feel like I am on edge (more than usual), I can't sit still or concentrate...and the weirdest thing happens. My sense of smell goes off the charts. I mean I almost could rival a bloodhound, and I am not exaggerating. Small smells (confirmed by other people in the house) become almost unbearable, depending on what the smell is. The litterbox (we have a cat) becomes the smelliest thing ever and I can barely tolerate it.   


0\_0 I am supposed to see my OBGYN soon (NOOOO!!!!!!) so maybe I will ask about this. I am 47 so it won't be much of an issue much longer. I am strange in that I am actually looking forward to menopause and NOT having my stupid period anymore. AHAHA. Bye red-headed witch. :D"
"Your description of this is amazing and is exactly how I felt. I didn’t even know the term for it until a week ago and until last week I just assumed it was a normal thing. I’m only 15 years old right now, but I remember experiencing exactly this when I was around 7-12 years old. 

Most of the time it would be after I wake up from naps and suddenly the walls seemed stretched and my bed seemed to grow several feet wider. I remember one time I was crying because I thought my parents had been fighting due to how loud they were talking but it turns out they were talking normally. Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night and my blinds would stretch like towers and the clock sounded like a giant stomping on the ground.

I don’t remember how long those sessions had usually last but it seemed like forever."

"Don’t feel like an idiot. So many of us have been there. I know I have. I spent actual years trying to “get over it” and sometimes really thinking I was until we were face to face again. But I kept living my life. And then one day, not for any particular reason, it struck me that I really was “over it.”"
"Eh sounds like it might not be the right one for you, most docs say to give it a week or 2 I think, but if it’s making you feel shitty and weird then go ahead and make an appointment to try something different.

It took me like 4-5 different meds to figure out what worked for me. Zoloft and prozac fucked me up."
"Haha you’re right, the phrasing was a little funny as there is the sentiment of both words in there. I will edit for clarity.  To clarify for you, I meant “unfortunately she is unlikely to be admitted, due to a shortage of mental health care” not “unfortunately she is not in imminent danger of suicide.”"
"How do you feel the rest of the day? From my experience when feeling numb most of the time sometimes any strong emotion feels nice. Letting all the emotion out can do wonders for mental health, as long as you can find a non-harmful (to you or anyone/thing else) outlet. There's nothing wrong with feeling emotions!"

"I get the feeling. You're going to have your highs and lows with depression inevitably, and not feeling happy or sad is what my therapist describes as ""flat lining"". It's definitely a part of your depression, and would advise you to talk to someone you trust if not your family and friends or a school counsellor. "
"Is because I don't have any problem with saying who I am. I really don't like anonymatous and I like (in this more serious topics) express who I am. I don't know why, but I prefer it that way, I guess that is so you can know it because... I don't know. I don't have a reason, I just like presenting myself I guess."
"I’m not sure if this is always the case but in the two instances I have had to call them this has happened. It might be judged on a case by case basis, maybe accessing your past medical history. Both times speaking to them really helped me, they were fantastic on the phone, a lot better than the Samaritans imo."
"People imitate others when they want them to like them, you may have an issue with confidence or self esteem. Trying something new and succeeding can give you that. But speaking with a professional in person will clear up a lot of what you may be going through, the internets suggestions are just that, find a PhD."
"Thank you ❤️ I'll keep that in mind.
How do you do eye exercises? I'm a little unsure how to do that..

It's just really hard.. Being a student and trying to cope with this and I just feel a little hopeless. There's so much ready and so much looking at screens and I just want to be able to do that, you know? "
"Thanks. I will do my best to remember that when I am with them.

They were held for a month, and I think they just weren't able to justify continuing to hold them anymore. I'm not really sure what can be done at this point - the hospital just released my friend onto the street in pajamas and a pair of sneakers :/"
"That's true we are both going through work / financial stress and he keeps saying if we weren't so broke he'd be more energetic, lol. It's just that during this time we need to step up to life demands even more, you know? Any way to help with sleep quality and energy even during a stressful time would be amazing."
Wtf. You are speaking bullshit if you are saying someone does not want to die because they would have been dead 'because they would have done earlier as they can from the age of 12'. Oh man that is such a load of crap. Many people kill themselves in every age group. Even kids under the age of 12 kill themselves.
"You’re not to blame. You loved her and treated her the best you could. I believe a relationship is more about compatibility than love. Go about your life and go on dates when you’re ready. With each lesson, we’ll learn more about what kind of partner is most suitable for us. And that’s only a good thing! "
"Believe it or not, many people have similar fantasies. I just wanted to feel sure that you were not actually going kill people. 

I believe that we are all equal, no is more or less important. You are super valuable, even if you have thoughts that other people don’t talk about having. 

If you have the funds and the time, you might want to explore this with a therapist. There is no shame in seeking help for your mental health. If it wasn’t for psychiatry, I have no idea if I would be dead, in prison, etc. 

Thank you for being honest about your time thoughts. "
"I could agree with this. I probably rely on others' perceptions of me since my own is kind of skewed low. I should trust my gut more for sure.

This is a good one. I'll keep this in mind. Weighing my situations out.

As for that playing my insecurities through, that makes a lot of sense. If I truly am what I fear I am, it's who I am. If I feel the need to change, I will but on my own accord. But maybe not even. You're certainly right. Focus on what I can control.

Thank you very much. I appreciate the advice. It'll definitely help me push through the insecurities."
"I, too, have Asperger's and life has been hard for me too. I had NO social skills up until a couple decades ago. When I was in my 20s I learned how to talk to people, look them in the eye, etc. and it has helped. DogGirl666 is absolutely correct that it is a foreign language. I still don't seek out social situations and I am pretty sheltered because I don't like people around me (anxiety also)...but if I have to deal with people, I can. Just take your time and ask for help with learning how to talk to people. :) I hope this helps and I am sending you lots of love!"
"My favorite therapist of all time ends up being a few years younger than me. It was difficult at times (especially since I have my masters in social work so I had a lot of the same credentials as her) because she had her life together am I was a big pile of shit, but she ended up being one of the people that helped me the most. I think part of it was because we were able to have a better therapist-client relationship with a closer age (she was my DBT and then also exposure therapy therapist). It’ll be uncomfortable but try to give it a shot, it may be worth it! "
"Thank you. 

I’ve reached this conclusion many times before... and I wish it made me feel better (although you reaffirming it doesn’t make me feel like I’m unjust in thinking so, so thank you!!!!) 

It just sucks because I feel like I’m at the point where I’m continuing to evolve and mature emotionally while they’re stuck at their “end point”. Sometimes I feel like I have to learn how to parent myself, and then use those things I learn to justify/make sense of their actions. 

Thank you SO much!! Seriously, this community has been so comforting!!! "
"The only thing that can really help them right now is to be admitted into a psych ward. But it's hard to get someone forced into there unless they are a danger to themselves or others. All you can try to do right now is just make sure they are safe, and maybe try to convince them to get help. 
I've been there, and no matter how many times someone told me i wasn't okay, i didn't believe them. It took my doing something incredible stupid that got the police involved, then finally sent to the hospital. 
you are a great friend for caring so much, I wish you well. ♥ "
"Well, considering it is clearly causing you a great deal of distress, and this compulsion is potentially dangerous for yourself and those around you, it's good you're going to see someone. It's no doubt difficult, but imagine feeling better? It's a very specific compulsion, there are surely people who can help with that. You could feel better, you won't put anyone at risk. There really are a bunch of good things that can come from you getting a little help. Be honest with your therapist, and yourself, it's the best thing you can do.

I really wish you the best man"
"While every grieving process is personal, not all grieving is equally healthy. And sometimes behavior isn't actual grieving but avoiding of such -- numbing the pain rather than facing it. 

What are the classical ways people avoid pain? Intoxication, euphoria (such as through sex) and lashing out at others. 

Don't feel guilty. You are trying to stick with someone through a difficult time, and that's commendable. But if this continues you may want to talk to him about how he's dealing with things.

As for the title: the best way to do that is mindfulness practice."
"i know exactly how that feels. been with my other half ten years, and over that time i have lost contact with all close friends, found out they werent actually close after all.

its only now though when im starting to struggle a bit within myself that im starting to realize i have no 'real' mates.

its tough, but you just need to get yourself out there and try meeting new people - join a club... im taking my own advice, and hoping it works

dont let it get you down, keep on trucking and youll be fine... and, there is always reddit if you need someone to chat to..."
"Don't shut yourself in and be introverted. This time of your life can make a huge difference to the future. Formative years have a huge influence on who you are, but now you start making the decisions. Don't be afraid of mmaking mistakes, but don't be led by passion alone. Go to nature, if you can make regular trips to somewhere outside the city, I'd recommend it. Go camping, even do it alone (but don't just 'be' alone). Things will change, I can understand your sense of injustice, but you won't get any closure on that, you might find the anger comes out somewhere else, don't fight it, understand it. I'd recommend building boundaries and creating independence from your mother as she undoubtedly has had been part of this and it will always resonate as long as you have a similar relationship with her. 
It can change."
"I'm no doctor, but you may be having a manic episode. This is very serious, go see a doctor ASAP for you are going to have a VERY bad time when you crash. In people with bipolar disorder going from mania all the way down to depression is terrible, the depression can last anyway from 2 weeks to a few months. Believe me you don't want this. 

Please seek help, I know the high it is so great you feel powerful and more alive but it is like any drug it gives a temporary lift, then it drops you.

Edit: didn't read the whole post, so you have ""come down."" Well as I said before, see a doctor you may be on the verge of a depressive episode. I would mention bipolar to your pcp, see if you can get a referral to a psychiatrist. With the right medication your depression can can be reduced in length. But again, I'm not a doctor."
"Talk about all this stuff in a session.   The sessions are about you and not her, so take a session to get to the root of why she’s making you feel uncomfortable.

You’ll probably delve into some issues and come out with a few breakthroughs about your self perception and acceptance.

There’s good therapists and bad therapists, but just keep in mind they are there as a treatment/service you are paying for.  Her training is to guide you through your stuff.  If she as a human happens to bring up some of your issues, dig into it some.

The whole session is not about her, or her success, or what she looks like.  She’s there to guide your own mind into realizing things through conversation.  Bring things up.  Bring it all up. 

Ps: you can always just find a new therapist, if she’s simply a distraction for you."
"Why are you afraid to tell your family what's wrong? Did someone in your family do something to you and you talking about it will cause a major controversy? If so, it's not your fault, the controversy started the sec that person did something to you....If i'm off base and you're simply scared to open up....Then don't be. It's that simple. You're young, so your family is most likely more than willing to listen to you no matter how uncomfortable it may be to hear. Don't hold on to this anxiety and depression because as you get older it will turn up at the most inopportune time and you'll regret not speaking up sooner. Get help now...Don't wait. The faster you act, the faster you heal.

"Maybe it would be a good idea to at least consult with a therapist? And see what they think the best plan of action would be. 

I’m not a therapist, but I am a special education teacher, and if I saw what your son was doing - and that he calmed down when he saw you - I would guess that what we call the “function of the behavior” is to see you. He might know that if he acts up enough, mom will be called, she’ll come, and he’ll get attention. Again, this is just speculation, but I would worry that a therapist who was available/gave him attention immediately after the behavior would be a similar “reward” if he became attached to that person. Usually it’s better to provide skills for the child to use before/in the early stages of engaging in the behavior. 

A consultation with someone who can actually meet and evaluate your son, as opposed to me, a random stranger on the internet, could help give you some insight into why he is doing this and therefore what would be most helpful - virtual therapy, in person therapy, something else altogether, who knows. "
"We all feel some sort of weirdness in us. I have social issues as well, but I dont let it control my life. I still go out, I still talk to people, I try. And maybe that's the only thing you can do, you know -- try.

And it's okay to be awkward in social settings. Maybe you just worry too much you'll screw things up? And that's normal. Im not very good with romantic relationships myself but I still believe (no matter how cheesy it sounds) that there's someone out there who is meant for you. And youre limiting the possibilities by putting a deadline. Love should not be forced. It comes at the right time.

I honestly dont have an answer for the cold showers. But hey if it makes you feel a bit better, do it. Anything that relieves you from negativity is a step away from it. :)

I used to also think I put baggage on my friends when I tell them my problems. Now i dont anymore. Because when i think about it, if i put myself in their shoes, i wouldnt want to be in the dark when i know i could help a friend feel better. Tell your bestfriend what you feel. It will help a lot!"
"It's good that you have a good level of insight and know that these fears come from paranoia.  I'm  guessing one way might be to work on improving your anxiety management skills as paranoia and anxiety can be on a similar continuum.  Mindfulness is really popular at the moment and some of the techniques around mindful medidation and learning to observe your thoughts and label feelings letting them come and go could be helpful.  Headspace (a paid app after 10 free online sessions) is very good for this.  

Also CBT techniques like keeping thought records could help.  It's what I use a lot for my own paranoia (as mine comes from anxiety and trauma rather than psychosis).  The idea is you write down what's happening (just the bare facts), what you're feeling and then what you're thinking. You rate what you're feeling by how intensely you feel it (so out of 10 where 10 is the most intense). 

You then try and identify the most prominent of these thoughts (the hot thought) and write down any evidence you can think of that supports that thought being true and then everything you can think of that doesn't support it.  You then go back through your feelings and rate them again.  The hope is that by carrying out this kind of evaluation you can bring down the intensity of the feelings so you can feel a bit more grounded in reality. You can print blank forms [here](http://www.essentiallifeskills.org/resources/ThoughtRecord%20%282%29.pdf) - it's my own website so apologies for the font.

"Hi, are you able to schedule an appointment with a doctor? It doesn’t have to be a therapist. My gynecologist is actually the one who prescribes my anti d’s. Just someone you trust. For now, I know it sounds dumb but remember to breathe and focus on your breathing. What are some things that are bothering you? "
"Hmmm...I think you might miss the stimulation of that--mental stimulation, that is. You miss it, but then again, you are kind of glad it is over. I miss my time at high school because I miss just being young and free, no responibilities like I have now. Hearing our class song (Come Sail Away) does that for me too."
"How do you not understand?

I’m glad you stopped drinking and don’t use drugs but I’m sorry to hear you self harm and that the voices are telling you to And your lack of sleep. That breaks my heart to hear. I hope you find a way to be able to maintain it all! No one deserves to suffer like that �� you’ll be in my prayers though!
Pain is something I am familiar with. But pain has also given us perspective so we can be grateful for that. It sounds like you’re doing everything that you can! I hope you’re proud of all you’ve endured and are enduring. The love you’re willing and able to give after and while enduring pain is admirable.
"This is the most significant difference that doctors need to diagnosed and its the two extremes one is really high energy, sleeping less than 8 hrs and the other is low energy, sleeping more than 8.

But you can still have both"
"Yeh it looks like it. The instructions on the Sertraline are for 5 days 100mg then 5 days 50mg to taper off and there's only 15 Fluoxetine. They're capsules so I can't break them unfortunately. I'll try skipping a day and if I feel off I'll call in to reception and see what they say.

Thanks for the advice people."
"Yes this. It isn't unusual for someone 20 years old to not know where they are going yet. Heck, when I was 20, I had flunked out of college and had NO idea what to do. I agree with the others that if you feel uncomfortable going forward that you should let her know. Good luck and I hope you find your path soon. :)"
"Don't look back, you know what the past problems were.  Now you can go about fixing them.  First, tell yourself no one gives a shit about you. You have to care for yourself.  Don't relie on anyone nut but yourself until you know you can relie on someone.  Shop around for a therapist, interview 10, 20, until you find someone you trust.  You know how how to spot a narcissist right?

Be proud that you have the ability to read peoples subtle and maybe not so subtle body language.  there may be times when this becomes exaggerated if you overthink it. That is the right time to just let things go and turn the situation around by verbally protecting yourself. Leave the room if you have to.  There are some great books available where you can do some great verbal Jedi mind tricks on people.  "
"I'm so sorry you're hurting. It breaks my heart that you're thinking of taking your life. I think you should talk to your psychiatrist about how your feeling, I dont think trazodone is the medicine for you. Trazodone is also used as a sleeping medication with day time drowsiness so that may explain the not caring and feeling boring. I would also see a counselor if you arent already. Please talk to them about all of this. I have terrible anxiety about my health and sometimes it's so bad I actually feel sick physically. Anxiety is powerful. Please reach out to them. "
"If you're in the US, you can ask any therapist if they'll work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based. Most will! Many places have free clinics where you can get sessions at no charge. Also check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She has a ton of resources and a very supportive community. Lots on depression, anxiety, things that help, finding the right therapist, etc. She also answers as many questions as she can in the comments in the first hour after her vids go up on Mondays and Thursdays. She also does livestreams. Hope this helps!"
"Sweetheart, you don't have to keep this psychiatrist. Ask for a different one, you have to be the one advocates for your well being. Trust me, I know how hard it is. I'm still healing from my own issues. You can do this, you deserve to have confidence in your treatment plan. If you don't, then they are setting you up for failure. You deserve better than that. I'm glad you have someone advocating for you, but I'm telling ya don't take no for an answer. You're in charge of your mental health. I hope this helps, and if you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. "
"I don't know how many times I have reached out to professionals only to be told ""come on, it's not so bad... you have it good compared to others... bingo bingo bingo etc"" because I was still some what able to function. Nobody took my pleas for help seriously until I was at my limit and attempted suicide. Suddenly I was able to access a therapist and psychiatrist right away after being discharged from the hospital instead of being on a wait list of 1-2 years.

People are all about 'raising awareness' but what's the point if no one is going to invest in services needed to help the people with mental illnesses? If there are no resources available to those seeking help whats the point of them being aware of needing help?

Instead we keep cutting funding, but increase funding for 'awareness campaigns' it's so backwards! "
"Hey - chiming in here, I don't have an answer for you but this has happened to me too. Briefly in 2004, then I was fine until 2014, then it just died completely. It comes back fleetingly sometimes but I still struggle with it every day. I've historically associated it with diagnosed depression though, which I am on medication for.  But at a support group speaking with other depressives no one in the room had experienced what I was describing. They had issues turning off the racing negative thoughts. So I don't know how many replies you are going to get... I definitely feel pretty alone with this. I feel like my inner monologue was me. It was my personality and it's just gone. I have learned to cope though, writing down lists and journalling helps bring out a bit of an inner voice but it really takes conscious effort to think about stuff. I don't feel very strong feelings about anything anymore other than physical discomforts like hot and cold, or a sense I disagree with something someone is saying at a factual level.. I don't draw or make music anymore. I just exist."
"Hi, I'm OCD, anxiety, and  depression as well, and on prozac for several months (high dose for OCD). 

I also like being alone, while I tend to not shy away from social interaction as much as you say you do, I have always valued time by myself, just to relax, even if I'm procrastinating. That being said I do value being around people from time to time just not for very long.

The introspective nature of depression and anxiety I think naturally makes you withdraw from other social. I have also noticed that with my medication while is dampens my anxiety and depression significantly, the behaviors and thought patterns I have got into when my condition was at its height have not changed, which is why I am still going to therapy. 

I just looked up the side effects for zoloft, among which is sleepiness, tiredness, and drowsy feeling, which might fuel your desire to withdraw as well. 

The fact that you are thinking about means something, and I encourage that you consult a professional and talk to people within your support network if it concerns you.

I wish you the best!"
"Is it impossible though that you both sit down and figure something out, without anger and argument? You are in the same team after all, right? Mental illness is such a relationship killer. It is killing your relationship whenever you try to win the argument and make the other do this and not do that. Just be aware of that. It doesn’t matter who’s right and who’s wrong, it will work against you anyway. To make things work, you have to *listen* to each other. But mental health issues make this very hard. I’d not be too happy either if my gf throws me out of the house. But in your case, I truly believe that would help the relationship. Healthy relationships are based on sharing, giving. Unhealthy relationships are based on a lacking, fulfillment of a need: needing to feel loved. If you both truly care about the relationship, you accept the pain of distance and be serious about personal health first, then make the time when you meet really worth it, in my opinion

(And don’t be too hard on each other - you’d probably be one in a million if you stop fighting)"
"When my anxiety is high I ALWAYS have trouble sleeping so I think it's fairly normal. I really feel for her :( I know what its like when you're soooo tired and you just can't rest even though you want to. 

One thing that usually helps me is my husband either giving me a massage or wrestling with me and pinning me down (depending on which one I prefer that day - sometimes I just need to relax and sometimes I need to expel some nervous energy). 

Meditation, mindfulness, and guided relaxation exercises can also be good for some people when they have trouble sleeping, though they have never helped me personally. You can find guided meditations or guided relaxation on youtube, and mindfulness exercises can be found by googling (or there are probably some on youtube too but audio is not necessary for those like it is for the other two). 

Another thing that really helps me is just to talk or write down everything that I'm worried about, and then reach a decision about what I'm going to do about it (even if it's just ""I will wait and see what happens""). Once I've reached a decision I just stick to it and that usually helps me to think about it a little less and calm down a bit. Externalising the problems by talking/writing also helps because it helps to put them in perspective and sometimes just getting them out of my head is enough. 

And this has never worked for me either, but I've heard some people say that if they do more exercise and other activities during the day then they're more tired at night and sleeping through the night is easier. 

I hope some of that is helpful - a lot of it will be trial and error and sometimes it won't work as well as you'd like, but something in there should hopefully make at least a small difference. Wherever she's receiving treatment will probably have some good suggestions for her too. "
Do you get to appreciate the experience in any positive way?
Good suggestion. Any money is better than no money for them.
Happy birthday to you. I will send lots of hugs your way. :)
How is that related to mental health? You need more context.
I have never related to a post more. You’re not alone OP.
I just looked this up and am both fascinated and confused...
I never even know if what I'm thinking is what I truly think
I pretty sure they're talking about binge/purge cycle ��
I’m fucking sick of it. It’s the worst kind of Catch 22
Not a huge fan of it. I wish they had some rotating images.
Thank you everyone this will really help me moving forward.
Thanks a lot for the material. I really appreciate the help!
That picture does not fit the message lol. Looks very weird.
"The answer is you leave him, because he is abusive as hell. "
"There you go, insulting people with an illness again.  Stop."
Totally readable! Did you publish the whole thing anywhere?
Yah idk I just wanted to post this to just vent I guess lol
"Yes, i guess i can look in the library and ask my therapist."
"Yes, starting CBT tomorrow and am taking 80mg prozac for OCD"
You sound more like RAD to me. Even just the way you write.
You think I'm cute? (blushes) OMG....can I get your number?!
fell free to send pm. You can talk about everything with me.
i've become an introvert as ive gotten older...and lazier :)
what makes you think others will be better off without you?
"Cymbalta -&gt; generics 60 mg
And klonopin .5 for anxiety

I feel the same and just wanted to give you a high five bc I relate. I didn’t want to shower or eat or move before; now i look forward to getting my daily coffee to get out of the house.
Cheers to you for living your best life and trying every. damn. day."
"Deleted and edited my whole comment: checked your posting history. You’ve been reported. Troll. Stop with the fake posting. There’s mods on other post calling you out for how much you do this.

School shootings aren’t something to benefit from even if it’s a silly upvote and some attention on social media. "
"Don't get me wrong there are still bad moments every now and then but you learn how to get deal with them better and better, they will always be there but you're able to carry on quicker and easier, I do feel proud, I feel more grown up like I have a place in this world now, no matter how small I have a place here!"
"I didn’t like it. I’m not sure if I just wasn’t in the right headspace for it, but I usually left sessions feeling pretty frustrated. 

I saw a therapist a year or so later and explained how I felt about it, and she suggested that she didn’t rate it either, particularly for people who were more self aware. "
"I have a lot to say about this, but I don't want to say anything until I've asked you some questions. I'm bipolar 1 myself, so I have a little bit of experience with this. Do you think that the person you are without the medication is really who you are? Or are you saying that maybe it's supposed to be who you are?"
"I have to say yes you are very depressed, you dont need everything to be depressed but at least 5 and suicidal ideation is the last and most crucial one. I have to tell you yes take them plus anti-depressant are just inhibit serotonin and boost gaba. NO this will not cause any liver or kidney problems so take them."
"It’s probably just me, english isn’t my native language either. But like, how to deal with what? The abusers? The symptoms? The cult situation? And why the question about self abuse? I don’t understand what you need. Information? Advice? People who can relate? I’m lost. It’s probably just me being stupid "
"Thank you. I'm trying hard to do my best... one of the things I am dealing with is drugs, but I can't find an Narcotics Anonymous that isn't centered around the belief of a higher power (which I have never had nor will ever get). So its hard to find support... Always trying though and thank you again for saying hi!"
"Well that wasn't stressful to read at all. Awesome.

Why do I need a diagnosis though? ADHD requires medication. Anxiety disorders require medication. Autism does not.

I'm 19. I have time even if I wanted to.

Do you think I should see someone from what I described above? Do you think I should listen to my friend?"
"Wrapping up a course of prednisone myself.  I had never heard the term ""prednisone rage"" before, but I can confirm it's a thing that exists.  And since I also need to breathe, I'm just gonna hold back on the caffeine and try to ride the rocket-bus to the end of the line.  And hopefully get some sleep in a few days."
"&gt;i didnt say anything.

Did you not say anything because you enjoyed it? Because you were scared? Or just because you didn't know how to feel about what was happening? 

I suspect latter, it's crucial that you think seriously about sex. What kind of things you enjoy/don't enjoy.

With the talk of grey area, I suspect you didn't have many (any?) enjoyable sexual experiences, if that's true, you need to figure out why that is. 

You're a human being, not a sex doll, you need to be able to enjoy yourself during sex, not to contemplate ""WHAT WAS THAT"" for days after."
"Death is a huge part of our existence. It has a big impact on everyone around us even if we'd like to tell ourselves that it wouldn't. It's something that everyone has to face at some point in their life and it's perfectly normal to think about it. 

However if you do suddenly feel you actually want to do this and that you may act on these thoughts please speak to someone. I have experienced both of these scenarios and one doesn’t always necessarily lead to the other. I myself think about what it would be like to die. I don’t actually want to die anymore though."
"It's important to see more therapists until you find the best fit. See at least 5 and choose the best. You should feel comfortable from the beginning. Yes, age is an issue, because you want someone with experience specifically relating to the challenges you seek. Be careful not to tell yourself lies like ""I'm a loser."" You should rebuke the voice telling you that. You probably wouldn't tell others that and shouldn't tell yourself that, nor should anyone else tell you that. The right therapist will help you replace that thought with one that is more healthy and accurate. By the way, you might look into life coaches with experience in cognitive therapy, because they tend to be more solution oriented rather than psychologists, which are more diagnosis and analysis oriented, or psychiatrists which are more drug-oriented."
"Just a week really won't do it. You often have to wait at least 2 weeks to feel anything and probably a month to even start to feel better.

I've been on antidepressants for a while, so I can't remember exactly what it was like when they started to work. 

The first go round was undergrad. I think I just suddenly noticed that I wasn't getting as angry, as fast, or as long. It wasn't like it started working suddenly, it was more like I just wasn't paying attention and suddenly something brought my attention to it. I stopped taking it after undergrad because I didn't feel like finding another prescriber when I had to be discharged from the campus counseling center.

This second round my depression was a bit more severe. I started Effexor maybe 4-5 years ago? I think I just didn't feel as sad and weepy. But it didn't take all the symptoms away and I was still pretty sad. My psychiatrist increased the Effexor and added on a few different meds to balance me out. I think I'm in a good place now. I'm not as volatile or sad, and I don't constantly think about killing myself. "
"Been there. Throw yourself 100% into your job. If you were a good employee, now you’re going to be an outstanding one. Is your home not a reflection of yourself? Time to start painting, organizing, finding storage solutions, etc. 
Is your car filthy? Spend a week getting that sorted out. 
Literally distract yourself every chance you get and spend that time on everything that can help you in the long run, (career, peaceful home environment, clean car, etc.) 
That helped me a ton. It will hurt a lot, but push through it. You can do it and you will. Embrace the freedom you have and learn new ways to love yourself. 
Go to the salon, a spa, do your nails, change your wardrobe, etc. 
The focus should be on yourself now. 
Your mental health, spiritual growth, physical health, grooming, etc. 
Write a list of where you want to be and work hard everyday to get there. 
Do you want to be happy? 
What makes you happy? 
What activity is worth giving your time to? Your life; the time you have to give is absolutely VALUABLE and since it is so, decide what is worth it. 
For me it’s my family and my loved ones (friends). 
Do not waste your time chasing something because it “will make me feel good” like an immediate relationship or material things. Focus on your growth. 
Wishing you lots of strength and peace and happiness ��"
"Please don't beat yourself up too much. I have autism, BPD, and PTSD, it really is terribly hard. It is pretty clear to me that this is not properly in your control. You describe pulling down your pants and literally hacking at yourself. That is pretty clearly not properly in your control, I imagine your boyfriend, who you describe as sweet and gentle, understands that. Indeed its likely most people do, there are some pricks out there, but most people are reasonably understanding. It simply makes people feel bad to see it, a lot of them figure that by acting as though you have agency it will help, it doesn't in many cases, but it makes sense they may think it would. 

They likely know at heart its not really in your control, but if they assume you have more control it gives them hope it will get better, assuming it is a pure compulsion causes fear and people to give up more. As you describe it things have improved. I only hope you can look at all the good you are doing and improvements you are making. This is a lapse, they are hard and sad, but they do happen. Cliched as it sounds recovery really isn't a straight well paved road. It is a winding path, it times even going backwards, but it does bring one forward over time. I really hope so much that things just get better and easier, and that your day can be beautiful. "
"&gt;**The Rational conscious part of me literally surrenders as soon as its clouded by emotions, such as anger.**

Karzelov, that is true for all of us.  The human condition is that, whenever  we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window  because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other  peoples' intentions and motivations.

This is why, whenever we are very angry,  we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool  down.  We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are  experiencing intense feelings.

As **Regalshield** observes, most major cities offer excellent  treatment programs (e.g., DBT, CBT, and TFP) that can teach you the  emotional skills needed to better regulate your own emotions.  They  can teach you how to do self soothing;  how to  intellectually challenge  intense feelings instead of  accepting them as  ""facts""; and how to trust  others.

They  also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in  the  room  instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's  personality  is essentially unchanged day to day);  and how to avoid  black-white  thinking by learning to tolerate strong  mixed feelings,  uncertainties,  ambiguities, and the other gray areas of  interpersonal  relationships.

I therefore suggest you see a psychologist to find out what you're dealing with.  He/she will refer you to a good treatment program in your area that can teach you the missing skills."
"&gt; My last therapist hypothesized that I ""developed"" BPD after a traumatic experience at age 16  

That is one problem with CPTSD, the term is decades old but it is still not adopted into the [""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) by the American Psychiatric Association.  

That means it is not that recognized since it is not included in their ""Bible"".  
So the vast majority of mental health professionals have proper knowledge about this personality disorder.  

But it has been recognized by the [""World Health Organization""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) and is included in their [""Diagnostic Manual""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-11), so it is not something made up by crazy people :)  

There is also /r/cptsd  

From personal experience i can only tell you that i like to read a lot and had to read up on certain mental disorders for work related stuff.  

I also know that i my head is not quite right since i can remember, although i never tried to self diagnose me.  

About 2 or 3 years ago i found out about CPTSD and that was the first time in 30 years that i all my weird problems clicked together and made sense.  

And yes, i am in treatment, although only for anxiety and depression.  
I miss one of the ""important"" diagnostic criteria for CPTSD although they are still not certain what really is wrong in my head.  

But in the end, it does not matter.  
The only thing that is important to me is that i refuse to do exposure therapy for certain things.  
I can deal with a whole lot of anxiety and mange pretty good on my own.  

But that never worked with certain things, they only got worse and i blamed myself.  
What helped me was to read that exposure therapy with CPTSD is a very bad treatment option and that helped me a whole lot.  
"
"I agree with darkstar as well. I just had my first CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) therapist today and he told me about how CBT is a program, and it works towards your thinking.

I am diagnosed with OCD and anxiety, and earlier this summer I was a complete wreck. I went to a therapist for talk and they helped me calm down, but did not help me change my way of thinking. Talk therapy for some people can just be paying a professional to vent to, and I can see how this might make you think that they are manipulating you into coming back again and again, even if that is not their true intention.

CBT however, is different. My dad went through CBT for his own depression when he was in college and he described it as a learning experience, with therapy sessions as a ""class"" and the time in between spent applying what you have learned. You may like CBT as it leaves you with a level of accountability.

The first step to recovery is recognizing your problem, but you can only move forward from there by being willing to change that problem by whatever means necessary.

From your post, I understand why you may think the way you do, I sometimes have thought this way too. However, a good therapist will focus on your recovery, with the payment being a objective necessity because s/he has to eat and pay the bills too. My therapist over the summer was very understanding if I could not pay him on a specified day, and I would often pay for 2-3 sessions whenever I visited him. Most therapists are there to help you, they would not have joined their profession if that was not their primary motivation. I have resisted advice from my therapists because I am a procrastinator and do not want to face the pain, but the saying **""It'll get worse before it gets better""** perfectly describes the recovery of mental health.

 Good luck on your journey!"
Agreed. Please get checked out to make sure nothing is wrong
Can you give more context? Because I might be able to relate.
Can you provide some more details on what’s making it hard?
Do you cry because it’s hard or because for another reason?
Exactly!!! I struggle so much I get up cause I’m scared tbh
Explain. To clarify I am only referring to my individual case
"Hey man saw you created a sub for me! :P Good job, I’m in. "
I love you. It goes on. It won’t change. It still goes on.
I'd recommend reporting him to both the sub and reddit mods.
"I'm definitely codependent, my needs have always come first. "
"I'm not a doctor, but ringing in the ears surely is tinnitus?"
I’ll add Trauma and Recovery by Judith Herman to this list.
I’m in Canada and I’ve been on a waitlist since February.
Jumping into bed after a shower is one of the best feelings!
"Man for someone on a mental health sub, you have no sympathy."
"Of course, whatever you are comfortable with :)

&amp;#x200B;"
"Okay, hold on here... why are you in the same room with her? "
People care. Lots and lots of people care. Please believe me.
Sounds exactly like depression. You should consult a doctor.
"Thank you, I needed this. I appreciate the help and support! "
Thanks! Just got to take it one day at a time until it passes
"That was the weakest comeback I've ever witnessed, congrats. "
"That's good, well good luck, I hope you figure things out :) "
That's the truth. Once they figure it out they will be happy
"Understood, thank you for taking time to answer the question!"
"What do you think about that causes you to cry?

&amp;#x200B;"
"Yeah, please do. Maybe we can figure some shit out together? "
Yes! Guided meditation in therapy was a turning point for me
"Yes,  thoughts and feelings are transient. They come and go. "
You're welcome! Knowing more about your OCD is always helpful
can massage therapists tell when you've gone through trauma?
"you'll make it, but it starts with you making the first move."
"I didn't expect a response on this so quickly; nonetheless, thank you for the reply. I understand that it's normal for people to be scared of the unknown, especially an unknown they will never actually experience, but the amount of terror I feel is horrible. I feel like I'm going to die when I'm looking at the sky. "
"I totally relate. I am really sick of seeing all these friendships. I been trying to make friends my whole life and it's really gotten me nowhere but depression and total hate for the public.
I am sure no one cares anything I say anymore either, don't know why I'm posting this. Guess because so you don't feel alone."
I used to do this but instead of being phrases my brain would split up long words into syllables and then repeat each syllable three times before moving onto the next one. I was later diagnosed with OCD and I have always wondered about this but as it didn't cause me distress I think maybe it was just my idle mind...
No shame in that. Weed is no different than whatever you have to take in pill form. Weeds probably better for you anyway. Maybe eating it can help. Once processed through your liver it produces a high 10x as powerful as smoking. That's what Joe Rogan says anyway lol. And I believe it. Eat too much and you're wasted
"Your therapist sounds like a robot. It’s important to have a good rapport with your therapist. It’s important they have good skills as well. It doesn’t sound like your therapist is very skilled and they sound very cold and ineffective. Therapy is about you. If it’s not working for you, get another therapist "

thanks. i hope u can get the therapy u need too. i think some of these feminist therapists see trans men as the result of internalized misogyny rather than accepting gender identity disorder as a real thing even tho its in the dsm. idk if you identify as male or female but i think most liberal therapists wont help u
"the only other thing i took was ondansetron (zofran) for the nausea, which does interact with each other. however, i took that AFTER i was experiencing everything so i don’t think that had much to do with it. i think my body just didn’t react well, and the rapid heart rate was probably from my anxiety in general"
"Sadness is a normal part of human existence, even sadness for reasons we don't understand. Being sad for a few hours then happy for a few hours is usually just normal mood fluctuation as well. Of course, I can't diagnose you as I'm not a doctor, and even a doctor likely couldn't diagnose you without more information, but I am someone who's lived with bipolar disorder for most of my life. I can tell you that in my experience, what you're describing doesn't sound like bipolar disorder. 

Best advice I can give is to say that if it's causing you distress, see a doctor. "
"The sad reality is that there's not much you can do about going bald. Yeah you can get a transplant if you do end up losing your hair. But it's going to be pretty expensive.

Look I went bald when I was 23. Not just a little bald but horseshoe pattern bald. Because of it, I keep my head shaved. And I've grown out a little bit of facial hair as well.

You can still live a good life without a full head of hair. Don't worry and stress about going bald too much. Otherwise you'll always be miserable. There are plenty of people who are bald. So keep that in mind for later."
"Very interesting that you live in South Asia. Despite living in the U.S. I work for a Japanese company. I am very in tune with their work methods. I can say without a doubt, it is unhealthy. It’s no coincidence they literally ha e a term for death by over work. 

That absolutely solidifies for me the notion that you must take care of yourself and disregard the standards set before you when they become too much. 

Keep up the good work though, sounds like you’re succeeding despite the obstacles you face. That tells me you’re stronger than you think! ����"
"“Hears voices”. I’m no psych but that sounds like schizophrenia. Hospital can’t diagnose her? Definitely a crappy hospital. Psych’s can’t diagnose her? Sounds like crappy psychs or her story keeps changing. A decent psych would at least make a guess and try her on something, see how it goes, then reevaluate and readjust. You can’t scan a brain for a chemical imbalance (yet), so meds are recommended based off what worked for other people with similar symptoms and our current understanding of brain chemistry and how it relates to the presenting symptoms. "
"So I get that your roommates are assholes, but why does your boyfriend’s diagnosis justify him lashing out at others? No diagnosis justifies that kind of behavior, and you shouldn’t use his mental illness in that manner. 

As a therapist, your roommates aren’t responsible for any dangerous behavior of your boyfriend’s if they’re mean to him. People are mean to other people. It’s not their job to morph to what you want. It’s your job to learn to adapt and overcome to these types of people.  

Also, some of the behavior from your roommates that you’ve described isn’t ableist behavior: it’s just shitty roommate behavior. Especially the whole “playing music loudly” thing. My roommates did the same thing. Honestly that’s part of the experience, and having roommates teaches you to learn appropriate and healthy conflict resolution. Have a conversation with them. Tell them how you feel. Look for compromises. My roommate used to blast porn on his laptop all night. I worked on it with him, and learned how to resolve issues through the whole experience. "
"Yes I have the same thing and am also 19F. I agree with the above poster and suggest you seek help from a professional as I plan to do the same.

Did something happen to you as a kid? Or are you insecure about your appearance? 

Because for me I grew up being bullied over my smile. once I started being harassed and told to smile as a joke, it made me never wanna open my mouth again. 
People would shove cameras in my face in middle school and talk about me in the halls. I was constantly called ugly and hearing it so much made me start to believe it. 

As a result I get really really anxious whenever someone takes photos of me or tells me to “smile!” since it reminds me of being teased. Which makes me look uncomfortable in the photo thus reinforcing my insecurities. 

I really think you should work on getting it solved so it doesn’t affect you later in life. We live in the digital age so people love to take photos. It would suck to look back and see that you either have no photos due to your fear or that you look awkward in the ones people managed to sneak and get."
"It sounds like there’s so much going on and it must feel absolutely horrible.

I think it’s really understandable that anybody in those circumstances would feel depressed. And overwhelmed by emotion, I can see how that might lead to self harming, it’s a really difficult time.

Important thing is to find a supportive adult, that can be a teacher, a school nurse or a parent, it doesn’t really matter. Someone you can trust , and that you. can talk to about what’s going on in your life. You won’t get in trouble, it will help you, and people at school or the nurse at least will definitely listen to you and take your experience seriously.

I think your mum says that it’s just a phase because everybody does go through a really difficult stage in their teens, so people might think of  it as part of “the teenage angst”. But self harming and suicidal thinking can be really dangerous and demands to be taken seriously. There is no shame in asking for someone who is able to help, when you’re  overwhelmed and lonely.

I used to self harm too, and I grew up with a mum that would be really nasty and horrible to me, I hated being at home. But then, like the other commenter said, when I left home I was able to start a new life and do all the things that I love and meet amazing people who just “get it” kind of, you know? And a lot of people see the wonderful qualities and strengths in you. You get to travel, get a dog, a boyfriend/girlfriend. There’s so much more to your life than what is going on right now. Maybe right now you can’t change things, but that doesn’t mean that you never will. A life that you want to have just hasn’t started yet.

Maybe try to find a hobby that you enjoy doing, something that you’re genuinely excited about? Could be drawing, reading, swimming, baking, crafts, music, anything really. Anything that you find interesting will help you feel more fulfilled in life, and will help you get through tough times. Spending time outdoors, even just walking someone else’s dog for example, can bring a moment of calm into an over-loaded brain.

I hope any of this is helpful, I’m sorry I wrote a lot! I just could empathise or at least sympathise with what you’re going through. You are very strong, you’ve been somehow dealing with this for 2 years already, on your own - that’s incredible. You are also very resourceful seeking sources of support, otherwise you wouldn’t have written here. You are good enough just as you are, and you a worthy. There are people out there that really care about others suffering and want to help how they can."

Get a lawyer and talk to your psych. I hear you have to apply and get denied in order to get a lawyer who will take the case for free then you pay then when you get approved. Its possinle. My psych said a long paper trail of proof you have tried many meds for many years helps. My sister got it. Shes not even on meds.
"I doubt it as e.g. sick pay may be higher, they may have a duty to ease you back in, responsibilities to you under the Equality Act. It's difficult to get long term benefits for mental illness, you'll end up on JSA and job hunting. Not ideal when depressed. But go to the CAB and discover your rights before you quit. "
"I had a PSYCHIATRIST tell me ""You don't look depressed."" No shit motherfucker. I was taught that showing any sort of emotion was considered a weakness and I struggle to open up, especially to men (of which said psychiatrist was). Needless to say, I got a new psychiatrist. I'm still pissed about this, six years later."
"I know you were. That is why I edited my comment. :D

"I say be honest to yourself, say how you feel, let them be faced with it.  But when you ask how they are, and they give you the robot answer, think of it as that they are uncomfortable or afraid of speaking their own mind.  Kinda makes you feel a little bad for them instead of just assuming they are mindless zombies."
"I'm by no means qualified to make any kind of diagnosis, but the first thing that did spring to mind is schizophrenia, since that most commonly appears in men in their early 20's. Your symptoms could absolutely be due to a myriad of other things as well, but it could be something you might like to look into further. "
"It might be overwhelming but it's better to be honest. Just tell them everything that you've told us on here. Otherwise they won't be able to help you very much. I'd recommend doing this sooner rather than later so that there isn't a chance of things getting worse. If you want to get better, then you need to do this."
"Sound like you should get out of the grad scheme mate if it's not for you.

"Tell another teacher about him. That’s really unsafe and promotes self harming behavior. It’s not ok to talk about self harm like that and treating extreme emotional pain as art is kinda messed up in my opinion. People like having privacy, and you don’t have to tell people you don’t know about your self harm."
"What the hell? He can’t just “decide” to drop you out of the system without a good reason. If you’re not making much progress with your current treatment that means they need to try something different.

You need to complain about this guy and ask to see another psychiatrist, if you feel comfortable doing so."
"I have lots of periods where I am extremely depressed. It cycles every 10 years (going by my hospitalization history) and is quite severe to where I attempt suicide. Hopefully, in another 7 years it will pass me by. There are also times in-between where I get moderately depressed but those periods last only a few hours to a few days.   


Maybe you should bring this up with someone...they might be able to help with therapy or meds (I hate taking meds honestly, and the only one I take religiously is my Clonidine for anxiety because it helps me sleep). Good luck to you!"
"I’m sorry. It’s definitely the most terrifying experience and I never wish anyone have to go through it. I had many panic attacks and each and every time I felt like I was having a heart attack. The emergency department was pretty much at first my second home. I do know what does help is to breathe, slowly in and out, and keep telling yourself everything is okay and this will pass. Also, to learn what are the stressors that might cause it and to address anything that feels anxious sooner than later. Then hopefully the panic attacks should occur less. Stay strong. "
"Maybe a bit arrogant and quick to've answered lol there like that, but dopamine is too easy an answer. Yes dopamine is important and influences a lot of our everyday behavior, it's not everything.

Despite that, the lol was more about the tone of your comment than the content of your comment. It came across to me as ""just fix ur dopamine and u'll be fine"", and yes it says a lot about me that I automatically interpret your comment that way. Anyway, I guess that's why people are downvoting you, dopamine as a cure-all, and not providing any extra info/context for the OP."
"That first comment is kind of right. However, don't see it as needing to be fixed. You are who you are, problems and all. Do your best to find a way to live with them. If you start to feel a certain way, find that one thing that can alleviate some of it. 
I have started painting. The last two weeks have been anxiety from hell. Somehow painting is helping me with that. I know it's not easy, I'm by no means saying it will be easy. Its just possible. 
That haze is a scary place, I've been there. If you ever need to talk, i will do what i can to help and be good company. "
First I need to make sure you understand something very very important. You are not responsible for his happiness and you can not make him better. One of the things that my family needed to realize was that I had to want help. Now that being said there are a couple of questions that can help you determine if you need to get him help now or if you can safely wait for him to do it himself. Ask him if he has a plan to end his life. It’s important that you ask it that way because he may say no if you ask if he is suicidal because often those who are will say no when asked. It sounds like he definitely is depressed and him sleeping a lot is concerning.  Offer to go to a therapist with him even if you just sit in the waiting room. Remind him that he is important and deserves to be happy and deserves to get help. Good luck.
"That’s a really delicate subject. Even trickier since you aren’t there in person. In general, it’s usually advised not to challenge a delusion (assuming that’s really what this is) because it typically just leads to the person getting upset and angry. 

Again, not sure what options there are for help, but you could suggest she go to the authorities to “report” it and hope that they realize there is a mental health issue. You could also suggest she go to an emergency room to keep herself safe. But both of those are essentially tricking her into asking for help and and hoping for the best. 
You could also tell her that you are worried about her and think maybe she should tell a doctor about her “hypnosis.” That may be the best middle-of-the-road option. Just know that there is a good chance she won’t.

"Thanks for typing all that out for little old me :)
I'm not sure people understand this but I don't find talking about it helps. I probably build up this anticipation in my head that talking to someone will mean they can actually help and when they can't, very bad thoughts happen. So I avoid it. 
I suffer from constant voices in my head, two of them but one is much more louder and dominant. They criticise everything I do and sometimes it's so dumb I can actually laugh at them. Anything can send me into a panic attack. Usually stress related but it can be a car door slamming or my phone ringing. It's ridiculous. Stress (we think) leads to absent episodes where I don't know who or where I am and my instinct is to walk off. Usually resulting in the police getting me to hospital but never treated. So that's the normal stuff. Then it gets worse like today, caused by my council not keeping to an important appointment. It makes me hate society so much. Rather not exist anymore. 
Sometimes I hallucinate a strange figure made of smoke which I think is the voice from my head but he can't ever quite get to me. It's very weird. 
I'm not in any meds. Tried about 6 different anti depressants when it all started but they made me feel worse. 
I've done a six week course with mind, one on one. It was alright and I liked the councillor and I understood what she was explaining but on my last session I told her that it just doesn't apply to my circumstances as I'm not in control. 
I've been talking myself out of A&amp;E all day. I guess I'm walking that tightrope and trying not to fall off. "
"I’m glad to hear I’m not alone in this as well! I had actually posted some time ago about this and only got one response from someone who had anemia due to low folate/b12. For them, fixing that vitamin deficiency helped. Unfortunately for me my anemia is not from deficiency. I actually have beta thalassemia minor. It’s genetic so one of my hemoglobin chains doesn’t work right so my blood doesn’t hold on to iron as well. It’s supposed to be asymptomatic but my hemoglobin levels have been low all my life. Doctors are always surprised when they see this and are like “your hemoglobin shouldn’t be this low”. But clearly it is. It’s fucking annoying. I’ve tried folic acid and b12. It usually does help with energy for a bit but sometimes that energy gives me the ants in my chest feeling. I switched to deplin though for folic acid though which seems to not be as bad. It is a form of folic acid that goes through the brain/blood barrier more easily in some people. 

I hope that for you it might be as simple as a vitamin deficiency. But for me unfortunately it’s not. Definitely check your b12/folate levels though, or get a complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia. Alternatively, you can get b12 and folate at any grocery store so you can just see if it helps. But for b12 get the liquid/sublingual type because it is absorbed easier by your body. 

The sensation is just so uncomfortable when it does come on. It’s very annoying. Most people are like “wtf are you talking about” when I tell them. I’m glad I’m not alone. 

For now, I’m mainly working with a therapist to try to reduce the anxiety and depression and hoping that will help the sensation. I’m also taking Zoloft, Ritalin for adhd, and some hydrocortisol for low cortisol levels. These are at least helping me live my life for the moment. "

this is unbelievable. Thank you for this. I have to share this.
what type of help should i seek? a therapist? psychiatrist? who
"Honestly I think you're focusing waaaay too much on semantics/diagnostic terminology and subsequently pushing yourself farther and farther from processing emotions. If you're in CBT, great- go do that without intellectualizing too much, it's detriment considering how much time you are spending trying to help yourself "
"Honestly you may need a new therapist that challenges all you’ve done before or there’s still bits of you uncovered you may need to let out. I went through 4 therapists before finding the right one. Unfortunately, insurance is making me change again BUT finding the right therapist for you makes all the difference."
I don’t know about the Canadian healthcare system or the age constrictions. In the USA you have to be 18 for signing forms etc otherwise your parents have to sign. Unfortunately since you’re under 18 your parents probably have access to that information. Quick question why wouldn’t you want your parents to know?
"I think it's really crucial to realize that you are becoming more judgmental as you get older, because this realization is what separates thoughtless judgment from its more well-mannered cousin, cautious discernment. It's preferable to blindly cut things with a knife so long as you know that that's what you are doing."
If I were in your position I would be aggressively seeking another place to work. Use all the experience you have gained and move on. If you are essentially running the place then you have great experience. You need to do this ASAP before you get so burnt out that you don’t have the energy to look for another job.
"One of my relatives is a detective in an area (US) with a particularly high rate of suicide.  I am still in shock to learn that in many cases, finding a next of kin is, how should we say - challenging?  The job is often given to police cadets to find someone who might give a damn.  Many times, there jus isn't anybody."
"Research has found that long-distance counseling in certain forms can have the same results/efficacy as face-to-face counseling. But I don't think that holds true for text messaging, it's more for video conferencing. There's also huge boundary issues when you have the ability to text your therapist at nearly any time."
"This is normal. The doctor wants to help, the only thing he/she is trained in is giving out meds. You're not their first patient presenting the way you are, so they're comfortable with prescribing something (presumably an SSRI). You can try the therapy first, if you want. Most people need both meds and therapy though."
"Yep, I do the same thing. I'm stuck in my teenage years, even though I'm an adult. I do this because it's the things that I used to do during my teen years are what gave me a sense of comfort and control. I haven't found anything in adulthood that gives me the same feeling so I stick with these same coping mechanisms."
"Yes, deep in depression I would rationalize the choice to leave the world because there was no place for me. Not to trivialize these thoughts because they reflect a genuine struggle, but I think with time and finding an accepting social circle, you can find your chosen family. It might not be right now, but a process."
You literally have no idea what you’re talking about. The only thing I agree with you on is them having addiction/dependence although they can if your family has a history of substance abuse etc. Marijuana can be classified as either stimulant or depressant depending on strain and hallucinations are extremely rare.
"yes, it's abuse. your stepdad's fucking nuts. i'm not gonna waste time trying to diagnose what else he might have, but he's clearly narcissistic.

"""My thoughts are not facts. My thoughts are not facts. Emotions have an expiration date. My thoughts are *not* facts"". I know you said you have DBT resources already, but this is something i repeat to myself over and over again, and I take deep breaths to try and counteract all the endorphins running through me. I say to myself, "" I feel ____ (whatever the emotion is). "" and I just sit and think about it. Sometimes, in a *major* crisis, I can't get myself out of the inevitable rabbit hole. For smaller things that I used to freak out over, this helps me. ��‍♀️"
"Eerrrrrrr....  


Yikes. Can I go dig a hole and hide now? I am super-embarrassed...but grateful my story has been told.  


The behavior is worse now than ever and I found myself getting reckless and not caring if I got caught. I immediately stopped what I was doing (OHHHH that took a lot of willpower to do that) and went home. I am starting to be unable to control it as well, and I know it is because the stress is so bad in my life that I can't handle it. :(   


OK...I am going to just bury myself now. If anyone needs me, I will be the one with the bag over my head."
"I'm not a professional so I can't comment scientifically, but depression has definitely took a toll on my cognition. I react slower, my memory has gone to shit and I process things much slower than I would like to. The only thing I've found is that concentration and focus is something that I can still keep under control, unfortunately, I focus on the wrong things sometimes.

Knowing what depression does to your brain biologically, I will not be surprised if depression is proven to mess with other centers of your brain just because it affects something else close to it."
"My sister has really bad anxiety and my mom says stuff like this, not quite as intense as ""it's all your fault"" but she definitely tries to distance herself from my sister's problems. I think it's super shitty, but I think that this is common for parents who can't or won't deal with their children's illness. Just remember it's a disease. You wouldn't blame someone for having diabetes or cancer. Keep talking to your therapist, see a doctor and follow their recommendations. This can be managed. It is not your fault, but it is your responsibility to take care of yourself."
"So, I don’t know where you are, but in most of the US someone exhibiting suicidal thoughts/behavior gets put on what is called a 72 hour hold (or just called a hold) for observation. This means you must stay in patient for 3 days. Now the other part that makes this frustrating is that it's not just 3 days it's 3 BUSINESS days. So say someone got put into the hospital Thursday, they would not be released (if they are cleared to go) until Tuesday. Oh and if she is on impatient observation they most likely took her phone and other personal items.

Hope this was helpful."
"What drug are you on?

I've never really felt like that. 

Being on antidepressants for me is like . . . before, when I wasn't on the drugs, I would want to get out of bed and read a book and walk my dog in the park . . . but I wouldn't want it enough to actually do it. I would just waste away and do nothing, and the thought that I wasn't accomplishing the things I wanted to do . . . that thought would make me more depressed

Now, I wake up and I want to go downstairs and drink coffee, I look forward to getting out of the house, I just actually do the shit I want to do"
"Would you describe your desire to commit suicide or or mass killing as a desire to either not exist or have a significant effect on the lives of the people around you?

I'm curious to how you got where you are because I'm sort of in a similar situation. I had very few friends at one point and was gradually losing them all so I moved to another state and now have zero friends. I relate very much to feeling jealous of peoples happyness and friendships.

"yup! that's exactly it. it sounds like you're doing everything right. and i'm betting that he's at war with himself too, most days, about his behaviors/thought patterns. You're the angel on his shoulder, and there's a devil on the other that you have zero control over. 

ALSO: I noticed in a different comment that you said you're actually a woman. Sorry about that! i wrote father in my comment above, that's just my heteronormative side coming out :p regardless, it means a lot that he's able to witness a stable relationship between the two parental figures in his life.

"Hello! I can see you’re hurting and feeling depressed. Thank you for coming to Reddit and asking for help. That’s what we’re here for :) 

It sounds like you might want to try to find some type of a “safe space” whether it be finding a music club at school or getting into choir, etc (whatever relates best to you).. see if they have music lessons? Choir was my safe space.


If possible, find an Alateen/Alanon group. 

Al-anon.org describes Al-anon groups as “a mutual support group of peers who share their experience in applying the Al-Anon principles to problems related to the effects of a problem drinker in their lives.”

“Alateen is a peer support group for teens who are struggling with the effects of someone else’s problem drinking.”

Most importantly, see your school social worker or counselor. It would be great for you to talk to someone in person. You’re safety is most important. Don’t forget about taking care of yourself! You can do this! 



Edit: I forgot to mention they also have Nar-anon groups for narcotic users. Please keep us posted! "
"For me, I felt this way after undergrad, being in college made it so easy to meet people and see people because everyone was always around and had a slot of free time and a lot of excuses to do stuff together without a lot of other responsibilities. Then everyone graduates and moves away and gets jobs and spouses and kids and houses. Suddenly, you have to work to make and keep relationships going and make plans. Since I wasn't used to this, I figured that since it wasn't easy anymore that no one cared about me enough, because of they did have going out would be easy. I didn't want to do things with people because I didn't feel like they would like me or they were doing it because they felt bad for my or something. Now it's been 3 years and I'm learning how to put work into relationships with people that aren't professional or family related or people I live with so I can see them all the time. 

My advice for you based on what I have learned so far: set up a schedule with the friends you do have. Every (insert day of the week) you go with those people to do something you enjoy, like happy hour, DnD, or bowling, whatever. With the standing appointment, everyone is able to fit it into their schedules ahead of time.  

Isolation is nice on occasion to reset, but sucks as a way of life. Good luck building your social system. "

I have the exact same problem. My life has spiraled out of control because of it. I used to fight it and try to get things done but several months ago I got tired of trying and just gave up. Now I’m trying to do stuff again but it’s incredibly difficult. I hope you find relief from this painful state of mind soon.
I like the idea.  My therapist told me something similar when I was dealing with postnatal depression about getting your mind used to making changes to prevent yourself from always falling back into the same pit.  I was my most productive in college - a time when I had a very solid routine.  You may be on to something.
"It'd probably be best if you looked into it but from what I know you can go to therapy for that too. I'm fairly sure therapy goes for anyone needing mental help even if it's not a mental illness. I'd suggest looking into it a bunch before making any moves though

"My family are a 2 hour train ride away. I just had enough this morning and came home and I don’t wanna go back, but I have to. 
I’ve never felt so much strong emotion like this before I feel sick to eat, i get all shaky and weak. It’s absolutely awful and I’m so lost as to what to do, I just wanna stay at home "
"My life in a nutshell. Can you find a hobby that will take your mind off things? Maybe one that you can do with your child? I have 5 kids of my own, and believe me, I get restless too. I start wondering if I really am worth their time, etc. etc. and that is not a good road to go down. I hope you can find some peace. :)"
"Not Skype or Zoom specifically, but I've tried the various ""online therapy"" sites out there at one point or another (e.g., 7cups, blahtherapy, Get Help, etc.), and they were all rubbish.  Unless it's a face-to-face interaction, there's no way I can even tell that I'm not just talking to an intern in a closet somewhere."
"Oh I don’t mind answering. It’s the same kind of work I did before, albeit it’s not all that well paying but that’s totally fine by me. But I totally understand the high stress work situation, I like to seek out jobs with minimal interaction with people for that reason. It’s not easy though. Good luck to you!"
"There is no compromising with abusive and toxic people. You risk either hurting yourself or  hurting their ego. It sounds like a very toxic environment to be in, you can't change him or your mothers expectations, but you can work towards moving out so you can build your own safe space, and limit your exposure to them. "
"This is like my home experience. It seems I lived a whole different childhood from my brothers, somehow. I think some of it stems from the biological/genetic influences on your personality, which affects your psychological needs and perceptions, thus determining whether your needs are met and how you interpret events. "
"Very possibly.  One of my therapists explained it this way.  ""Anti-depressants ""squeeze"" your emotional range together.  No, the lows aren't as low but the highs aren't as high.

I know I had to back down from 100mg of Zoloft to 50mg.  At 100mg I was Mr. Potato Head.  At 50mg, I will put up with a little bit of angst. "
"Ya I totally know what you mean. The chances are literally less then being hit by lightning since I dont go to parties or even anywhere where the drug could be found. 

My experience with the edible was similar to the thoughts of a panic attack, where everything seems dangerous/wrong and nothing can change that truth. "
"\-bright lights, loud music (think party scenes? dark, multi colored lights, loud noises, lots of people ----&gt; from suicide attempt/dissociative episode/traumatic experience that happened at a dance 

\- yelling, confrontation 

\- being ignored (linked to dissociative episode where i felt as if i no longer existed)"
"not open enough = ‘fine’ and so not taken seriously.
too open = ‘attention seeking’ and not taken seriously.
feels like you can’t win either way.
i understated my depression to my GP and got ignored for years. recently i went back and i made sure to detail everything to my GP and she became condescending. :/ "
"I think you need to explain what you think ""depression"" feels like, or what you think depression is.  

Because depression is not feeling sad, depression is all the things you said you experience.  

No energy, feeling exhausted, no sex drive, not experiencing fun or positive feedback from activities, feeling numb, wanting to be alone, not being interested in other people.  

That is the definition depression, a lack of neurotransmitters in your brain that keep you going and doing things.  
Depression is when your brain no longer works properly just like you described.
"
"In my experience, taking medication for depression has helped me to feel the full range of emotions that people without depression do.  When I was deep in depression, I heard my grandfather had died and I just shrugged and finished my work day like normal.  I felt nothing about it even though I had been close to him.  That is not a normal, healthy, human reaction.   With medication, I am now able to feel the full spectrum of emotions appropriately.  I feel happiness, sadness, frustration, boredom, anger, etc.  I would say that is a major increase in my quality of life. "
"OK now I'm 100% sure that you're a troll because A) you only post on mental health subreddits which I'm starting to think is for attention and/or karma because a lot of what you post contradicts other things you post, or is just seriously messed up and B) you get really defensive whenever someone calls you out on your bullshit. Not to mention you seem like a shitty person and you say disgusting things. Oh, and for everyone else reading this, before you downvote me into oblivion you should seriously check out his post history because it backs up my points pretty solidly."
"hey man. same shit here. i dont know if im the best person to talk to to make you feel better exactly, but im here. if you want to process that to someone, im in a place where id really like to have someone to talk to just so i not thinking about my girl or my family members who recently passed away. if you want a chat or some shit let me know. and remember, no matter how many things go wrong in your life, think about how arbitrarily some of them happened, and remember that good things, in hundreds, can also happen arbitrarily. you are worth it homie. i promise you that"
"I am not a professional by any means, but I really relate to your experiences. Perhaps looking into affective disorders or personality disorders and talking to a Doctor about your exact symptoms and thoughts could really help. There is also agitated depression, which is not as common but can often present in people with bipolar disorder, anxiety/panic disorder, or PTSD, among others. I was diagnosed as bipolar after over a decade of only depression, anxiety, and adhd. Everything makes a lot more sense now and I’ve started the road to recovery with proper medication and therapy, with coping mechanisms for my specific symptoms and illnesses. A proper diagnosis can change a person’s life. Look up some affective/mood disorders (same thing), you are not alone. I wish you the best and am sorry you’re going through this. "
"Really depends on the illness and how much work you have done on yourself. I'm not worried about the genetic component because its a gamble and I have zero control over the outcome. What do you have control over is your own personal stability by going to therapy, taking your meds, seeing the right specialist. If you can't take care of yourself because of your illness then don't have kids- seems obvious but it's unfortunately not. Also if you are on meds that are not OK for pregnancy, then its better to stay on your meds. I have heard many stories of bipolar women stopping their meds against medical advice, thinking their pregnancy will be ""ruined"" by meds and ended up in terrible situations. I don't believe mental illness is a reason to not start a family. Just need to be responsible- more so than the general population "
"Hey, I hope you got some sleep last night. I’m sorry for keeping you up- I fell asleep soon after writing because I’d been exhausted after barely sleeping the whole week.

I can’t afford to take that amount of time off right now. I’m a student- and there would be way too much work for me to make up if I had to take time off to deal with this. My grades are already starting to slip, and if I were to take that amount of time off, there is no way I’d be able to catch back up. I might be dropped from my research program if my grades drop enough, and I can’t risk that. 

Rationally I know that if I can hold on for a few more days or a few more weeks, it will probably get better because I’ve dealt with these flare ups before. I’m just scared because I’ve haven’t been to the point of writing a note since the first time it got like this, and that first time I was so ready the only thing that stopped me was my then girlfriend texting with a “Hi! How are you?” so I guess that doesn’t even count as an attempt. 


Thank you so much for caring. It’s a comfort to know even an anonymous person somewhere in the world cares. Maybe that means my friends are also telling the truth when they say that they care. 
I hope you’re better now than you were in the past, too. Did hospitalization and/or therapy help?

"Lmao.. I post about extremely ""abusive"" type of BPDs which has nothing to do with the generalizing of ALL Borderlines as a whole. This is why the term ""black &amp; white thinking"" or ""splitting"" is a common hallmark of your personality. You can't think in a rational manner so of course everything must be either all good or all bad. It's also why you think I'm verbally attacking every single one of you, which I'm not.

There is no doubt Borderlines can be incredibly toxic and hurtful to the people around them. That is a very well known fact. But I also think just as many of you are a lovely great bunch of people who mean no harm on anyone. As I stated above, I don't in any way think you're all a bunch of manipulative assholes. So if you keep projecting and denying things all the time then it obviously means you can't handle the truth behind your disorder. This isn't healthy for you nor does it help break the stigma that you constantly face.

The reason I shared that video is because the woman in it has BPD herself. I just don't find her methods that effective for those who aren't in therapy. As I believe to have a successful relationship must require plenty of DBT lessons for this to work long term. So I shared it mainly for personal opinions etc. There is nothing negative or dehumanizing about it if you bothered to listen."
"Hello. I can relate to you in a way. I wouldn't consider myself anti-social, as I love to socialize with people who like the things that I do, however, I find it hard to find people that mesh well with me. I often find myself being a chameleon just to fit in with those around me. I was raised by an alcoholic Mother and a mentally and physically abusive Father. At one point I was also in Foster Care. These things led me to develop protective measures to ensure my confidence and self esteem never got to low. I begun seeing myself far more superior than what I really was and began thinking less of everyone around me. My dad thought scaring his kids was the best way to control them. I was scared to speak in public when I was a kid because I was raised to ""behave myself"" and to be quiet. My dad hardly ever verbally expressed his love for his kids however he showed it in his own way....Which was great looking back, but devastating growing up. I never felt like anything I did was good enough. I grow up reaching my personal milestones and he never said he was proud of me for anything until it was to late....I was to old to care about his admiration and approval but yet still found myself living my life as if I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Friends come and go and it can be hard to replace the good ones. But you will never find new ones if you stay inside and hide. Get out there and experience new things. Forget all the rules your mom set for you that kept you mentally and physically locked out of a social life....You gotta break those chains and just live for you mane. We all live our lives looking to share experiences with other people. Going at things be yourself can be very depressing. Your self worth can only be judged by you...no one else can dictate your value. You may be sensitive, but thats fine. Society has a stigma saying all men must be this or that, and I say fuck that...I cry all the time and guess what, I don't give a shit who sees me.

"Thank you so much for coming forwards with that and sharing your experiences too. As for the panic &lt;-&gt; terror. I think these types of semantics can be largely subjective. I personally found my experiences to be terrifying, but other accounts range from no to low anxiety, to moderate to severe panic to extreme. It's different for different people, and I suppose largely to do with the ability for the experiencer to emotionally handle the nature of the episodes.

As I've mentioned in other replies AIWS is commonly considered to be widely under-diagnosed due to it being largely unknown in the medical literature. It's a very niche and under discussed condition that may actually have afflicted many more people than has been officially quantified.

There is a large spectrum of sensory distortions and abnormalities that fall under the umbrella of possible experiencers of AIWS episodes, see here -&gt; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909520/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909520/)

It can manifest in various ways for each person and the combination of elements varies widely between individuals, though there is a distinct set of criteria that underpins the range of symptom combinations.

A lot of what you've described not only rings true to my experiences as a child, but fits this general category too. Think of ""AIWS"" as a *way of understanding the weirdness*.  A **syndrome** is simply a set of medical signs and symptoms that are correlated with each other. So *Alice in wonderland - Syndrome.* Is a way of medically quantifying the accounts of people that have this specific kind of weird, mind bending episodes.

Maybe you would also like to look through the google group to see if any of the other accounts ring any bells for you. -&gt; [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alice-in-wonderland-syndrome](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alice-in-wonderland-syndrome)

I'm glad my post has hit home for you with something you've probably had a lot of trouble processing and placing over the years (I'm certainly very familiar with that notion), and I hope, if you choose to look into the literature some more you may find some answers there too. It's personally been very healing for me to find out this is what's been going on. That there's a name for it and others that have gone through the same e.t.c."
Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder can coexist.

"Try changing your diet.  No carbs, no sugar. Gluten free. Paleo. "

YESSSS!!!! In what universe does that make sense??? Infuriating.
Yeah.  The other times were all unreported by me to begin with.

"thank you so much, this helped alot, hope your life goes amazing "
"12 hours is not long enough for your body to starve. I'd guess that most people go 12 or more hours without food and water during the night. I know I do. You could always drink a glass of water right before bed and have one waiting when you wake up, if it makes you that anxious. But I don't think that's the core issue. "
"Call someone. Your mom, your dad, a brother or sister, a friend or church leader. If you don't want to talk to someone you know, call the suicide hotline.

Did nothing for my trauma.  Yeah it all sounds fine and makes sense in the office talking about it but as soon as I left it all went out the window.  When I finally got correctly diagnosed with CPTSD  and started trauma therapy it started working.  None of the therapists I had seen before gave much weight to the trauma.

"I probably go something like 18 hours without food and water total though. I can’t drink before bed because I’ll have to get up to use the bathroom more, and I hate doing that because I’m too sleepy if I wake up before 12 hours, ya know? But do you have any other ideas? How can I address the core issue as you say?"
I wish you the best! I’m going to take your post as inspiration that my sister can do better one day too. She is currently in the thick of being unable to work/hospitalization periodically.

"If you picked out your brain you'd be left with all our problems in tact but none of the mitigating factors.

"I’m not American either. I live here...but I’m definitely not American.

Look I’ve being there and the first step is booking yourself up for some therapy /counselling.Its the hard truth but you can never have healthy relationships with out a healthy mind I speak from experience.Also I feel like opening up to a therapist would you help you a lot.I hope everything can work out well for you
"Music is great. What kind do you like listening to? Something I used to do in the past was memorize full songs: lyrics, instruments, timing, everything; so at times I was feeling off and couldn't listen to music I could ""play"" some of my favorite songs in my head to help me get through whatever I needed to at the time. "
"Okay, well thanks for being honest about that, but consider that maybe you're not the best person to discourage taking meds if you've never taken them. :)

For many people, meds are the *only* thing that work. That could include you.

I'm not pro- or anti-meds. I just believe in the right treatment for the right people."
"Research Partial Care Programs or Intensive Outpatient Programs in your area. Hospitals will have these, but there are also alternate facilities as well. 

Depending on your needs, programs like these will be anywhere from 2-5 days a week and run 3-5 hours a day with a mix of individual therapy and group based therapy. "
"Thank you for the advice! Having someone else's insight makes the situation seem a lot more conquerable. We live in a large city for our state, so hopefully I can look around and find some type of facility for them that can offer care for a reduced price.

"YES damn. I was put on two meds that had violent thoughts as a side effect. i told ppl about it but no one listened. so i had a psychotic break bc i couldnt get the violent thoughts out of my head. they were a form of ocd.

Seek help! earlier than i should have. early help is the best and you can get throgh that thing. "
"same story with me, i became so anxious about anything about her, even a little problem will take her to his suicidal thought. i seek for answer too dude, keep it strong. i'll suggest that both of us trying to calm about it, and seek advice from everyone, i mean, do not bottle it inside on your own, express your feeling"
"&gt;These are thoughts. Thoughts are neither good or bad, they are just thoughts. Our thoughts don't cause harm to others. Having violent thoughts doesn't make you a violent person. We aren't defined by our thoughts. You should have a read of /r/intrusivethoughts if you haven't already. Hopefully it will help. The thing about intrusive thoughts is that the more we try to fight them the more intense and regular they become.

Thanks, friend. I just worry because I feel that I've shown a pattern of acting out on it (from when I was young) and I'm afraid it'll happen again. "
"Are you Officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder?

I’m type one bipolar. I have experienced this as well, the mania and depression at once. It’s called a “mixed affective state”. You can read more about it [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_affective_state). 

Honestly, it’s probably the worst and scariest part of Bipolar disorder for me because I feel like a bubble waiting to burst, and never know if something is going to affect me one way or another. 

If you’d like, please feel free to DM me so we can discuss this more further.

Hang in there. "
"Drugs are sort of a medicine that right now, will make things way better, but in the long term make things worse. Try to remember that, tough as it is. Right now, drugs will be the best solution, but in the overall span of your life, will hold you back. It's just the truth; you will probably be tempted by them all your life, but if you at least acknowledge that reality, there is more hope of figuring out a better way. No judgement is being passed from me to you in the immediate future, but if we both know that drugs won't help long term, we have more knowledge as a tool."
"I get into funks all the time unfortunately, especially during times of high stress. I disconnect when this happens which isn't fair to my loved ones. Sometimes I try to do something out of the ordinary to shake it off. Step out of the routine. Go to the park,  I know sounds lame, I like going by the water,  feeling the breeze concentrating on the sound the water makes. Kinda like meditating right. Just get lost in something other than the bullshit. About the work thing...you need to take care of you, which includes not letting you or anyone else take ""you"" for granted. "
"I have a therapist I see and am on medication to help with PTSD induced seizures (PNES). That being said, yes I certainly do. Especially if I’ve had a bad disagreement with someone. Even if I was completely in the right, I feel like it’s all my fault. And it haunts me, dreams, thoughts, it colors all my daily interactions. The person I disagree with could be a complete stranger and it wouldn’t matter.  And in the end it always makes me wonder: is it like this because of my mental illness? Is that what people think of me? What would I be like if I were “normal”?"
"My dad went to Homewood for his addictions. He actually went back for a while after he was discharged to do talks and stuff. He enjoyed his time there, as much as one can under the circumstances, I think. He took the programming seriously, and gained a lot from his time there. I feel like the skills he learned in Homewood helped him to be successful once he was back home. He still goes to NA meetings every week, and is actually quite active within his home group. It’s been at least 10 years since he was there. I’d be happy to ask him some questions, if you’d like. "
"No one here is going to give you tips on how to kill yourself. 

I looked through your post history and you mentioned that you’re 17. You haven’t even begun living yet! Life is completely different after highschool and when you become an adult. I know. I had to suffer through highschool knowing that I wasn’t going to graduate, suffering from chronic illness, and forced to go to school even though I didn’t have a chance to pass. I wanted to end it, just get rid of all the stress and pain. But I didn’t. And now I’m okay. I do dog walking as a “job” since I’m disabled, I have a succulent farm as a hobby, and I’m preparing to get my GED soon and go to college next year.

So as much as life may not seem worth living now, it’ll eventually get better. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. "
"This is terrible and is definitely discrimination! For one thing, you were talking privately. For another thing, you should have the right to say something publicly anyway.

If you were talking about suicide/self harm I'd understand a bit more but I'd still think your manager has a duty of care to follow up anything they've heard. 

Do you have a union? I'm in the UK and used my union for mental health stuff in the past. I'd be unhappy about this situation and I'd be asking for some advice,  not because you necessarily want to broadcast your MH issues but more because you feel like you've been silenced from mentioning anything all because of an overly sensitive and old fashioned colleague who needs to get a grip and ask themselves if they'd have the same problem if they overheard someone talking about their broken ankle. "
"Extreme agitation, delusions, paranoia and substance abuse (to cope with all of the aforementioned) are all early warning signs of schizophrenia.

Getting someone involuntarily committed to a psych unit is very hard unless they are violent, either towards themselves or others. The small work around you *might* be able to use in this case to get a medical professional to work with you on involuntarily committing him would  be  his lack of compliance with his current medications and violent outbursts.

The best you can do at this moment is get yourself and his family to start making logs of all his behavior, delusions, etc and try to get him in to see a mental health specialist (the more dates and specifics, the better). Try and make a timeline to provide to his eventual case manager so they have an idea what they are working with and how long he has been experiencing this decompensation. If you absolutely don't know where to start looking for such a professional, call your local homeless shelter and they can give you a reasonable referral. Trust me, they do it all the time."
"I'm not saying it's recreational, I'm just saying that if you try to see a doctor, maybe you'll find a way to live your life to its fullest without having to resort to hard drugs, and also without weird feelings. I know it sucks right now, I know how fucking bad it is... But you know, try everything possible before commiting suicide. I wouldn't want you to die. I actually think that if heroin and oxy helps you, maybe a doc would know exactly whats bothering you to this extreme and will find something less damaging and helping on a long term. You know, if you are really thinking about suicide, whats the cost of trying to get better? What you feel is temporary, even if its hard to grasp sometimes, suicide is permanent... Have you tried calling a suicide hotline? A quick google search will tell you where to call in your area. It could be your first step to get these feeling out! Please tell me you'll think about it at least. I really think you would feel better if you get some help. I'm concerned dude, I really want you to see how quickly you can really get better, and way safer than with heroin... Please tell me you'll try.
You say you don't want to hurt your mother, she would probably be really proud to see you getting help and I don't know her, but as a parent, I would be proud. Please, don't do something to hurt yourself. "

"Not 100% sure because I’m not a mental health expert.

"This might be completely stupid, but I never said anything about 'stopping', just slowing down. While running a marathon you want to go at a pace you can keep up.

"do you think your mom's a tad narcissistic? try to appeal to their sense of self interest. if you get a fancy degree you can get a fancy job which = more money you can share with them, especially in old age. just saying if they don't have any empathy for your situation, there's no point in appealing to what isn't there. "
"Anti-depressant don't give addiction/dependency

Marijuana and its derivatives are depressants and give hallucinations. From prolonged use it will have low dependency since it has calming effect. I advice you don't use it unless you want to feel depressed then thats another story.

If you feel dependant cut down your anti-depressant ""slowly"" week by week to reduce any adverse effects if you feel down bump it up. 

Note always tell your therapist about it and think it as much and as hard as you can, make a list about the good and bad things and the de ide but give it time."
"Hi, a few more thoughts. Sorry if you are sick of talking about this disturbed individual. You can't help him, but you can help yourself. Broken record technique: ""I cannot talk. Please call 1-800-273-8255 (number of suicide hotline) if this is serious."" There are red flags about his behavior; look over this wheel of power and control: [http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf)

Best thing for you is to keep distance from him. I would be sympathetic if you need to block his number on your phone."
"I think there's more power to you to have a rather peaceful (more-so quiet)  mind than one full of obtrusive thoughts. I used to be the same way and thought something was wrong with me and now that I compulsively narrate and judge EVERYTHING beyond my control I wish it could just be blank. You may just be bored. Perhaps depressed but I would recommend doing things that stimulate you and maybe just dive in a little more towards the roots of things, but don't go too far... Maybe look in to Philosophy, pick up a new hobby, but analyze and try to really appreciate the roots. "
"I understand how you feel. We're all in the same boat, feeling like that. 

What works for me is, just taking one day at a time. I dont get too tied up in thinking about the weeks and months if Im really unwell. If I can just get through the day - living as well as possible - then the weeks and months will take care of themselves. 

I dont know if that helps, but try not to put too much pressure on yourself while you are recovering. Try and be kind and patient with yourself as possible. Keep your life really simple if you can, and as low-key and low-stress as possible  

"
"I understand. You're so use to feeling a certain way that now there's a hole there. But i don't think feeding it is the best way to go about it. Maybe try to invest in more hobbies? Or spend more time with family and friends, start having more goals and try and plan to do more things. It's unfair on yourself to keep pulling yourself back into that ditch, if you feel better and suddenly that comes over you again, go get help, meditate and try to prevent it, change your thoughts. Obviously it's not going to cure your depression and anxiety, but it'll try to fill that hole. "
"I'm the same. In the past, I was extremely affected by my illness, losing work, dropping out of college, etc. Now, thankfully I'm very high functioning, and people are surprised about my illnesses. I try to discuss things with doctors in a non emotional way, I make sure I know my medications and their active ingredients, I want them to know I'm in control, and maybe they'll take me more seriously. If they were to look into my history though, they'd be surprised. I'm in a new country as of a year ago, and my worst moments were years before that, so they can't see anything."
"Most aren’t going to answer but I’ve had the same type of weird thoughts cross my mind. I don’t think it’s normal but something some people do. If I ever have a weird thought like that I just shake my head and move on. It’s very strange. Mine are normally punching someone, but always someone I’m close to and getting along great with. Meds have helped. I haven’t had those thoughts in a long time. If you need someone to talk to it’s PM me. It may be morning before I get back to you but I will answer ASAP. Sorry you’re having these issues. I know they suck."
"So, hearing your name called in a crowed place is actually an extremely common hallucination. Loads of people get this, and it doesn’t indicate a problem unless it causes you significant distress and impairment. Ditto to hallucinating at night around sleeping times. Those nighttime ones are called hypnogogic or hypnopompic hallucinations depending on if you have them as you’re falling asleep or as you’re waking up. It’s not necessarily a sign of psychosis. Like I said, it’s super common. It’s even described in the ending of Kermit’s song Rainbow Connection. "
"it angered me too, when people say things like that. did they think it was easy? did they think i didn't try?

when i confided to my 'friend' she told me something similar to what you wrote, but she didn't even look me in the eye or sound sympathetic. more frustrated than anything that her homework machine (me) is breaking down.

but honestly at least they pretended to care. you've heard it a thousand times probably but im sorry about your mom, i didn't go through the same stuff you did or suffer the same despair. my words are likely useless but i just wanted you to know."
"to be honest, it’s not your or your boyfriends place to help her. and are you just assuming she’s  anorexic/bulimic because she’s skinny? she could be perfectly happy with herself, if she’s dangerously skinny or is having physical difficulties then an intervention might be necessary. but not every skinny person has a mental disorder. have you actually tried talking to her? even just a simple “is everything okay? i’m worried about you” etc. you could end up pushing her away if you spring all of this on her if she is actually suffering from a mental disorder. "
"wow, it sounds almost as if you had an epiphany ???!  maybe something in your mind just clicked? This must be terribly confusing for you, as it is for everyone else around you, but these changes all sound very positive and beneficial. I'm actually a bit envious, but really, good for you! If you have developed any serious medical issues then its worth seeing a doctor for, but there doesnt seem to be any rush in figuring out what actually happened to you (since its all good!) I found your story very mysterious and interesting. Good luck with your second chance at life :) ! "
"Anxiety can be pretty tricky,  and it can appear in different ways. I would say that your anxiety or panic attack evolve in that sens.

Anxiety made my heartbeats skip, another time it was constant stomach pain (2 years of that), lower belly pain (few months), ear pain, knees pain, lips eczema...name it! Everytime there was a reason related to it : bad relationship, basics need not being fulfill, shitty work, etc. And everytime I fix one of these things, the symptoms went away!maybe you just need to sit down and ask yourself since when you have to attacks, and with what it coincides. You might have your answer there.

Also, it might just be really bad heartburn! Try and ask your doctor about it.  I had that too, normal antacid never had an effect on me. Doctors can prescribe pantoprazole or something like that.

Good luck!"
"Extreme emotions, impulsivity and trying to be the perfect girlfriend as well. All sounds awfully familiar and I’m diagnosed BPS. Finally getting the right diagnosis and treatment (MBT) at 26 really made a HUGE difference for me. I’d encourage you to express your worries to your girlfriend and suggest you see another doctor together (if you’re up for that of course), emphasizing you love her no matter what and that you hate to see her suffering like this and with the right help she could actually start feeling better. Emphasizing that it’s about her, not about you, is key. Otherwise she’ll probably think she’s disappointing and hurting you - so be very explicit about the fact she is not. You sound like an awesome boyfriend, genuinely worried and loving and not judgmental at all, so I suspect you’ll do great. "
"Thanks for your reply! Basically I haven't got better or made any progress the last time I was there few months back. I want to discuss other options for me, now I have given talk therapy a good go and unfortunately it is not doing the trick for me, no matter how much I keep at it. If anything I have got worse, like not being able to hold down a job or make an interview. I want to see what suggestions they have as it is affecting me daily, from career, education prospects to my eating habits and poor sleep schedule. I have been all over the place, and despite me trying my best, it is now frustrating me how I am still in the same position as before with no or very limited changes. I want to express how a bad event, really causes my mind to go off the rails a lot more than other people and I have extreme reactions to things."
"Just a couple of tips that I wish people told me BEFORE I started therapy. I'm a fairly new therapy go-er, myself, so I hope this is helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Give the therapist a chance. I'd say give them at least 5 sessions.

After 5 sessions, if you don't feel better leaving the session, it's OK to try another therapist. (Obviously if you want to give them a couple more sessions, absolutely do!)

That doesn't mean the therapist isn't good at their job, they just might not be a good match for you.

You should be feeling BETTER each time you leave a session.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end this has to be for YOU and nobody else.

&amp;#x200B;

GOOD LUCK!! You're doing a great thing! The BEST thing!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. The 5 session rule doesn't apply if they downright make you feel like SHIT on the first appt. I had one that said ""I sense self-loathing"" in our first session. I mean, perhaps it's not completely false, but I don't hate myself. I have insecurities. It just made me feel like shit. I went to her one more time, just to give her a chance, but she definitely wasn't for me."
"Disclaimer, I’m not a professional clinician, &amp; I can’t diagnose. But I am an academic in a related field, so here are grain-of-salt reactions. First of all, memories are notoriously unreliable. That said, however, it’s striking that you are able to recall unusual details that you wouldn’t be expected to remember, especially given that your memory isn’t all that good. 

Second, although you may not be able to get positive, definitive evidence that you experienced abuse, you can approach it a different way to try to get some answers: make an inference to the best explanation for why you would have these ideas/memories in the first place. In other words, all things considered, what best explains these stark but vague images being impressed upon your mind? Were/are you an imaginative child? Could it have been from watching such a scene on tv? Is it possible you dreamed it? Etc. If all these possible explanations seem too farfetched, then the best explanation might be that it actually happened. (Now whether “it” means you were abused, it’s hard to say, since you don’t (as of now) have any memories of that. If you were, likely you would’ve repressed the memory; if you weren’t, you would have no memory of something that didn’t happen. In either case, it would explain you having no recollection of that.)"
"I think flashes of anger like this are pretty common when dealing with trauma. It's important to draw a distinction between what your imagination can project and what you would actually do in reality. It's a delicate issue because I don't want to say ""don't worry about it so much"" if there is a legitimate concern that you might actually act on one of these impulses. It sounds like you wouldn't, but that's not a judgement I feel I should make.

What I will say is that these flashes sound like a symptom of trauma that hasn't been properly addressed. Please try to seek out therapy to help you discuss these things and bring them to the surface in a safe and controlled way, otherwise they may continue to bubble up in explosive thoughts like the ones you described. That isn't a good way to live and your brain is trying to tell you something. Listen to it and find a trained professional who can help you. I think this is the best thing you can do to move forward.

Try to convince your parents to get that help for you. You don't have to tell them everything, but if you can at least convince them to get you into therapy then you will be on the right track to begin resolving your issues. There's no shame whatsoever in admitting to your parents that you need help. If they can't understand that then they are at fault, not you. Good luck."
"It's great to be able to see things from others perspectives. I wish more people were capable of that. What you do with that capability is the part you have to be careful of. Even if you can understand or sympathize with someone, you should still look at their actions, confirm their motives, and deal with it appropriately. Don't hang on to so-called toxic or dangerous people just because you sympathize with them, for example. 

 I can understand the mentality/fantasies/motives/etc of many murderers and pedophiles, but that doesn't mean I support or forgive their actions and don't think they deserve punishment. I know the pedophilia thing will get me some down votes but I'm just trying to be honest and I am speaking from a logical sense not a feelings of sympathy sense. Believe me, even though I say I can understand their motives and psychological issues doesn't mean I wouldn't beat one to a breathless pulp if I happened upon such a situation. Child abuse is a zero tolerance situation for me.

Anyway, being able to be open minded and such can make you a great counselor, mentor, or supervisor. In my experience, it can make you more approachable and others can come to you with their problems easier since you are probably not just a walking wall of judgement and can help them reflect and make changes or push through a situation."
"Well I actually don’t know much of anything about code. I just figured I’d share with you my plans if anything unfortunate were to happen to my future (currently 18). 

From my understanding, you don’t actually have to be good at math at all. The required courses in college for CS are mostly put in place to make you a good problem solver (ex: calculus). Coding is all about problem solving. 

I’ve heard a lot of people suggest python because it’s pretty straight forward in terms of how the lines of code are written, but you shouldn’t worry much about how easy one language is or another. Find something you want to make. It can be something as small as a little calculator app or it can be as daunting as a full-functioning game. Then find a language of code that will match your goals. How you will find this - I don’t know. Google is everyone’s best friend! Something to keep in mind about learning languages of code is that they’re literally new  **languages**. Much like learning a foreign language like French, Chinese, German, etc. (relative to whatever foreign is to you) It’s not going to be easy the first few times you attempt to learn them. Coding languages are no different. Find something you’re passionate about in the CS space, and work small from there. Everyone starts as an amateur. I believe in you! "
"Oh, I didn't miss the point at all. You don't think that for a few years of my life I was barely able to pay rent? I was just like 99% of the population. I get it. It sucks. This is Reddit. I understand that I'm likely talking to people in their early 20s - i.e. people who likely make an average of $2,000/month (if that). Give it 10 years. You think people in their early 30s are still making that same salary? No. It's just part of the (shitty) process.

&amp;#x200B;

The statement posed was that of someone who doesn't feel financial progress. Progress is very slow moving for most people. That was one of the things I was implying. It took me 15 years of work to get where I am now. It took me 10 years to get to $3,000/month. And while I am currently an outlier (regarding salary), if it wasn't for luck, I understand that right now I'd probably be making around $4,000/month. Additionally, I wanted to let people who make a ""shit"" salary know that making a good salary isn't worth it most of the time, especially when it comes to your mental health. Finding a sweet spot is the key. If you can save $1,000/month, chances are you will end up enjoying your life and your mental health will be in good condition. It seems to me that most people nowadays place too much emphasis on money (probably due to social media and desires to take perfect pictures along the beaches in Hawaii all day, every day). This just adds to poor mental health. Being able to clock in a 9AM and leave at 5PM with no thoughts about work is the best for people suffering from poor mental health. That's all I was saying."
"8th, and yes? Not exactly sure how any of this is relevant though. "
"Also female, but I feel like I say dude and man a lot �� sorry "
Anything that's causing you distress could benefit from counseling
Be honest with your therapist and get his/her professional opinion.
For anyone wondering where to report this: https://www.fbi.gov/tips
Her mom wasn't as supportive. How can I tell that she is in danger?
I can sorta relate. I've smoked a lot of weed these last few days.
"I do know what I’m talking about, you just don’t agree with it."
"I do the we thing a lot. I'll also say ""you"" when talking to myself"
"I haven't self diagnosed anyone. hospital told her its depression.
"
I'll have to ask her about that. Thanks for your help appreciate it
Marijuana is classified as a stimulant. What are you talking about?
"No matter what it is, I would get out of there as soon as possible."
Or at the very least switch to tea. The L-theanine helps me a lot.
"Psychosis because of weed and ""just super high"" are the same thing."
"Search the phrase, it describes this situation with you pretty well"
"Side note: I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADD "
"Thank you so much, I needed this. This made me feel so much better "
That's just what a death who is trying to kill you would say.....XD
Weed don’t sit well with me anymore apparently hah I wish it did
Would you mind explaining what benefits/risks you are referring to?
"Yeah, I would be OK with that. :) Good point. I like how you think."
"Yes, I know of Jung and have read quite a bit of his but not those."
You have cured a mental illness by not using your phone that much??
i mean... i think i don't need to talk to a therapist about that...
i miss those days. back before they were corrupted by their mother.
weed did this to me. I'm seeing a lot of stuff about DPDR lately...
"Awww...I just want to hug you so badly and tell you it will be OK. I am a Mama myself, so I understand. I am sure it is hard for her too. I would look at our daughter's empty bunk (she shared bunk beds with her sister) and sob uncontrollably for hours. 

&lt;3 sending lots of hugs and love your way. It will get easier. :)"
"Coming up on 5 years November 27th for me. The first couple of years were difficult, I couldn't stop myself going back to those moments and reliving it in a sense. But now it's easier, though I still feel a bit weird on that day.

I'm glad you're still here, friend. Good luck on your continued mental health journey. &lt;3"
"Does that mean you easily feel attacked? Because I can kinda relate to this post because of this. I don't see people as my enemies, but maybe the other way around. As if I'm the enemy, if something isn't ""good"" or ""right"" about me and someone points it out.    
I feel always attacked and hurt, and I wanna change that tbh "
Good I'm glad you found it helpful. It's a good routine to get into doing every day even if it's only 5 or 10 min. It's too bad they wouldn't do anything on here as a PR but at least they were willing to work with people on a one on one basis. I might have to try and contact them and see what they can do. Thanks for that!
"I tried a group therapy in which I ended up not really opening up about my personal self at all because I got extremely cautious and only gave out the instances and anecdotes from my life which concern me the least.

Will try it again in a different setup and see if it helps. Did it help you personally or anyone you know?"
"I will bring it up with my therapist this week. Also I'm going to post in the OCD sub, see if I can get some more answers. My therapist just says they're ""anxious thoughts"" but I think she doesn't understand the gravity and toll it takes on me. Thank you though, I'll see if my library has that book, or something similar. "
"If you were actively considering doing anything inappropriate with an underage person, them worry and seek help. If that's not what's happening, don't beat yourself up. 

You might want to post on/r/sexover30 . They are a very sage community for all sexual matters. 

From what you've said, you have nothing to worry about."
"It can be. Especially in men, myself included, there's always social competition, depending on a person's personality can affect how willing they are to fight for the top, I.e be the coolest. If you're not that willing you may wait until the time is right, like yourself, and then proceed to take control of the situation. "
"It’s great that you’re both supporting one another, but this is probably not going to become a long term thing. Maybe you could support each other by seeking help at the same time and being there throughout the treatment. 


Good for you both for wanting to help though! It really helps to have someone to support you. "
"Ok, my main question is how you make sense of psychological abuse that is unintentional.  Where the abuser isn't aware of what they're doing.

For those who were not in cults, maybe they have a family dynamic they can relate to where one sibling walked away unscathed, and the other with symptoms of psychological trauma.  "
People tell me I'm too hard on myself I guess I just have to work on it no matter what. I have these episodes frequently but with myself. For once I kind of blew up and asked for help for once. Maybe it was the quitting of drugs and i couldnt sleep. But i finally have slept and reading these comments help alot. Thank you.
"Thank you!! 

I try to isolate myself as much as possible, which is what got me thinking about this in the first place... isolated me feels much better than non-isolated me....

I feel like I have more clarity when I’m alone, can see things better, make progress....

It just sucks I can’t leave the environment (yet). "
"The issue is when you stop blaming yourself you lose your sense of control over the situation.  When things are your fault you can always change them by being better.  

What do you do when you finally think you are doing things right and it's not getting any better.  It feels like the guilt is just replaced by despair.  "
"This sounds like something you should speak to a physician about. I will say that my medication causes me to yawn excessively, but I don’t have any of those other symptoms you’re describing. I only had heart flutters when my anxiety was at its worst and the first couple of weeks starting my meds, but those went away. "
"You should tell her how you feel about it. I sort of get where your coming from in a similar way. I’m 29 and have a college degree, but my wife is 28 and an attorney, meaning she has more education and a better job than I’ll probably ever have. I have had to figure out that my self worth is not in my accomplishments. "
"yes. speaking from experience. severe depression made my thinking ability significantly impaired, and also affected my memory. One of the most noticeable cognitive aspects was an inability to make basic decisions about simple things. Before I was ill, and after I recovered, these were never an issue. It really is a thing."
"He cheated on her so he can fuck off. He broke her trust, no relationship without trust, so he can live and learn the consequences. Tough it out, pal! Your proximity to his ex has him lingering to be closer to her. He’s violating your rights as he has hers. You asked him to seek professional help; he has refused and that is his choice to live with not yours. You are not professional help or a midnight doormat. Try your best to not engage. He violates your boundaries, he is not a friend. At this point, his ex should file a restraining order to start documenting his abuse."
"Hello! 

I completely understand you as I had those symptoms before I was diagnosed with chronic depression. 

My best advice for you is to try to get out of your comfort zone and I know it may sound cliche but doing thins different like exercise or yoga or eating differently it helps. However, the best you can do is get recorded everything you do for the next month, including your mood swings and what you were doing before any of those happen and go with a psychologist in order for him/her to give you a better diagnosis.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope you feel better soon! "
"I'd of course suggest revisiting the meds route, but otherwise I'd found the 'five things' exercise to be somewhat useful when my anxiety is high. If you haven't heard of it, it's the basic find five things you can hear, see, smell and touch. I thought it sounded dumb, but it turned out to be a decent way to distract my brain and calm down without really realising it (because actually trying to calm down makes things worse). I find often that once I stop the exercise my anxiety creeps back in again, but it's useful in a pinch if you're trying to stop yourself from fleeing."
"Yes- seek help. If you can't afford a therapist, many offer a sliding scale based on income so they reduce the cost. Also if you live in the US then there's community mental health clinics for every county- it is legally obligated to have one. They offer free therapy and other mental health services. If you're ""not poor enough"" as in no medicare/medicaid, they also offer very cheap sliding scale options.  Meds are part of the equation but not everything so I would suggest at least attempting to get help on both ends and hopefully one of them will work out well. Good luck! "
"You just survive, one day at a time. Celebrate each day as a victory. Eventually, it will get easier. Look for things that lighten your heart and create a routine for yourself comprised of those things. For example, is there a feel-good show that makes you laugh, or at least forget for awhile? Watch it, starting with the first episode of the first season, in your favorite, most comfortable clothes and eating your favorite food/snack. I do this a lot, and even if I finish the series, I'll start it right back over when I find myself in that dark place. I hope this helps. ❤"
"Zoloft the one your taking like every other anti-depressant is not a magic drug that will yake your sadness away. Antidepressants only change the serotonin, norepinephrine reuptake(excess) in the system.
In English it only makes you think clearly and eases depression. People often mistake that antidepressants gives happiness think of it as a vitamin for the brain the longer(of course if the medication works) is in the body the better results you will have. You will still experience every other emotion like everybody else just that sadness wont feel like a punch in the gut."
"Accidentally deleted my reply. But yeah, I have nothing to prove to you. Goading me won't work. If you don't believe me I have years of post history where I state over and over again what my job is. If you think I'd go to those lengths to beat you in an argument, you have serious problems... As you apparently believe I can predict the future years in advance. 

You don't agree? Don't care. You're not a professional and have no idea what you're talking about. If you want to continue being wrong, continue.

Since there's no basis for a complaint, I'm good thanks. Of course, you can always contact the NHS and tell them what you intend to tell my managers. I'm sure they'll take it very seriously and will care a great deal that you disagree with me. I bet they'll hunt me down and execute me - where there's a will, there's a way!"
"Are the anti-depressants you take SSRIs? I took an SSRI (sertraline, I assume sertralina is similar?) for a few months and experienced very strong dissociation symptoms like you described. I switched to 300mg bupropion (generic Wellbutrin) and found they worked much better for me. I'm no expert and I only have my own personal experience to go on, but from what you said it sounds like the meds you are on may not right for you. I'm not familiar with how legality and finances in Chile differ from the USA or what your financial situation is, but I think it may be a good idea to consider alternatives if it's possible. Also, I think a year is more than enough time to decide whether or not an antidepressant is right or not. I'm baffled because I've never had a psychiatrist encourage me to continue something I wasn't on board with."
"Yep. It feels good to have someone who understands. It bothers me that I can't admit it, and since I'm not ""diagnosed"" yet, I am not allowed to say I have that issue here. Seriously, what the hell else can it be and why would I need that validation when I KNOW there is an issue and what it is in MY heart? I mean self-diagnosis is a fool's game a lot of the time but this is SO specific, that there's no doubt. I don't need a damn doctor telling me what I already kind of know. It makes me sick when I think of that word and my mind keeps telling me that it will pass...etc. It won't let me acknowledge it so I can move on.

Sorry to vent there a little. There was a post a while back asking why ppl claim to have (whatever disorder it is) and they aren't diagnosed and it irritated me to no end. 

Hang in there. I am here for you!!!"
"I experienced for the longest time the same thing. In my currently relationship. My feeling that way made it really hard for me to feel things were real in my relationship, and made it hard on my SO. It caused some disagreements. Hes never dealt with or known someone with my issues. I opened up about my issues and after years of bottling it up it's been hard to try to keep some stuff in. I feel so comfortable with him I let him know exactly how I feel all the time, and he got really worried about how negative my thoughts were. Its was very hard for him to wrap his head around the fact that I didnt see myself as someone who deserves him, and I always thought he'd leave me. And as of recent he will be moving to Alaska, and I will be staying here for another six months before I move up there with him. We will get married but not before he leaves. This worries me to my core because he could completely ghost me and never look back. But I take little moments to think about the little things ,the times I've felt so loved when I've been with him. And the feelings melt away. Starting to love yourself first definitely helps. The negative parts aren't going to go away. But you can subdue them. Live with them. Not let them rule your life. You are not alone. It can be done. Start with yourself and then allow another to be there with you. "
"I just have a difficult time getting interested in things. A few months ago is when I really pushed myself to step out of my comfort zone. This is also when I found my girlfriend. She was really the only ‘thing’ I tried which I enjoyed.

I’ve tried caving, rock climbing, hiking, camping, board games, cooking, piano, billiards, gaming, movies/television, going to the gym, dog sitting, some drugs, some different forms of volunteering, staring at a wall, discovering new music, writing in a diary, sleeping, reading, audiobooks, learning new things (computers, philosophy, history, science, psychology, nutrition), tutoring kids, working in a grocery store, and college. 

I tried most of those a few months ago, and then the rest maybe a year or two ago. I used to spend all my time gaming, but I got tired of it. 

I have a part time job which I dislike, and I’m taking 13 hours in college which isn’t enjoyable either. The only enjoyment I’ve been able to find is her. I can try joining some club or sports club again and see what happens.

And I agree with you on everything. I do think it’s more attractive if someone has a passion. If I could pick something and be passionate about it, I’d do it in a heartbeat. Just nothing clicks with me. I don’t know why. I feel like I’m just making my life difficult for no reason. "
"I have no first hand experience with this, but my best friend experienced something very similar last Easter so I hope this offers some relief. Initially she thought she felt sick because of a hangover, but then it didn't go away. She felt sick before she went to class, before she went out for food with friends or other activities she used to be fine with. It got a lot worse right before she went out, she was terrified of being sick in a taxi or car. She knew it was anxiety related because she was completely fine in her dad's car, since she could ask him to stop any time so she could be sick. And she felt fine when she was just at home, it only got bad when she had to go out and she was scared that she'd throw up. 
She's a lovely and really social person who enjoys partying and going out with friends most of the time, so it was pretty strange for her that this popped up out of the blue. I think it helped her that she could tell her friends and family about it and we understood, we tried to be supportive and assure her that it's ok if she needs to go or if she's sick. she also had some short term counselling with her university because it's free in my country.  If this is possible I'd definitely recommend it. Also, if you think it's really stopping you from going in, definitely let your course tutor know. You sound like you need some support so let people know that you need it :)
This happened over Easter this year and she is completely fine now, so I just wanted to tell you that it was really really awful but with dedication she got through it. I totally believe you will start feeling better, in the mean time just make sure your uni knows you're sick so that they are understanding instead of questioning you and making your anxiety worse. I'm going to message her now for you and ask whether she has any tips on what helped her :)"
"Man that’s rough and I’m sorry about what you’re going through, and I’m also very sorry about what she’s going through as well, I know what it’s like on her end, for I’m in a pretty dark place myself, I haven’t resorted to self harm but I feel for her heavy soul. 

Now what I’m about to say isn’t in any way to disrespect your beliefs and/or teachings, but if she doesn’t want to engage in religious activities, don’t make her, it’ll just make y’all’s rift grow even more steadily. She’s trying to figure out who she is as person, and from my experience in my 19 years of living, I still haven’t found myself either, I’m not even sure if anybody ever finds who they truly are.

And you have to be there to support her no matter how “obscene” she looks, she seems like she’s a fragile being who just wants to be able express herself, and the resentment that she has towards y’all might have to with y’all’s judgments towards her. She’s misunderstood and if you really take the time to hear her out and not just try to push her into reforming to y’all’s expectations, y’all will realize the nice girl you thought left has been there the whole time, just hiding under too much baggage to handle by herself. 

My dad told me “drugs aren’t the problem, they’re the solution” and I agree with him, but not in the sense that they’re necessarily good, but when someone is addicted to a drug wether it be prescription or street drugs, it’s because that’s the only thing they have to turn to. Nobody with mental health problems want to vent out their feelings just to be ridiculed. She might just be over encumbered with thoughts that she’s suppressing to herself because she thinks nobody would give a damn.

Once again, I mean no disrespect towards you or your family, I’m not religious personally but I understand why people are. Mental health is such a tricky thing and the mind is very lucrative, just be there for her, not in a helicopter type of way, but just let her know that she’s not alone in this. It’s a damn tough fight but there’s only so much bad you can endure before your luck starts changing. Make sure she knows she is NOT a burden to society, there’s nothing worse than having that feeling. 

I know I don’t have the answers but I hope that some of my words can help you out."

That I hasn't need to wait until I had a breakdown to ask for help.
The hardest parts are always temporary. That's what I remind myself.
Therapy doesn't really do much for me. Neither does anti-depressants
This is one of the most unfathomably idiotic things I've ever read.

"By the way, I was hit by an extremely abusive person. All the clinic did was PROTECT!! that abuser.

"Go see an actual therapist too. That's my advice. It'll give you somebody to release these thoughts and feelings to. I can tell you from my own personal experience that taking medication can only do so much. Sure, it helps. But you also need to get this stuff out of your system. And that's where going to therapy will help."

Take care OP. You're not alone. Keep on keeping on."
I can't give you an answer to that. I've been miserable for years. I don't even know what true happiness feels like. The only thing I do all day is browse reddit and sometimes workout.

I was diagnosed and treated for depression with antidepressants when i was 21. Never felt depressed until my 30s i wish o never went on antidepressants.

If you have trouble talking to her could you possibly write her a note or a letter and maybe slip it under her pillow or something or leave it somewhere she’ll find it? You can do it right before you leave for school maybe and let her know in the note that you’ll try to talk about it as best you can when you get home?
"In Ireland, the response to ""how are you doing"" is ""hows it going"", or ""how are you doing"", right back. They're just a throw away phrase.

"Any professional who talks about 'sociopath disorder' doesn't know their shit. 

Sociopathy hasn't been an official medical diagnosis for a long time; what we have now is ASPD (Anti-Social Personality Disorder) and psychopathy as defined by certain questionnaires. Furthermore, C-PTSD, autism and a bunch of other disorders can result in reduced or lack of (emotional/affective) empathy, sense of self, ability to feel emotions, etc.

In other words, there are a _lot_ of people who might identity with the pop-psy identity of 'sociopath', and yes, they can totally be self-aware!"
"Giving someone time to process their emotions and make an informed decision when there's no adrenaline running through the body isn't a sign of weakness. I mean, I'm trying to be proactive about this shitshow.

If it was just a girlfriend, I'd totally be with you. But I believe that when you choose to marry someone, you at least try everything you can to make it work and don't give up until all those avenues are tested."
"I can't say much about what might be wrong with him or how he could get better but please do everything you can to protect your own safety. If he threatens you in any way, keep a log of it (screenshot texts, record calls) and file a police report. If he does anything illegal, call the police.

Sounds like he has some real issues and I'm glad you got out, but make sure you don't get complacent with your safety. I don't want to encourage any kind of paranoia but this situation does seem risky based on what you've said.

I hope he manages to get better, for both of your sakes."
"I don’t know much about PTSD and hadn’t thought about it, but when I urge her about getting help I’ll relay it to her so she could mention it to a therapist/psychologist/whoever she may speak to. Thank you!

Also, I had mention her mother despising professionals in the psychology department because of her being blamed for half of my gf’s behaviors. What is a safe way of helping my gf receive help without her knowledge? I was thinking maybe something on campus. I know my previous college had therapists but I don’t know if they’re licensed for something like this."
"My wife isn't threatening to leave our family, she would never do that. She's just at her wit's end and told my daughter that if she gets hospitalized again she's not welcome back at the house. About the 'illness' thing, she has made conscious decisions in the past to not be like this and has been successful. She just doesn't want to try, and that's not my fault. And I'm convinced that she learned most of her sinful ways from the other delinquents she met during her various psychiatric hospitalizations, so I'm very hesitant to willingly send her to a place like that again. "
"MyDoor, it is important that you obtain professional treatment ASAP instead of waiting 3 years.  Because you are so young, you are still in a formative period that makes it easier to address your issues.  If you wait 3 more years, however, the issues are going to be more ingrained and harder to treat.

Can't you impress upon your parents how miserable you are without them having to reveal your suicidal ideation to the military?  That is, why can't you persuade them you need treatment for issues that go well beyond simple anxiety -- without forcing a move back to the States?"
"I know you mean well, but that's not the best thing to do for someone who has delusions.  You are only encouraging the person to try to convince you that their delusions are real.  

You should never agree to go along with anyone's delusions but instead try to sympathise with them only to say that you'll be there for them but you are unable to see what they see / understand where they are coming from / hear what they hear.

If she were to go with her friend to ""the source of the noise"" and say something like ""I don't hear it"", it will only make her friend spiral deeper into her delusion that nobody believes her. Which is why it's so important never to give the opportunity for a delusional person to try to convince you what they are thinking is real.  The goal is to try to steer them away from that by trying to get them help."
"Yeah man I know what that's like. My friends back home treated me like shit. I think in life you teach people how to treat you and if you've allowed your peers to treat you like shit for long enough then it becomes hard for people to see you any differently. I lived in a beautiful house on six and a half acres and then after a year my friend who owned the place asked me to leave due to ""not fitting in"". I was isolating myslelf because the house was becoming a social house with people dropping in all the time and I'm a bit of an introvert. Plus I was working as a baker doing insane hours. Then I sold all my shit and mover to another state in hope of a better life... It hasn't happened yet. But all that being said I think we've gotta wait a bit longer till we decide to do something drastic. I'm 25. At least wait till your 30. "
"I guess it didn't bother me as much when I was younger because then I lived with my family and I still had *some* form of connection and daily interaction with people I knew and felt comfortable around.

I guess I enjoy music, I go to concerts and festivals on quite a regular basis. I'm trying to play the guitar more too. I like writing and reading. I dunno. I do a bunch of drugs, lol (within reasonable boundaries, of course). I absolutely love traveling but just don't have the means for it. Overall I just like trying new things and activities, but I guess (but this is just another assumption), because I'm so all over the place, it might make it harder to connect to me, I think.

I do feel kinda called out on the yoga class one tho, cuz that was kinda exactly what I was doing :')

I don't *think* I'm any of the negative things you mentioned, maybe annoying? What makes a person annoying? :/

Thanks for your reply tho, it did make me feel a little better :)"
"Don’t let anyone make you feel like you don’t need help. You are doing therapy and taking meds and they are helping you. I have days where I feel like I could literally take on Muhammad Ali, like nothing in the world could stop me; just like I have days where I can’t even comprehend seeing 30, and days where I can’t face up to life so I sleep for 18 hours. The people around you may like to give it large about how ‘damaged’ they are and how difficult it is to live, but that doesn’t mean you’re any less deserving of the help than they are.

Suicidal thoughts also take many forms. While some people may be capable of taking action with intent, it doesn’t mean that those who still experience thoughts like that but are ‘scared’ to take action are any less troubled by it. In fact, a lot of people spend months/years in that mindset before having the conviction to take action.

You’re doing the right thing going to therapy and taking your meds. Stick with it, and buy into it. And don’t let the fact that people around you are being more vocal with their problems make you feel like yours are invalid. Because they’re not. It’s different for everyone. If you want to chat to someone objective from your situation, feel free to send me a pm. Might not have the answers but I promise you I’ll listen. Stay strong."
"I'm the same way with how I see therapists. I'm also the same way in never asking for help. Though I've been referred so many times by my family doctor I went anyway but didn't have an open mind so I stopped.  


I think about it entirely differently now though. Therapists and psychiatrists are people too. Their job is also mentally straining, and they too deal with their own problems and many of the times see other professionals on the side. A relationship with them is in some sense a relationship with anyone else, there is a level of trust and a connection you can build. There is no doubt they have their liked and disliked patients. They may do it for money, sure, but they provide knowledge and medication other relationships can't.  


Speak to your family doctor or a counselor about it as if it's a normal thing. Tell them you're feeling uncomfortable and explain your symptoms. They may start you off with anti depressants before even referring you, which may work; if a few different types don't they'll most likely refer you to somebody. I know you don't want to ask for help, but nobody's going to do it for you, not because nobody cares but because nobody can know what you're going through except you. You have to do what's best for you and speak to a professional, at the very least for an opinion. I wish you the best of luck."
"I'm really sorry you're going through all of this. My anxiety wasn't nearly as bad but the things that really helped me are therapy, medication, and a book called Lost Connections by Johann Hair. This book changed my perspective on anxiety and depression. I used to think that it was all brain chemistry (and it is) but it talks about how it has a lot to do with your environment's effect on your brain chemistry.

That's awesome that you have a remote job though. Since reading that book, I've learned to value my relationships a lot more. Before I thought I didn't need to hang out with friends all of the time. I was texting with people occasionally and liking their Instagram posts so it's fine. But I was also getting a lot of anxiety. This wasn't the only cause (humans are complex) but it was one of the things that really helped once I changed my mind about it. Humans need community to be healthy so maybe try to find a little community you can join, even if it's group therapy or a hobby or something.

I know this may sound a little crazy. When I was in it, I was convinced that medications were the only solution. Something was wrong with my brain and I needed to fix it. And medication did help me out a lot! It gave me 5 months without anxiety to learn coping skills, see a therapist, move closer to friends and family, and do tons of research. Btw I started an Instagram to talk about what I learned and my experiences with anxiety and depression. If you're interested, it's @ouranimalbrains, I don't make any money off of it or anything, just thought I'd mention it :)

I hope this helps."
"There is described condition that exactly covers your situation - disorder of diminished motivation, or motivational deficit/deficuency, or a word i think is really apt, apathy. Apathy, not in the sense of lacking feeling, but lacking motivational energy.  Do a search for DDM or disorder of diminshed motivation.

 Another useful term that came from soldiers is  ""shell shock"".  It is different from PTSD, in that your are stunned into numbness, or the inputs are so strong and overpowering, your brain goes into static mode to protect you.  No OBVIOUS depression, anxiety or any such classics, but just stunned numbness.  Apathy can be clinical, as in everything about you is cleraly normal except you are ""socially"" absent.  While shell shock would be induced by overwhelming events.  I do not think shell shock fully covers this exactly, though apathy does.

One thing though: You maybe lableled as ""dimwitted"" by your people in your area, BUT that is fucking so much nonsense. You are very intelligent as is obvious from your real well though out post and your will to re-discover yourself.  So fuck society.  Indeed, some beleive ""that people (like you) often care, and that apathy is often the result of social systems actively obstructing engagement and involvement"". I think that an underlying physiological condition probably preexists and is just exacerbated by circumstance and life experience.

Yes, like what has been said in other comments CBT can help. LOW DOSE medication will help get you over the ""hump"" just enough for CBT to kick in. BUT i did read about your insurance being crappy.  And i think based on your input here you are totally capable of slowly fixing yourself.

This is quite a lot to think about.....so if you want you chat me up here or on whatsapp, or whatever, i will be happy to help you talk your stuff out.

"We are calling pediatrician in morning, and hopefully she can look into it more!  Prior to surgery I am sure he has had fleas jump on him, we have 3 cats and his grandparents have 5 dogs, so I am sure he's had a flea on him, but never has he even mentioned anything of the sort.  I actually had the same discussion about school with Mom about it, since she's been working this last week while I have been on vacation, she didn't think it was as bad as it is currently, she thought the way he acted today was a very sudden event, and if he is acting this obsessive over it, he wont be able to function at school... I had to let her know that he's been doing this all week, not nearly as bad, as it was just right after school, and went away fairly soon after, like he'd just ""forget"" about checking himself.  So she hasn't really seen it much at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Its driving me up the wall!  I tell him if a fly or beetle or flea or any little insect gets on him, it cant really hurt him... He says he knows, but continues to check... So i'd ask if your not afraid of them hurting, then why are you so determined to check and check and check? And his only reply is he doesn't like bugs...

&amp;#x200B;

With that morphine he was on, and how much he was itching, I honestly assumed maybe there was some lasting side affects to his nerves from morphine, to where he still feels an itch, and thinks that maybe the itch was a bug there, and maybe thats why he's so paranoid?  Mom says she believes anesthetics can take a little while to leave your system.

&amp;#x200B;

With the itch thought, I get itchy all the time, because i have dry skin, usually when the weather changes how its changing now and getting colder, maybe the dry skin is causing him to itch... But turning simple itches into constantly afraid of bugs might be on you, seems a bit far for me!"

I have no advice for you as far as how to get out cause I haven't gone out only dug deeper. Thoughts of suicide come frequent more and more everyday. I have no intention of doing it, but I know the more frequent they come the more I will consider it. The only times I have noticed when I don't fee the void is when I progress in *SOMETHING* doesn't have to be something big like all A's for grades but if I cook a dish I never had before, while that high only lasts for 20 minutes the void wasn't there. I've learned to accept failure as a part of life, I've failed at countless attempts at fitness, programming, tournaments, plans, scripts, videos, friendships, relationships, etc. I don't get back up and do it again cause this time ***I WILL SUCCEED***, I do it for the hope that maybe this time I'll follow through maybe *SOMETHING* triggers me in this attempt that didn't in the last. Nothing has triggered me yet, but I have feeling that something will; I guess you can call that hope? The only reason I go out is cause I know if I stayed inside nothing would change. Nothing has changed for me so far though. I'm still this emotionless skeleton of a human. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this void really has been pushing you to a point where you feel like you lost yourself or suicide and you see absolutely no way of getting out I recommend [therapy](https://www.rccd.edu/services/health/Pages/MentalHealth.aspx). I'm not just saying this cause it is what is always on those depression cards, I'm not just saying this cause I think you haven't been to therapy(I don't know if you have), I'm saying this cause I went to the one at my school and it was good help, we didn't have much time this session, but it was enough to identify my problems and categorizing what deep down I actual had problems with, as opposed to me generalizing  it with *depression.* I set up another appointment for next time. I mean if its free why not do it? 

&amp;#x200B;

People care about you and want to help, but none of us are trained professionals in doing this. We all have our fucked up habits and issues, don't feel as if telling your issues to someone is burdening their issues, for all we know what you   
 could be having issues and they might be going through the same thing. I'd say the hardest part about this whole thing is feeling alone, like this problem is only yours and yours to keep, but finding others with the same problems is some fucked up therapy in itself, it helps offer a viewpoint from the outside, a viewpoint many people might never see.

"Emotional hoarding isn't a thing, but rumination is. If I'm understanding you correctly, you are repeatedly going over your negative thoughts and the cause/ consequences of them. If so, that's rumination. It is associated with anxiety and depression and causes a negative feedback loop that increases your anxiety/depression."
"Hey. Fellow Impulse Control Disorder sufferer here too. I suffer from pyromania. I don't remember it being in my childhood, but it must have been buried because it is now coming out (thanks to a trigger) and it is quite an odd feeling. If you want to, you can message me anytime. I think I understand...at least I can listen."
"I don’t mind you saying I’m a shitty person, I’d call that a fair judgement. And yes, if possible I’d prefer to stop wanting to hurt others altogether. As far as apologizing, that would be disingenuous but I see where you’re coming from, I’ve considered it in my kinder moments but I suspect I’d just anger him."
I don’t think there is anything wrong with saying that at all. His behaviour has already been described so I don’t see any need in repeating it. Obviously only the boy knows exactly what is going on in his mind but to me his behaviour says I am in so much pain right now and I can’t cope on my own. Someone please help
"Nothing feels real anymore. I don't feel like I have any privacy. And I don't think anybody I meet is actually just a regular person.

Going to a doctor has helped some. He'll get you on prescribed medication which should help. But you need to see a therapist also. That way you can talk about these thoughts you are having.
"
"Sorry you are struggling.  But I'm glad you are in a caring relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut yourself some slack.  If your partner was struggling with similar feelings you would want them to feel better and you certainly wouldn't want them dead just because they feel like a screw up.  I'll be rooting for you to feel better."
Thank you for your very good advice. I am actually studying and intend to work for myself but it is another 2 years until I qualify. I think it is time I took a getting by job even though it will mean a pay cut. It worries me doing that - will it be worse? Will I earn enough to carry on my studies? But I need out. Thank you
"There is nothing that changes that man, and don't let a prom change your perception on someone and how you think about them, you can't dwell in regret for life man, life will take you further and this one event doesn't change your relationship with her, I wish you the best in life dude and don't let heartbreak, break you :)"
"Yes but it will take a lot of time and energy.

Ask people you truly trust and ask them to tell you things you have dine together or funny/shameful things you have done because they usually break the conversation and will lead it somewhere that youll remember.

Time is really the key to it stopping daydreaming may also help"
"You just gotta tell her you need help, 15 is too young for life to end, no matter the circumstances. Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It's going to be so hard to mention it, and you'll probably feel very ashamed when telling, but you have to somehow, and tell her you desperately need help. Maybe a note?"
"aww its so nice to see how many people have offered support to you so quickly after you posted this. You can message me if you feel ready to talk about what is triggering these feelings of self harm. Don't forget there are many people out there who are willing to listen and offer support, even to strangers! Take care &lt;3 "
"lmao you think watching videos of helpless puppies etc being tortured makes you a man or tough? news flash, it doesn’t. actual struggles in life do and actually facing your issues do, not watching fucked up videos and pretending you’re some kind of badass for watching helpless beings die or whatever, sort yourself out. "
"man how grateful i am to feel this connected to another human being, 
one going through similar feelings of comparing and feeling different from other people.

like for just this moment having experienced something meaningful and alright. like you talked about, ”making the suffering worthwhile”. 
thanks for sharing this"
"How do YOU feel about this aspect of yourself? Does it distress you? If so, change it. If not, don't.

It's not really up to us whether something is a problematic behavior. It's up to you. Because everyone's lives and experiences are different. If you have a lot of genuinely good people around you, being forgiving and trusting is a good thing. If you have snakes in your grass, then it'll be an issue and you'll get hurt.

I will say that it's very easy to be hurt and taken advantage of when you are very forgiving and slow to anger. But it can also be a very beautiful quality."
"I can say that I literally have had anxiety and depression from childhood. No (known) trauma and it has run in my family as far back as anyone can remember. I started taking an SSRI in high school and honestly wish I’d been saved my suffering until then. My child is showing symptoms (similar to mine as a child) and I’m not going to make him suffer like I did.  For me it has allowed a life without panic or fear of day to day life. The meds were the difference for me and without them I fear I would have been stifled by my fears, anxieties, and disconnection from my body.  "
"I enjoy hearing different culture perspectives (especially since I don't have $$ to travel). My reason for not always liking the ""how are you"" greeting question, probably largely stems from how it feels in the retail work environment, where it often feels more hollow. 
Among friends it's not so bad, though because I've been battling depression lately, I'm more hyper sensitive to it in general than I should be.

In Ireland, would people be weirded out if you happened to respond honestly if you weren't a-okay? Just curious. Some places see it as more of a faux pas than others."
"I'm just not sure why you are so fixated on placing blame on someone? Many people are dismissive and aren't even aware of it, I'm sure everyone's said to someone at some point ""Stop being (whatever; sad, mad, crying, upset, annoyed etc) "" with good intentions of hoping that person would stop feeling that way. Thats unawareness, its not malicious. So while I don't think being dismissive is a healthy response, blaming them would just compound the issue. Why not focus on educating them, and helping them foster empathy and learn appropriate ways to respond to a suicidal person ?"
"Same. 
I leave my phone charger in the living room so there's a reason to leave my bedroom. Though sometimes I don't care about it and stay in. 
It's the small things for me. When I start a small task it rolls into other ones sometimes. 
I also took the jump and talked to my boyfriend after months of not telling him. Felt so much better and he's been so supportive. I urge you to do the same. It helped me to write it all out cause I'm terrible talking about my feelings, I just go blank. 
You are not a burden, you are not alone, you are loved. 
I wish the best for you. ❤️ "
"Same. I don't even know HOW to approach my Psych with the issue I am having. I hope she names it for me (I need a professional to actually SAY it for some reason to validate what I already know?) and then I can heal--but on the other hand, I am scared to hear it because if she doesn't say it, things are just going to get harder because I can go on denying it. Does that make sense?

My one huge pet peeve is fake people. People who say I will be there and then snub you in your time of need. You don't need that kind of person in your life. I am here for you, and I mean that. :)"
"Something that really resounded with me was “my illness is not my fault, but my recovery is my responsibility.”

Being sick does not make you a victim. But you can choose to become a victim by not taking responsibility for doing the things you need to do to aid your recovery - seeking help, engaging with that help, taking care of your body, and so on - once you do those things, or even begin attempting them, just a little, you become a fighter, and a survivor.

You are not worthless. You are a human with value, even if you can’t see it right now. This I know for sure. "
"That my feelings of depression were valid, Even if they weren’t true. For example: I’m not a piece of shit. The depression is making me feel like that though, and it’s still okay to acknowledge and recognize my feelings. It really helped me come to terms with my depressive episodes but still let me have a realistic perspective on things. I was able to open up about my feelings more because I knew that even if they weren’t true, it didn’t mean I felt them any less. My therapist told my husband that too so he was able to become a better listener when I had bad days. "
"Well the thing is I never really said to the doctor I thought I was bipolar, I just told them a bit about my symptoms, I didn't want to blur their vision I guess.
 First one just sent me back after talking for 2 minutes. He told me to do yoga and try to do breathing exercices to get my head clear. That didn't work out of course.
 Then a few months ago I wanted to take an appointment with somebody whou could actually diagnose something, cause I know I aint right. They just refered me to a social worker. Although she helped me work on myself, I'm still my depressed messy self."
"You aren't worthless, and that might be that you don't have a job that you're happy in or doing what you would like to do. 
Shame with getting older is that we feel like we need to be young and energetic to start something we want to do now back then... This is the issue I am having is feeling it's too late and too difficult to get into what I want to do. Maybe this is the case, as we can only appreciate from a glance or we need to full steam figure out how to make the life we want for ourselves. It takes time, and it's about progression and maybe visualising that some how. "
"as i teen in the same postion as your daughter and maybe worse,i recommend just being supportive and i dont mean like what youve already done i want to say youve done an amazing job already.i mean support her wanting to stay home instead of trying to make her go out,if shes fine with going out with family when you ask take her out as a family more shell get more used to being outside and maybe invite her friends round for sleep overs more or let her go to sleepovers incourge her to go out but dont be pushy.

your doing great,just dont force her to do things she doesnt want. "
"Hey there. I'm sorry you had to live through that. I'm glad you survived.

One approach that works really well with therapists is to talk about how your symptoms feel, and the impact they're having on your life. When I went ""total honesty"" about things like blackouts, waking up with no idea where I am (without using substances), hearing voices, etc, my diagnosis followed pretty quickly. 

Most mental health practitioners do not want to write DID on your chart until they are absolutely sure. It can have long term consequences in many countries, especially the US. They know that, which is part of why getting the diagnosis can take time. It's more common to get the condition listed as PTSD or some other co-morbid disorder, that won't cause you problems. 

Find a specialist with experience in childhood trauma, if you can. 

&lt;3"
"I think this is fantastic advice. It’s right along the lines of what I came here to say. 

The only thing I would add is that I’m sure the friend might have some reluctance to leave the brother on his own in that environment but they should know that their mental health is the most important thing in a situation like this. They would find it more difficult to support their brother if they were to become more ill. Or to look at it more positively they would be better able to support their brother and actually provide him a safe space to escape to. 

And again I just want to restate how important OP’s position in this can be. If in her home life the friend is subjected to constant abuse then OP can help by doing something as small as providing an alternative narrative. It sounds like they’ve been a great friend so far. "
"I'm not sure how to go about that because our family isn't like that. Even my mom. It's so hard, like he said the voices outside are calling him a retarded cunt for example, and I told him well I don't think that about you and neither does anyone else close to you. You're not that. And he just goes well why do you need to say that ? Why do you need to tell me that. Like it's just a loophole, even nice things get turned around, he thinks we know who it is saying things about him. 
Also, my mom is the same way but she's not aggressive. But when he talks about the voices outside she goes on a rant about the people down the street, which I believe contributes to him thinking even MORE that there's people watching us.

Idk... It's so complicated. And I'm pretty much alone in this to try and help. Other people can only help so much"
"Do you have any diagnoses that you believe do qualify for disability? For reference: all the disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, have a huge range. I have friends with mild depression who just go for a walk every day, but I've been in and out of inpatient and doing several hours of therapy a week/taking multiple meds for nearly 10 years. I cannot work and cannot function a significant amount of time. I have a shot at disability, my friend does not, despite having the same diagnosis.

That being said - are these formal diagnoses you've been given? I only ask because comorbid depression and bipolar diagnoses are extremely uncommon - it's usually one or the other and they are medicated differently. Typically someone is diagnosed with depression and later the diagnosis is changed to BP once mania/hypomania presents.

Do you work? Have you worked? How often do you see treatment providers? Do you consider yourself disabled? 

Also know that in most cases the application takes 18 months-2 years and multiple appeals. So regardless it will be a while before you see a check."
"There was one character with autism who played an important role, mostly for his ability to understand patterns. I like that he was not portrayed as emotionless and incapable of affection. 


There are other characters with a range of mental diagnoses explicitly stated in the plot. One has tourettes. A few have PTSD of course, one is marked by a past suicide attempt. But I think all of these characters were written in a way that they were not at all reduced to their diagnoses and subsequent stereotypes.


Olivia Munn even had a line saying autism is recognized by some experts as not a disorder. I don't mean to get into that discussion here but I was very pleasantly surprised to see it even acknowledged in such a movie as this.


In another scene, someone uses the word ""retarded"" to describe the situation and other characters tell him to use another word and ""yeah show some some sensitivity, his *son's* retarded."" This line was obviously a particular brand of humor thrown in but again, I'm just glad to see the subject of person-centered language touched on, if only just barely."
"&gt;**Even when I open my eyes, it seems as if my room is getting larger (or zooming out) and I am not part of my self.**   

Princess, that sounds like ""dissociation,"" which at mild levels results in daydreaming.  Another example of mild dissociation -- which we all have experienced -- is suddenly realizing you cannot recall anything of the last ten miles you've been driving.  While your conscious mind was daydreaming a thousand miles away, your subconscious was driving you safely through three lighted intersections that you cannot consciously remember.

At stronger levels, dissociation can make you feel like you're outside your body looking at yourself in a movie -- or feel like you are ""not part of myself"" as you say.  Dissociation is one of the nine symptoms for BPD.  Specifically, that symptom is ""Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.""  See  [9 BPD Symptoms at Medscape](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/913575-overview).

I suggest that you ask your psychologist about the availability of a good DBT program in your area.  If he determines that you have strong BPD traits, the DBT program can teach you the emotional skills you never had a chance to learn in childhood.  Other good programs are CBT and TRP.  These programs can help you learn how to better regulate your own emotions."
"First of all, you’re totally allowed to vent on my post. It’s so nice to have someone who understands where I’m coming from, although at the same time it kinda sucks that you also experience these things. But yeah, that’s so much for your reply.

So this is a looong response which kinda goes off on tangents about myself, no hard feelings if you can’t be bothered to read the whole thing lol. 

Wow, I actually was reading that page you’ve linked just before I posted... huh. I certainly relate to a lot of those things mentioned in the article, but I think not to the extent that I would be classified as having that disorder - mostly because I don’t really avoid social situations as a result. I think a major problem I have is feeling trapped by the way I think people see me, as I usually fear acting in a way that is unexpected for the people I’m around. 

I’ve always had this, and one of the main ways I remember it manifesting as a kid is, for example, when my mum would be trying to remember the name of a character in a TV show she had been watching, and I knew what it was but pretended I didn’t bc I didn’t want her to think I was paying attention to her show?? It’s not like it was an inappropriate show, it just wasn’t a kids show, but I just really didn’t want her to think I was paying attention to it... I don’t know what that was about. But I have pretended not to know so many things like that over my life for the same reason. 

Anyway.

With the whole image thing - there are so many groups of people who see me as the quiet nice girl, and in those groups I really struggle to be anything but the quiet nice girl. I struggle so much to speak even though I know they would like me to speak, and I know it would benefit me to speak. I just don’t know what to say, and if I think of anything to say, I often overthink it until it’s too late and my chest feels tight...

This year, however, I started uni. I was very aware of this whole image problem I have, so I very deliberately tried to construct a cooler, more social image. I introduced myself to whoever I sat next to. I dressed in a less conventional and more ‘me’ style. I was added to a group chat for my course and I contributed a lot to it, even some totally bold stuff I wouldn’t usually say.  And it worked. I’m actually, I dare say, popular. (Although, I still feel that barrier is there stopping me from feeling like I’m in a proper comfortable friendship)

Yet, I still retreat right back into myself when I’m with my boyfriends friends, and feel nervous just thinking about being in a situation with any of them without my boyfriend being right there with me. It’s so frustrating, bc I know that it would benefit everyone including myself if I could be this new uni person around these people but i. just. can’t. If it weren’t for how close my boyfriend is to these people and how much I time I end up around them as a result I’d just give up on them and try and find a solid group at uni. Not because I don’t like them, but bc I feel so trapped in this stupid image.

I truly hope this situation gets easier for you. Its a shame about the gender thing, but I do think that attitudes are changing and it’s certainly becoming more acceptable for guys to have emotions and stuff and there are lots of people who not only wouldn’t be bothered by your feelings but would actually be glad to know that you aren’t all just tough guy, although it’s not quite there yet for everyone. I know I really need that emotional side in a partner, and it actually frustrates me sometimes that my boyfriend doesn’t seem to have any insecurities - I suppose I just wish him and I could relate to each other about that. 

So um, yeah. A stranger on reddit says they can relate to me and I open the floodgates to write about the hidden parts of my inner self for 30+ mins. Ha.

I just had an idea after posting this. That idea is that since I'm in a college pottery class right now for an associate of arts I could possibly go to my arts center and see if I could get hired there for some pottery related job. I already know the pottery teacher there and were friends so that would make it easier for me.
"I use “you” a lot, and the “shut the fuck up part” yes I do it a lot.

"Latuda is an anti-psychotic, but it’s sometimes used off label. I do not have psychosis/psychotic symptoms and I took it for awhile. If you want to know more specifically why they chose that med, it’s okay to call and ask. If you want to be more informed before you take it, that’s completely understandable. 

The worst thing that happened to me on Latuda was that I had a hard time sitting still or focusing. Everyone’s body reacts differently to meds, though, so your experience might be really different. The only way to really know how a med affects you is to take it. "
"Voices in your head hm? I might be losing my mind too.

I started doing memory games with myself. I listen to music. I make time to enjoy music and sing.

"Yes. Several. After the last job she lost, I was away on business and she went on a 3 day bender. I thought I’d come back to see her dead. 

I sent her home to be with her parents but she came back in a week. She promised me she wouldn’t drink or take drugs. I know she hasn’t drank but I know she abused cough medicine. 

This is a problem. I love her but she can’t keep a job. I know all she wants is to get married and be a stay at home mom. But in the 1 1/2 years we’ve been dating there have been many ups and downs and I’m not ready to ask her to get married yet. "
"You have a right to feel the way you do. It's natural to question everything when you lose someone you love. You may not feel normal but I thinkntjis is a normal way to feel. You have experienced something traumatic.

"You’re experiencing some of the symptoms of PTSD, namely hyper awareness and paranoia. PTSD is a condition that generally goes away with time given you’re back in a more stable environment. 

In other words, you experienced something very upsetting and you felt a loss of control over your life. Now you’re realizing that a mugging could happen anywhere, which is something you probably knew intellectually before, but now you have the emotional experience as well. Your mind is telling you not to go out, to be wary of everyone because you’re scared, and understandably so."
"Could you try seeing a dietician? I’ve historically had a hard time losing weight and after seeing a dietician I found out I wasn’t eating the right macros so I was making myself sick. Instead of eating healthier, I was eating smaller amounts of the unhealthy food I usually ate. 

After seeing the dietician I also stopped feeling guilty about eating because I was following a particular plan and eating less than I was supposed to was also bad. So as long as I followed the plan, I didn’t have any food guilt. It worked well, too! I was also pretty serious about exercise, and I lost about 37 pounds over 5 months. 

Since I’m not at my goal weight, she introduced a weekly “fun meal” so I have one meal a week where I can eat whatever I want without feeling guilty since the extra calories from it are already in the plan. "
"If you can't get your teachers or school counselor to help don't hesitate to also find a church. Many pastors are trained counselors outside of their religious training. You could likely find some help with your county DHS as well. You are still a minor so children and family services can help. I don't know where In Oklahoma you are, but if you are close, there may be resources in other states that someone in authority can help you get to.

Please, if you feel like you can't go on don't hesitate to just go to the emergency room. Insurance or not, they are required by law to treat you and maybe even step into your situation. Doctors are mandated reporters. They can help you.

And keep talking here, let us know you are ok. My heart hurts for you and i want to do all I can to help. I care what happens to you. Everyone here does. "
"You're very young. There is 0% possibility to predict now how your life will play out. Focus on the near future instead. 

Sounds like you could profit from CBT, you're obviously suffering because you're not living life how you want to. It can reduce social anxiety and give you a bit of self-worth back. Having a therapist who accepts you unconditionally can be a big crutch. 

What you can do yourself is to find something that interests you and get good at it. You're young, don't be afraid to start at 0 with something. Learn about computer security and become a hacker. Learn how to draw. Learn about the world and later travel a lot. Design and sew clothes. Pirate a DAW and compose music. Anything with a high skill ceiling. A mastered skill gives you a sense of progression and a more stable identity. Videogames don't count btw. "
That makes sense in my case. I've had some pretty traumatic years and I guess because after it was all done I maid it my mission to never feel like a victim again because I got myself in these situations because I thought I was living a misserable life even though I wasn't compared to what victomhood brought me too. I had so many days when out of no where I could be happy and in an instant was to kill myself. I guess after so much extreme emotions I can't feel anything anymore as a defensive mechanism. That's the diagnosis done with right there. I guess it doesn't really matter since I'm not willing to go through treatment again I'm only 15 and half of my life I've been going to therapy and feeling sorry for myself I can't do it anymore. Maybe not feeling isn't the worst thing for me idk... I feel more passive than I knew was possible. I don't feel depressed and I don't feel happy. I don't feel love and empathy but I don't feel hate either. It's a bit like taking medicine know that I think about it. Thanks for posting anyway your comment helped me see what the route of this is.
"we just spent the weekend together because his family was overseas and his mum wasn’t keen on him staying alone. Everything felt so normal yet so different at the same time which felt so weird to me. Hopefully the week apart that we’ve decided upon will help us and help me to forgive and bring the wall between us down. 

I’ve been wondering about this for a very long time.. and that is how do you know if you really love your gf? Is it purely the fact that you can’t live without your partner and she brings you joy? 

I’m questioning myself after this incident and am wondering if it’s due to familiarity or other factors thats why we are still together..
But at the same time, the past year that we’ve been together I’ve been so happy and my friends could tell that I’m happier ever since we got together. The thought of us going our separate ways instantly makes me cry but at the same time, my heart feels empty.. or different? I’m also unsure tbh. 
I’m not sure if I’m making any sense because my head is in a mess but I hope you get what I’m trying to say :( "

Blergh your post history is you just spamming the same videos all over.
Can you provide me with proof that it actually is a chemical imbalance?
Could also just be severe anxiety. I'd get checked out if you're able.
Doesn't change the fact that it will almost certainly skew the results
Go to a therapist. I think it could be borderline personality disorder.

Lots of things you can purchase can be used as a weapon. Even a weapon.
Never self-diagnose. Many symptoms overlap. See a psychiatrist please.
Obviously what I know is limited but it sure doesn't sound right to me.
Oh and incredible story. You are very brace and I'm glad you are okay.
"Ok, thanks. I understood only a part of that, but I know what you mean."
So inspired to hear you say this! I'm glad you decided to stick around!
Thanks for the help. I hope I can improve myself and follow your advice

"Being her friend is a great place to start. She may try to push you away, or ruin your friendship but be steadfast in your support of her recovery. Go with her to talk to an adult, you don't have to say anything, just be there. It is a very tough time being on someone's support system, be aware of yourself and your feelings. "
"Do it anyways. 

I get paralyzed by my thoughts a lot, whether they are depressive thoughts or anxious thoughts.

I can come up with a million reasons why I shouldn’t do things because of them 

But a therapist once told me to just radically decide to do things even though all my thoughts say otherwise. 

Best advice ever. "
"For me, I currently go to university, so I try to talk to people I normally don't speak with in class. Advice would be to know some basic things about you: favorite tv shows, foods you've tried from local places, things you like to do in free time. Those are the same things you'd ask the other person and extend a conversation"
"Hey, at least there's people here willing to say the truth like that! Never saw anyone talk about illnesses like those anything but negatively until recently.

"Hi thank you for the response.  I have tried getting another referral from the gp but they said to me they are only in touch with that specific resource centre so I tried getting a new psychiatrist but it didn’t really work. 
I do feel he doesn’t listen to me because of the diagnosis hence he eventually dropped me today. "
"I think I try my best to console people with mental health problems just because I can relate.

"I’ve been having this recently too. I have lost a few family members in recent years, including my father this month, and it makes it hard to not think about it. And then when I think about it I panic. Sometimes I can keep myself busy to avoid these thoughts, but when I start to feel relaxed it’s like they sneak up on me."
"Psychologists are expensive and typically covered by extended medical insurance with a hard cap. The normal (more effective) protocol is to visit a psychiatrist and psychologist if your symptoms are severe. Otherwise, you should maybe re-evaluate whether you really need to see a psychologist regularly or counsellor/therapist."
"Sometimes I need to touch something with a harsh texture when I start dissociating (velcro, my hairbrush bristles, a wall with textured paint).

"There actually exists some research on this very topic. Sleep deprivation lifts my mood too for a day or two, but it obviously has it's drawbacks. I've read something about reducing rem sleep to treat depression.

"Whether something is a disorder is contingent upon whether it has a negative impact on a person's life.  If not, then of course it's not a disorder.  How can something positive be a disorder?

"EMDR is evidence based, which means it has been shown to work, but it has also been shown that the eye movement part doesnt really add to its effectiveness. The part that helps is talking about it, working through the physical and emotional responses to the memory while the therapist guides some deep breathing or other relaxation/coping. Short of it is, if he has not told his therapist about the traumatic event, in detail, he hasn't worked through his trauma. This is what he needs to do, as uncomfortable as it will be the first couple times. This is the part that is effective."
"I agree with this. I swapped to eating more proteins, fruits, veggies, swap soda for water. Putting good things into your body will help you feel better on the outside. Not to say you cant eat anything else, just try to keep a balance. Dont overeat, but eat when you are hungry. Whether that's small meals/snacks periodically through the day, or two large meals. Whatever works your you to feel better. Maybe try antacids for the upset stomach. Might be a long shot, but I found out I'm slightly lactose intolerant my first year of college. And I cut back on dairy, just a thought. 
"
"I agree with you, but I’m confused as to why your classmate felt invalidated? 

I’m diagnosed borderline and have a history of self harm and suicidal idealization. I agree that mental illness is extremely romanticized. But nonetheless if I didn’t, I don’t see how feeling that way would invalidate me for struggling with a mental illness? I don’t know. I’m just confused.

I can actually think of something very specific that shows mental illness being romanticized. In the UK TV series, Skins, Season 4 Episode 5 is a clear example of mental illness being romanticized. "
"This might be random or something you might not want to hear, but one thing i’ve told myself for the past couple of years is if all else fails for me, I would devote my life to learning how to code. You can be a self taught software developer with a lot of time and practice and boy do they get paid a lot. You can learn to do it on any computer and there are many resources on the web that can guide you in the right direction. That would put you in a good financial situation, maybe move to an urban city, meet people and make connections. I truly hope it all works out for you! "
"A therapist who shared your core values would lose their license. That's my point. 

You have some very bizarre notions that are inconsistent with the mental health and social sciences. 

Unfortunately, conservatives these days often want to define special realities for themselves that match their preconceptions, which is pretty much what you're doing here. You're looking for a therapist to validate your viewpoints and you're unlikely to find one not merely because of education and empathy (though these are valid observations) but because they are not based in fact. 

""Consent is a bullshit concept"" is simply an ignorant statement. If I encountered a therapist who said that to me, I'd report them.

Maybe you should try the clergy at a very conservative church. In all honesty, you are much more likely to get what you seek there."
"Feeling that when you specifically see the sky? Yeah, that can be an agoraphobic symptom. Agoraphobia is the fear of situations in which you can't escape, be that escape from social ridicule or from things that could harm you. Now, keep in mind that I'm not a doctor or therapist, just someone who lives with agoraphobia, so my ""analysis"" is just coming from that. But it could be that when you get outside and see the sky, those thoughts are a reaction to feeling overwhelmed. So, you feel like you can't escape to safety (because it sounds like you're questioning the whole concept of safety), and that makes you panic. 

Again, that's just my two bits based on my experiences with agoraphobia. I'm sorry that you're experiencing this much anxiety, though. I hope you are able to find relief from your suffering sooner rather than later."
"I cannot diagnose you, but from experience this sounds like Pure obsessive OCD. I have OCD, but the subjects of my thoughts are different. Specifically I am afraid of being a pedophile and afraid that reality is not real (even though I know I'm not a pedophile and I know reality is real). 

The thing about OCD is that logical thought cannot counter it, and its very frustrating and terrifying. 

You would want to visit a psychiatrist for confirmation and a diagnosis and, if you are diagnosed, for medication.I am currently on 80mg of Prozac, and a high dosage is common for OCD and obsessive thoughts compared to pure depression. You would also want to see if you can find a CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) therapist, particularly one that specializes in ERP (Exposure Response Prevention). You'll get through this I promise. Its good that your mom is there for you and can give you access to hopefully good therapy.

I recommend this book as well, both for yourself and for your mom, it will give you an understanding into your intrusive thoughts. 

Good Luck and I hope you feel better."
"It's always sad to hear someone refusing to listen to the other side.

For the record I haven't done anything that my state or APA would consider unethical. None of these people are clients. Nobody has signed a treatment agreement. I'm not having a session with anyone, so I'm not barred by any professional restrictions. I'm offering my opinion, and backing it up with my professional background. I'm also offering a recommendation. Absolutely none of that is unethical, exactly how a doctor on the street can offer a recommendation. 

Besides that, you can make a solid argument that it would be unethical for me to NOT to offer a recommendation. Like you said, neither of us know if the husband is abusive. What if he is? What if my advice helps him find treatment? What if he gets better because I said all that? You can't know that's an impossible scenario. Does OP not have the autonomy to hear my opinion and do whatever she wants with it? Am I not allowed to back up my opinion with research and professional experience?

Stop backing up your opposing argument to mine with the false narrative that I'm unethical. It's bad arguing. Saying that the husband MIGHT be abusive based on my professional opinion is not inappropriate or unethical. I'm not forcing OP to do anything, and I'm not recommending her to MY specific work or anything else. "
"I don't mean to sound like I'm questioning the truth of what you said, but might I ask what lengths you've gone to to keep yourself occupied? If you're not content with yourself and spend a lot of time doing nothing (not saying you do) then it's only natural that you're going to crave the thing that you know will make you feel good and give you that sweet dopamine reward.

If you have a busy schedule full of activities that you really enjoy and engage in then you'll be able to pass a lot of time without even thinking about her or missing her. Once you have another source of joy, you'll stop feeling so dependent on your girlfriend to provide it.

So when you say that you've tried doing other activities, do you really mean you've chosen something and stuck to it? I would really recommend finding a sport that you enjoy and can do at least a couple of times a week. That's the ideal antidote to your issue in my opinion.

Finally, I would like to say something quite blunt but please understand that it is meant with compassion and also that it is just my personal perspective but, in my humble opinion, you will be more attractive to your girlfriend if you have a passion that is yours alone and doesn't involve her. It'll show her that you don't need her to be happy and that you can be independent. I find that kind of dependency inevitably becomes a burden the the other person. Having a hobby you care about will also give you something interesting and exciting to talk about with her. I look for this kind of thing in a SO. Your girlfriend may be different - you'd know better than I would. :)"
"Its about relationship. Some people like/relate better to young, some to old, some to male, some to female, but in my experience, the most important thing is that the person 'gets' you, and preferably 'gets' what you are going through. If they get both, then you have the potential for getting some really good results. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that you are the expert on you, and the therapist is just a consultant. They have their ideas about your life, but ultimately, you are the one who is living it, so if they are getting it wrong, its up to you to teach them how it is so they can get you moving forward. If you have tried this, and they are still not 'getting it' then its time to move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a personal thing, but I have seen a lot of therapists over the years, and have become pretty assertive with them now, because I am familiar with what works, and what does not work for me. So for example, if the therapist wants to ask me questions about something I am not interested in talking about, I might ask them why we are discussing that and if the answer does not make sense to me, I will ask to talk about something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not everyone's style, and I get that it may not work for some people. However, I find being assertive to keep things on track and helps to make the most of the time when I am there (not talking about irrelevant stuff, or 'filling the air' trying to get to a topic thats meaningful). 

&amp;#x200B;

All the best. Hope you find a good one. I definitely think its worth shopping around. You should know within a couple of sessions (sometimes just one) whether the person is right for you. On the first session it really should be a matter of both of you checking out each other, and figuring out if it will work. Lifes too short for shitty therapy - and there is a lot of it around IMO. "
"Happy to hear that. I wanted to copy and paste my most upvoted comment on how to take back our lives from mental health issues. There are a ton of links in r/conquertoday with other tools too. 

**YES to therapy.** All of it. And not just the stuff that gives you tools on how to manage your depression, but the deep, deep childhood Jungian stuff. If I didn’t learn why I was how I was, and then go through this year of anger and sadness, and then take the necessary steps to change what I needed to change, I would never get out of the pit. Good therapy is swimming through the river of sh\*t so you can get to the dry bank on the other side.

**YES to medication.** It’s a booster, it won’t change everything. You might have more luck with mood stabilizers instead of anti-depressants. And, we are currently in an anti-depressant epidemic, so that always felt a little more comfortable for me. But that is just ego, don’t let it get to you.

**YES to regimented sleep.** I mean this. You know the word lunacy or lunatic? It comes from luna, the moon. And it’s because during full moons when we didn’t have fully dark homes would keep people up, and it would trigger mania in bipolar. If I sleep 5 hours, I’m a wreck. If I sleep 9 hours, I’m a wreck. I need 7-8 like clockwork, and it seriously takes me from a 2/10 to a 7/10. Do whatever you can to manage this: yellow light glasses, sleeping medication (stay away from benzo/opioids), job changes, anything. The studies on this keep on coming. [Here's a full guide](https://conquer.today/how-to-wake-up-early-by-biohacking/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=biohacking+sleep&amp;utm_content=biohacking+sleep&amp;utm_term=no+zero+days) of what I do, I write about this stuff a lot.

**YES to exercise.** It works, it works, it works. Don’t do sh\*t you hate: if you hate running, lift. If you hate lifting, do yoga. Do it, celebrate every workout, breathe in the endorphin freedom. [You can start with literally one exercise](https://conquer.today/best-full-body-exercise/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=burpee&amp;utm_content=burpee&amp;utm_term=no+zero+days) and grow from there.

**YES to finding self responsibility.** You will never heal without it. I recently talked to a woman with a 35-year-old bipolar son living back at home. I told her, “Sorry mom. I know you want to love him, and I know he is in pain, but he will never heal if he is still under mom’s roof.” It’s just how male psychology works. I know you are female, but there are equivalents to this; such as you saying losing your partner would be the end of it. I am absolutely in LOVE with my current partner. I feel the same way. But technically, I do not NEED her. She doesn’t feed me, or pay my bills, or organize my hiking trips (now if I didn’t have those, that’s another story…). So you must find self-reliance. You can, and you will.

**YES to long term goals and short term habits.** This is called Kaizen. Your small victories are not working because they aren’t going anywhere. I know we are told to celebrate the showers and the little stuff, and sometimes that helps, but you need to celebrate the showers because that means you are one step closer to X. Being self-reliant. Volunteering for a cause. Travelling. Getting in great shape. Start with your values, create a self-mission statement, set five year goals, and break those all the way down to literally what you have to do TODAY to reach it. Write one sentence of a book. Do one pushup. Now these things have meaning. [This is the 5-1-30 method](https://conquer.today/to-do-list-exercise?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=to+do+list+exercise&amp;utm_content=to+do+list+exercise&amp;utm_term=no+zero+days) I designed to help you build this game plan.

**YES to sobriety.** I don’t drink or smoke and I’m very bored and it sucks. But I am stable. And I don’t have breakdowns. And I don’t have binges. And it is so, so much better. You’ll find a whole new world of health and friendships to explore.

Do not flail your fists violently at depression. It is a fog, it cannot be beat that way. You must be calm, collected, slow and steady. You must wake up to good music, cook a good breakfast, get out the door. Get out the door, every single day. Go to a coffee shop and read, whatever.

You must confront your ineffective thoughts with questions. Not “I’m NOT a terrible person!” but, “OK, sure brain, I’m a terrible person. Here, I’m going to get up right now and knock this person’s coffee out of their hand because I’m terrible. Wait, of course I’m not going to do that. Can I really be terrible? Hm…” [Try the rubber band challenge,](https://conquer.today/change-your-outlook-on-life-forever-with-7-days-and-a-rubber-band/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=rubber+band+challenge&amp;utm_content=rubber+band+challenge&amp;utm_term=no+zero+days) simple but effective.

**YES to trusting others.** Everything I just said above, depression has given you reasons and excuses why it will not work. I’ve been there. “That’s all great, but…” You are in the fog so you can’t SEE. We can see you, though. I can see you be happy, healthy, stable, strong. I can see you get down like we all do, but knowing how to manage it correctly and knowing it will end. Be well, I am here.

"Here is my opinion as someone that has fantastic financial success and career.  I am probably the saddest and most depressed that I have ever been.

So... I would honestly say that financial success does not lead to feelings of happiness.  While I am proud of my accomplishments and my career.  The value of those things mean so much less to me now and as the years go by because I have watched my predecessors retire and essentially be forgotten.

The value of your life is what you prescribe, its not the result of something.  It the choices you make and what you deem is valuable. "
"I very much disagree. Just because you don't have a specific behaviour/symptom, doesn't mean it's not a symptom of depression. People are different, not every depressed person has every symptom of depression.

It's not about excusing someone, it's simply that (to a huge extent) he simply can't change it.

The goal is to not even get into these arguments. This person needs therapy. 

And of course we should say to him when his behaviour is not OK. But either way, when you start arguing with someone depressed, you will fight, no matter who is right or wrong, even if his IQ is 200"
I've learned to revel in my loneliness. After years of losing relationships and friends I've just learned that the only person that's going to treat me the way I want and need to be treated is me. It's been a process that has taken me many years and a lot of nights crying uncontrollably but I'm here and I'm better for it. I occupy my time with things I enjoy and take deep breaths when my loneliness starts to get the best of me. It's not a perfect approach but what is amirite? I wish you the best and know you aren't alone in these thoughts and feelings. One day at a time friend.
"So I'm not bipolar but I asked my best friend. We would both agree that that's probably not your ideal dose or ideal meds. Perhaps you're on too high of a dose. My friend says it's normal for that to happen when your meds are changed, but that you shouldn't feel that emotionally drained for months. Def talk with your doctor! You'll know when you find the right meds. It takes trial and error with any psych meds for sure, but keep trying until you don't have that ""is something wrong???"" Feeling floating around. That's when you'll know that things are working just fine for you :) "
"You ARE loved, your baby loves you more than anything and you are SO important! 
I would go to a doctor and explain this. You aren't crazy. Like you said, this may just be a pile up of emotions and hormones or it might be something bigger. Best to see someone about it.

Personally, I am a manic depressive with bi-polar. When it hit hard, I felt the same way. I tried to pass it without medication but unfortunately, I literally need them and I know now that that isn't a bad thing. For a lot of people, this feeling does go away so hang in there girl! You are definitely not alone. "
"I agree that mindfulness is not for everyone. However, you’re making some sweeping generalizations here. I have anxiety and PTSD (among other things), and while I found mindfulness very difficult at first, it has become extremely helpful for me. There is also a lot of misinformation on what is/isn’t mindfulness - it’s not just sitting quietly trying not to think. It’s about engaging with something in the present, which for PTSD flashbacks can be hugely helpful. 

My story doesn’t mean mindfulness is good for everyone, but your story/articles don’t mean it’s bad for everyone. Each person has to figure out what’s right for you.

Also, you can find articles online that say anything is bad, if you try hard enough. I can find a credible article stating that I shouldn’t vaccinate my kids - but I think I will anyway. "
"Symptoms of euphoria or elation can be part of mental health conditions including bipolar and BPD, but they can also just be part of everyday life. If they come with restlessness and difficulty sleeping you should definitely go to a doctor because if you are hypomanic (a less intense form of bipolar mania) and not sleeping well it can develop into mania which is a serious medical condition that can require hospitalisation.  
  
For what it's worth, I've recently been diagnosed with BPD and have experienced the same feelings of euphoria and elation throughout my life. This past six months they have been more intense than ever and been accompanied by equally volatile downswings in mood. You should keep note of how you feel from day to day to shed the best possible light on your mental health – apps like daylio are good for this."
"A sociopath wouldn't be ""concerned"" with any of this, so clearly you aren't one. It's best not to jump at interpreting your emotional reactions because the interpretation itself will become the problem.

Not overreacting in stressful situations is a good thing, and you should be proud that you have this quality. But do not go into mental hypotheticals like ""I would not care I left my friends."" The concept of yourself that you form through these repeated daydreams can make your personality dull and destructive.

Your stoicism is as much a natural part of you as your hands and feet. Would it be useful for a person to think about the murders and mayhem he can commit with his hand because he *has* one?

Your hand is just *there* and there's no point in thinking about it. Your mind is just *there* and there's no point in thinking about it. Instead, take each day as it comes, and be happy that you posses the miracle of consciousness and don't cry about every little thing that happens like most people. 

Be compassionate and be a role model for others in that you're able to navigate the quirkiness of life in a calm and effective manner. Like hanging from a bridge, life is an inevitable trip to the crematorium. With the right perspective, even the most basic day-to-day activities can become a remarkable space of complete freedom and joy, knowing that it's all going to end eventually for you and everyone.

Check out this book by Alan Watts. Try to read it with an open mind. It's called *[The Wisdom of Insecurity](https://antilogicalism.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/wisdom-of-insecurity.pdf)*."
"OP, I think you've had a lot of knee-jerk responses to this from people who have been hurt by this kind of behaviour in the past. While I can certainly empathise with them, and you, I don't think anyone is actually answering you properly.

You seem to want a solution, not an excuse to end the relationship. It sounds like your partner is not very good at communicating his thoughts or feelings or being receptive to those of others. I'd suggest sitting down having an open and honest discussion about this with him, if you can. Not just to explain why it hurts you but also to hear why he chooses to say it. There could be any number of reasons and it's important to understand why so you can both move forward. 

As I've said elsewhere... If that fails, I suggest you try seeking a relationship counselor. I think these issues can be very difficult to resolve by untrained people so don't be disheartened if you struggle. I'm a professional psychologist and I have difficulties sometimes with having these discussions properly with my loved ones. It is not easy... And a neutral third party who is trained in these things can be very helpful. 

Beyond that, I think it would be inappropriate to give or take any further advice without more information about your circumstances... And I would caution against listening to anyone who offers any more than that. We don't know you or your partner. We cannot make a reasonable judgement in that position.

If you'd like any further advice about how to broach a discussion like the one I mentioned or... Any further questions, I'd be happy to do my best to help."
"Wow Oklahoma! Never been there. One way to try and discretely check if you have health insurance is maybe look in your moms wallet/purse to see if she has a health insurance card this card typically names the provider on it. However, I really think that (if you think it’s at all possible) you get your mom involved. You never know what she’ll say until you ask. Does your dad pay child support? If so maybe you could try to get your mom to use some of that to pay for you to go to the doctor. Your situation IS urgent and it sounds to me as if it’s life threatening and that is an emergency. 

Yeah what you’re saying about your dad makes sense and I understand how he could think that way. Unfortunately there are a lot of people that still believe in the (albeit very outdated) “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” method. They’ve been through worse and therefore others pain is not as valid. Your pain is just as valid as anyone else’s. Pain is pain the end. You deserve help. Absolutely no one should die by Suicide. Ever. It is a horrible, painful, and lonely way to go. I don’t want that for you and I hope you don’t want that for you. It’s great that you’ve admitted and recognize you need help, that takes a great deal insight, now the next step is getting the help. Is there anyone at your school you would feel comfortable talking with? It’s hard to fight for yourself when you’re this deep in depression and I understand that. 

Maybe keep look for someone that’s willing to get in your corner and fight with you. Just ask you never know. Remember Suicide achieves nothing except creating more pain in the world, it is not a solution, you will feel no relief because you won’t be alive to feel relief. I’m no medical professional at all this is just me telling you that Suicide is not and never will be a good choice. "
"I figure 12 years is my goal that's why I say that, but I've done so much stuff already. I do so much stuff for myself like meditating (it's really enjoyable try it, takes time to get used to) for an hour a day, working out (New deadlift 350 woot), studying useful skills like lockpicking and psychology as I said. I'm also currently in college, but I got a really good scholarship and I work often so I have a decent chunk of money for being fresh out of high school, but I have poor social skills. I also just get really bored of myself nowadays.

I just have a really weird and strong desire for it, that's another reason. I know it sounds a bit cheek but it's true. Plus I am certain I don't want to be an incel drag on society.

I'm also pretty sure that I messed up how I asked her out, because I put her on a pedestal metaphorically rather than myself, so I'm thinking that person is already uninterested. 

Side note, what do you think about forcing myself to take hour long cold showers every other week? I am currently doing it while fully clothed (obviously clothes I'm going to wash soon anyways) because it is supposed to help with reactions and it makes me more resistant to cold, problem is I enjoy being cold so im weird.

Just realized the way I wrote most of this makes me sound like C h a d w a r d e n, but I promise that's not the intention.

Maybe I'm finding a problem where there isn't one.

Now the tenth fucking paragraph I've added so much shit to this, at least I'm saying it ig. I struggle to be open around people, and by that I mean I instinctively act very awkward and reserved, which usually drives people away from me early and often, so I don't have many friends save for my one best friend.

L a s t l y, should I tell my friend about this or would I be just putting baggage on someone that shouldn't have to carry it? He's mostly been in the dark about any suicidal thoughts I've had, same goes for my family, but at least those were solved. And the reason I post here instead of just talking to someone is because people here are (generally) more helpful.

Thanks for responding :) "
"I have kind of the same problem...I can tell you my story.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 47 but my mind is stuck in my teen years. I even triggered a problem within me that is normally seen in young adults, not adults who are middle-aged. I think as a teenager, feel as a teenager, and act sometimes as a teenager would. When I was first married (I was 23) it was a HUGE shock, being so mentally immature, to be out on my own away from my mom (who had sheltered me waaaaaaaaay too much and never let me grow up) and have a house, job, responsibilities. Thank goodness we didn't have children at that time yet. That would have been disaster. Anyway, I ended up drinking myself into stupidity because I couldn't handle the stress of REAL LIFE. BUT...happy ending--Once I was out on my own for a while, it kept getting easier and easier to manage things. We lost our first home to foreclosure, but got an apartment for four years, which made it easier on us. My mom passed away and left me a good sum of money, and coincidentally, the lady in the house next door had also passed away and the family was selling the house! We were literally feet away and we jumped on it. We loved the house, bought it, and now we are homeowners again and doing MUCH better. Years on my own have helped me learn to cope with all sorts of situations. I am a recovering alcoholic (sober for 2 years now after relapsing over and over), I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and a history of Anorexia/Bulimia and self harming behaviors...and now I just got diagnosed with pyromania. That is the disorder I wrote about earlier. I am managing to live a normal life (well, besides wanting to set everything I see on fire ugh) and have a normal family. You can do that too. With therapy, you might be able to figure out why you're regressing. I think it is kind of normal at your age because I did the same thing. I just never ""grew out"" of my regression. I sure hope you can feel better and I hope things get better for you. I want my mommy sometimes too...but all my family is gone now. Good luck and you can message me anytime. :)"
Are you in the US?  I don’t have much to offer outside the US system :/
Are you looking for an actual service dog or an emotional support animal?

"Thank you for the reply, glad other people have kinda similar experiences"
That was months ago. It kind of triggered a bit of a breakdown you see...
This actually sounds like a good thing to talk about with your therapist.
"This and ""what's up?"" On a bad day can be the most irritating of things. "
"Unfortunately, punching and slamming things just doesn’t work for me.

"Yeep good luck, hopefully you'll find something worth doing a few times. "
You need to be completely honest with any therapist for anything to work.
"is it rape if she likes you though? kiddin
and...10x though i hate bdsm. "
maybe you should learn to program or something else you can do remotely.
Could try some meditation. I’m not a dedicated practitioner but it has helped me dipping into it a few times in my life. It lets you take a step back and calm your thoughts. Seems like you already have some awareness of your thought processes because you can see you don’t like them. Maybe some people don’t even have that.
"I also accept my mental illness at this point in my life because I know it will be there, regardless of the medications I take or the therapists I see. I will always have to manage it. But I think looking back, I also romanticize it as part of my identity because it was such a huge part of my life, especially in my teen years. "
"I don't really know, i just feel like if i weren't so horrible then people would treat me differently, like they'd actually talk to me when i need someone to listen to me and act like they care instead of just *say that they do*. and i also feel like if i weren't a horrible person, i wouldn't be here criticizing myself so much."
"I dont know how to say this, I'm just so unhappy, I dont know if I'm stable enough to live on my own and keep a full time job, maybe going back to school part time will work... I'm recovering from an attempted suicide 4 months ago and today is my 6th day not drinking... but I dont think anyone nor myself takes this seriously..."
"I'm sure you would be there for them during a crisis. You probably don't care to think about them

Just read your post. Yes that’s the worst! It’s the last thing on your mind when it isn’t an issue but when it starts acting up it totally consumes everything! Thank you so much. It’s nice to just be able to get my feelings out and know I’m not alone. I’m also here for you. I’m a good listener if you ever need one
"My life long struggle, so totally interested in responses to this also.

I found that being focused on something helps keep my mind off it, so I guess being focused is the ultimate escape from your mind.

Sadly I drive alone for 10 hours a day, so this gets difficult at times, so totally interested to hear proper solutions haha"
"Thank you. I have too much time on my hands and I don't want to do anything else...all my interests are just blah to me now. I really have it bad for fire...geez I am like an obsessive lover or something. That is all I want right now. I think I will ""burn"" off some of this tension. I have no choice...

Thank you for the hug. :)"
"Well, I have something that is actually Impulse Control Disorder, but in a way it is VERY closeley related to OCD. I have an obsession...and I have the strong compulsions that are actually irresistable at times to do what I do. It cycles all day long. I don't know if this helps...but you can message me if you need anymore info."
"Yes, if circumstances were different, we wouldn’t be depressed at all. Sometimes I feel we are just the unlucky ones. Born into dysfunctional families, not having the right head start in life, etc. But things can change. It’d just be a harder life than most people. Don’t blame yourself. That’s what I always tell myself."
"Your ""calm"" state sounds a lot like what I call ""numb""; like a very flat emotional state. Stressed and fearful sounds a lot like anxiety. I have a lot of those when I'm at a really low ebb.

At my worst I got diagnosed with dysthymia (now called Persistent Depressive Disorder?) and social anxiety (possibly generalised anxiety)."
"I went to see a psychiatrist but then because I change doctors surgeries they moved my mental health team and they stopped the psychological therapies and it sucked. 
Honestly the best help I’ve had through mental health services was going into a psychiatric ward. They actually treat you as a person, and go through care plans and crisis plans with you for while your there. I’m just glad I’m in the UK and don’t have to pay for it, although I’ve been tempted to go private because the NHS are garbage but can’t because I have a long standing mental health diagnosis now. "
"I’m not from your area so I don’t know anything about specific facilities but I will say this: be careful reading online reviews, because people who leave them are disproportionately those who were unhappy with their experience. People who were happy with their care are much less likely to leave reviews. I spent several months in an incredible facility, with great staff, great programming, and which helped me immensely - but reading facebook or google reviews you would think it was the worst place ever. I don’t know if that’s helpful, but maybe something to think about. "
That is true. I have been working hard to better myself and make changes over the last couple years. And I have been somewhat successful as well. So far it has not clicked and internally I don't feel any accomplishment joy or confidence anymore so then I have always. But there are moments when I feel some slight sense of meaning. At least enough to not mind feeling ok about where I am and not beat myself up and feel guilty for a few minutes. So if that's what it takes and it will be a long process before I can pat myself on the back and feel more confident then so be it I guess.
"Try to take them with a grain of salt, if you can. There are plenty of criticisms around the field of personality inventories, never mind self-administered tests. 

However, I would say it sounds like you're quite critical of yourself in general, so you're answers may not be super accurate! And you don't seem disagreeable on here. However, even if you were all those things, there is value in that. Disagreeable people tend to be more honest, people who aren't conscientious can be more exciting, neurotic people are often very sensitive. There's value in you, no matter who you are."
"Generally speaking seasonal changes are hard and if there is especially going to be several days of rain or snow.

Another odd feeling is that I'm sometimes forced to sleep right before a storm of I'm sitting at home. Can't keep my eyes open no matter how hard I try I just slump over. If I'm up and active at work I'll crash to a snail's place, need to sit down and and just space out (very bad for my job). As soon as 10-30 min after the rain starts I'm usually fine. 

It's hard to remember during these times that I don't always feel this way.

Boosted on vitamin D and Iron supplements, eat very healthy with enough protein, lots of exercise. Relatively caffeine dependant but coffee hardly takes the edge off. I had occasional migraines during season changes and caffeine seems to open the constricting ventricles to stop the headache."
"I'm an actual mental health therapist, and my advice to you is to be completely honest with yourself and your therapist.  If your therapist teaches you coping skills or provides you with a new idea/approach to a problem, and you disagree or do not believe it will work, say something.  If you think the therapist talks too much or does not provide enough feedback, tell them.  If you are not sure if you and the therapist are a good fit for each other, also be open about that.  Furthermore, just attending the appointments is not enough.  You must think about the sessions between sessions, try to make connections for yourself, practice the skills taught, and consider what you want to talk about before your next session starts.  Therapy is a collaborative experience, and you both must put some work in so that you may benefit from it.  "
"I'm wondering whether your mental health has gotten worse because of your job, or whether you think your mental health has impacted your ability to do your job?

if it's the former, get a new job; maybe part-time. you can't be blamed for a crap workplace. In addition, a job where you feel safe and supported will probably increase your overall mental health instead of sending it on a downwards spiral.

if its the latter - look into getting mental health support and maybe taking a break. You might need to disclose what's going on to your manager (if you feel comfortable) and that might provide some relief for the both of you. Otherwise, just continue to look for new job - people don't realize how much mental health can be impacted by our work environment. I learned this firsthand. Your mental health is more important than any job. "
"I feel unstable and stable at the same time. I feel normal and crazy. I went through quite a bit of ""treatment"" in my life. I've been in a mental health boarding school that was my lowest low I was a complete junkie and utterly depressed. But then somehow I got home and got accepted to a nice school and I made some nice friends and I stopped doing drugs completely and I stopped feeling sorry for myself because I finally saw that people have it worse. I had it worse for a while. I got on the right track and studied hard but I got into so much shit with social services that everyone except for my close friends treated me like I was fucked up. I had my court date and now I have drug testing and therapy twice a week. I'm just trying to understand how long I've been faking emotions. What I really want to do is smoke all day and trip out. But I can't because they'll catch me and I'll go back to a place like where I was I am never going back there. But it was a different me that feared getting busted and that worked hard to stay home. But now I'm only acting on traces of a feeling or instinct. It's been almost a year since I came home and I don't feel depressed but there must still be something wrong with me. I will never talk to my therapist I don't trust here I've been to too many and they don't help. Pills help for a while but you have to live with it. I was feeling horrible shame and guilt for things I did in my past. Constantly flashing back and feeling horrible. I didn't sleep for months. But time heals everything and I'm getting better by the day but now I don't feel anything. Fuck "
"Suicidal ideation is on a spectrum. Understand that most people with mental illness have suicidal thoughts at some time, some constantly. When someone shares with you that they have suicidal thoughts, THANK THEM for sharing, and take this as a sign that they are having serious issues and need some help. Ask how you can help. But don't assume that having suicidal thoughts or having had them in the past is an indicator that someone is going to act on it in the short term. Many people with mental illness and suicidal ideation are able to get through their days without acting on these urges. It's an irrational thought pattern that they can talk themselves out of. I feel 100% confident that I will never kill myself despite feeling 100% confident I would at prior points in my life, because I know that's not my path.

&amp;#x200B;

As I've worked on being more open about my mental illness, people get really afraid at the mention of suicidal ideation. I've struggled to get people to take my depression and anxiety seriously because I've mostly kept it internal, and have developed a lot of habits to mask it. As I began to open up more, one of the things I found was that it took mentioning suicidal ideation for people to really take my mental illness seriously. I had to qualify it with a shock-factor. I mentioned it to just give a realistic assessment of what I experience, and others have obsessively latched onto that fact and think I'm going to kill myself. No, I'm just depressed. And I have PASSIVE suicidal ideation. That's different then a plan and intent to act.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, I just wish there wasn't so much stigma around the topic of suicide. The reality is I think most people contemplate it situationally at some point in their life, and others struggle with it constantly. Suicide is serious, yes, and should be taken seriously. I just wish people weren't so afraid about accepting that the vast majority of instances of suicidal ideation do not lead to executing a plan. I wish more people could see suicidal ideation as an INDICATOR of the severity of mental illness, but not always an indicator of real imminent risk. I feel like people baby me and others and tip-toe around the topic, when really the true level of risk could be assessed by asking ""is it passive or active?"" before jumping into how they think they can be supportive."

"All the more reason to see a doctor. For one, you could be misdiagnosed! Having a persistent psychiatric symptom both pre &amp; post meds sounds like the actual problem isn't being addressed. A small amount of disorientation is normal with many common conditions, but to the extent that you describe requires further investigation"
"Don't inflict your will upon her or try to ""fix"" her.  Just listen to her.  Don't offer advice unless she asks for it.  Don't react to her in negative ways and instead focus on being understanding.  Now is not the time to solve relationship issues.  Stay with her and make sure she is safe depending on the extent of her episodes."
"I think it's a bit of both. My mental health wasn't the greatest coming into this, but I was hopeful and willing to learn. Due to somethings out of my control, it became increasingly difficult to actually care anymore. 

I honestly wish they would fire me. I am looking for a new job currently but I deff need a break in between. "
"I’m borderline as well, this is how I look at things.

"I’m not sure if you’ve ever had vitamin levels checked but it may be worth looking into. If you’re deficient in some things it can really mess up your memory!

Just from that one comment alone that her mother was probably a narcissist and probably part of the reason why this poor woman had so much emotional trauma that she just couldn’t handle it anymore. My heart hurts for her and her children that will now have to grow up without her. Her “mother” is a horrible horrible person.
"Okay, let me put it this way. 
If the people you're aspiring to hang out with and get respect from instantly value your contributions less when they find out that you're 19 they're not the most mature crowd either. If it's that big of a deal, just tell people that you're 20. It sounds like you're overthinking things here though."
Still ask. Ask as many therapists as you can and see what you can get. At the very least you can get an idea of what you need at a bare minimum to start working towards that. You may have pushed yourself into a corner but there are ways out. It may not be easy but it's possible and you owe it to yourself to explore every option.
"Then it’s completely up to you. Despite what society says, we don’t have an obligation to our parents. It does sound to me like he’s trying, but I don’t know him or how he’s treated you in the past. If you think a relationship with him will affect you negatively, then you don’t have to put an effort into having one. "
"Yeah, that’s another problem, but I work with a lot of women - many of whom are mothers (although within 5+ years of me). She absolutely could be my mother, though, given our age difference, now that I think of it. But why her? she is one out of several mothers around her age with whom I work. She’s the only problem for me. "
"I didn't have any sort of formal follow up (just with my own psychiatrist after) so I don't know exactly how that goes.

BUT

 * you self admitted when you felt like you needed help
 * you're taking your meds
 * you're going to the followup appointment like you're supposed to

Generally speaking, beds are at a premium and are given to people that are either an immediate danger to themselves or need care but aren't able to do it themselves. You're doing everything right and don't fall into either of those categories so its pretty unlikely they'd want to rehospitalize you right now"
"I think this is the best response. They are trained to be ""on duty"" and 100% certified that they can behave in an indoor environment and not get distracted by anything or anyone. That's why you are not supposed to pet Service Dogs, like the K-9 unit ones. They are working. 

An ESA helps you but their behavior is the one of any other dog in general/broad terms, and places don't want to legally be liable for what the doggie might do while in their place. 

I know it sucks but it is a good reason :/  I want a therapy dog myself, but I don't have the place/time for a dog right now. "
"Thank you, this will give me some lead. The changes aren't dramatic. But the ""middle level"" state of mind is changing while my ""base level"" notice the change. These different levels of mine is similar to having different people inside my mind. As far as I understand, one is Rational, One is absolute soft and kind and one is cold and have a will to kill for own good.
I had no idea when I noticed this. According to internet, I have depression, anxiety and binomial.
Also a weird thing. I have really good gut. If I go against my gut, bad things can happen but generally minor issues.

"What country are you from? Here in the UK, GPs tend to rush appointments because they only have 10 minutes to work with, so it's common for them to prescribe meds since it's quicker than sending a referral. I find it weird that she prescribed the meds when you specifically asked for therapy though. She might have done it because therapy could have a long waiting list, but she should have discussed that with you. Is it possible to get another appointment (either with the same doctor or a different one) to discuss your concerns? You shouldn't have to take meds if you don't want to."
"Younger women often like older men.
Older men are confident, successful and they know what they want in life.

The cutting yourself could simply be you making this man stay with you, a subconscious lack of self esteem. If this translates into reality it is a problem.

For some people this level of older guy fetish can be as a result of losing a father or having a father who wasn't the best father, for others it can simply be the older guy fetish.

As I got older I started to get hit on by teens and young women in their 20s. The fantasy is very common amongst my girlfriend's too.
"
"You ask a very good question. In my case, there is no cure. However, that does not mean my life is hopeless and I'm doomed to suffer every moment until I die a horrible death. Instead, I think I'm being far more realistic and not setting up myself for failure by holding unrealistic expectations.

I'm diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Unfortunately, I can't undo the events that took place, bring back the people who died, and erase the immense suffering that's occurred. 

The reality of my situation is I need my medications to keep me healthy. I've benefited greatly from it along with therapy. My symptoms return if I'm off my medicine, and it's not pretty to watch. 

I read it often online that there is no cure, but one can only manage it. I feel like my own situation is someplace in the middle of both ends. I'm not 100% cured and perfect, but I have made a lot of progress, thanks to my therapists and psychiatrists. Maybe I'm taking it wrong, but ""just managing"" to me doesn't seem strong or accurate enough to describe where I am in my life. I could be wrong though!"
"Did you actually get diagnosed with DID? Are you prescribed meds? I ask this to ensure you are not self diagnosing yourself and are not using your behaviors as a way to justify your actions. You ""freaking out"" when he doesn't text back when you want is not you turning into a different person/identity....That is simply you being impatient and allowing your thoughts to run wild. Do you trust him? Do you believe he has your best interest at heart? Yes? Ok then....30 minutes of waiting for a response shouldn't be to much to ask for. It's alright... I use to have a friend who would get mad when her boyfriend never replied within 1 minute of her text...but she had no problem reading his texts and not responding for hours. Character goes a long way. Behave how you want people to behave towards you and you'll get more out of life.If you had friends that abandoned you and you now have new friends...don't put that weight on the new ones. They didn't leave you....YET! But you keep giving them reason to and they will, like all the others...Subconsciously you probably want to test your new friend(s) to see how bad you can get before they throw in the towel...Trust me...This test is unnecessary because you already know the answer. THEY WILL LEAVE YOU TOO. Just try your best to stay calm, be yourself, and enjoy the CURRENT friendships you still have, because if you don't play your cards right, one day you'll be alone with those 5 personalities you say you have.

"Thank you for the answer. This is actually super helpful. I fell in love with him because he was the first guy to be patient and caring for me. I used to be so shy and nervous and I didnt have any other friends at the time. We were both college drop outs so both of us had kinda isolated ourselves from others and clung to each other. After awhile we both started being being ourselves more around each other and thats when both of us started to display toxic behaviour. For example im already an extremely clingy person so honestly kinda went along with his toxic behaviour by giving all my attention to him and doing as he said. In my past relationship I remember hating the feeling of having no control over my partner and was constantly terrified they would leave me so honestly displayed somewhat similar reactions to what my boyfriend is displaying with me so I guess i kinda empathise with him? I guess I take his behaviour as he just loves me and is scared ill leave. I hate constantly fearing being abandoned or replaced more than the feeling of potentially upsetting him over something small and only having to deal with that for a few hours. 

I do think he realises his actions now after me having multiple panic attacks and getting pretty depressed. Even myself making the situation worse by actively avoiding people just to prove that im not bullshitting when I say I love him. I maybe have something wrong with me because I honestly felt okay with doing as he said. Even going further just to prove that I am loyal. He now says im allowed to have friends and to do certain things and he has no right to have that much control over me. He says he feels terrible after I broke the other day and he told me to be completely honest about how I felt and I said I no longer feel like his equal and dont feel like his girlfriend and rather some kind of pet or doll to him. I think he is honestly trying to change but its hard for him. Hes made it very clear that im okay  to do as I please but will still get upset when I talk about hanging out with other people or talking to friends online. Im happy to be with him if he does try change and realise his actions and work through them. Even work on myself and stop being so passive and letting him control me. Im trying very hard to work on myself and as long as he does the same im more than happy to be there for him. "
"Thanks for sharing man I know it’s hard. Your story touched me because I can relate. I have been there myself. For a long time I was very codependent in relatives too and never thought I’d get a job and was terrified of it but I came to a point where I just told myself look you’re better than this and deserve better and I just got very proactive and looked for jobs I knew I would be a good fit at. Just figure out what your skills are and interests are and what you’re good at and do specific job searches for that! Keep at it and I promise you will find something! No job will be a utopia, but try and find something that you feel good about and that you feel pretty sure you can do and earn a paycheck, set manageable goals and maybe once you have gotten some kind of a job and build your confidence, you will learn what your passions are and you can move on to something you love doing! Or maybe you already know what that is! When you do find a job, it will seem scary but you just have to believe in yourself believe me when I first got a job it was at a call center and I sucked at it and quit but I kept at it looking for other jobs on the job search engines and craigslist. I finally found the job I have now and like it it’s given me good work experience. I don’t yet make enough to live on my own but it’s a stepping stone. I have depression and anxiety too although mine is more depression and I have borderline personality disorder. That is awesome that you are working out, that takes a lot of courage to do! That tells me you have grit and determination inside. This is something I’m wanting to do too but I’m self conscious and scared to go to a gym because I feel like the skinny dude. I’m working on it though. You are lucky to have your grandparents I know sometimes in a situation like that it can seem like they are talking down to you or don’t understand but they just want the best for you in their own ways. Mental illness is hard for some people to grasp but I’m sure they love you a lot. You seem very articulate and intelligent. I was in a similar situation for awhile I had no job and was living with relatives and felt guilty and useless because I wasn’t earning my own living but I promise if you don’t give up and keep at it things will get better. Never be afraid to seek out local resources for assisting people find jobs like vocational rehabilitation or something like that too. Main thing is just believe in yourself and recognize your own strength and what you have to offer! I know it’s hard sometimes and really scary and medications can suck trust me I’ve gone through a ton of them too. Just keep at it until you find something that works and always try and focus on the positive things and what you have to offer and take things one thing at a time! Keep at it and stay determined and don’t give up on yourself! "
Forgive them. Being able to forgive grants you power beyond what is normal.
Great post. this is so true. all of it. its a daily grind. but. we. do. it.

I've found that listening to music and building playlists can really help.
It makes me sad to read this and I wish I could help. Please don't give up.

It’s hard. You’ll feel emotionally exhausted the remainder of the day.
Lmao no sympathy? because I’m letting this girl know this dude is toxic?
Maybe try to do one thing in your list once a week  and see if that helps.
Thank you all the way from New Zealand. You have really helped me today :)
Thank you so much for the thoughtful response. I’ll check them both out.
Thank you. I think I am going to make  appointment with my doctor tomorrow.
"don't give up on her. Make her feel your presence , understanding and love "
"But you'll never improve if you go that way, my goal is to improve in the first place, I need to think strategically to increase my winning chances otherwise well.. all my victories would be up to chance, which would make them feel empty and pointless and make me feel even more defeated, I need to think strategically I *have* to."
"From what I've heard, you get better at recognising what is real and what's a hallucination, I've also heard that you shouldn't question them and just pretend that they are normal and supposedly the hallucinations get less aggressive or invasive. That's only what I've heard from others as I have no personal experience with them. "
"I feel the same way. I haven’t been excited for anything for years now, and that special giddy feeling you might get when you see your crush, or think about how fun the weekend is gonna be, or just feel happy, it doesn’t really happen anymore. I bounce between lows and nothing at all, it’s hell really and I can’t get out."
"I think recently they implemented a rule where you cant tell someone not to do it unless you give some actual tips on their problem.

I agree that it is annoying to see the ""I just got rejected and now I want to die"" posts, but there are more genuine ones there too. 

Sometimes unloading your problems is the only want to fix them"
"I was serious. That is what I see. I see everything on fire, burning literally. I feel euphoric when I see the flames, happy, satisfied, and excited as hell.

I would say though, most of the time, I just see the world. I don't feel anything a lot of the time...just numbed out. I laugh and joke with the kids, but I don't feel it. "
"I'm a cop. Don't do this. Taking someones life stays with you forever. I'm 23. If I had to kill someone, I'd live with that forever. Not to mention now days, they'd be dragged through the mud like they're the bad guy. Their families would be constantly harrassed. All while being placed on leave and believing they're the bad guy. "
"I'm in Ontario. Mine costs $110 for 55minutes. 
Insurance is covering the first 5, after that it's out of pocket. 

Hoping to get enough out of it until I can't afford it anymore. I'm on the waitlist for public, but it's around 18 months in my area. 

Do you specifically need a psychologist? Or could you go to a psychotherapist? "
"My family saying that going to therapy will get you committed and put a red flag on you the rest of your life and you'll never get a job. Funny, cause I've been going to therapy the past 3 years weekly and I've managed to keep it from them and everyone else....pure ignorance. Their idea of mental health is stuck in the dark ages."
"Oh shit..honestly the main reason why I wanted to quit was because I realized how annoying I was becoming to my boyfriend. At the end of summer I just went crazy on drinking. I used to get upset over the littlest things, I still feel bad he saw me in that position. I’m sorry you’re going through that, I hope he realizes soon "
"Thank you!  Thank you so much. I will definitely try white noise.   She is herself when nobody is yelling or fighting in a language she doesn't understand.   I am kind of relieved and feeling a little weight off my chest that she's not having hallucinations.
I had hypnagogic hallucinations in the past and they were terrifying. 

"
"The receptionist is probably some kind of health care professional, maybe a nurse. They definitely are under the same confidentiality rules as your doctor.

Do you have a clear idea of what the doctor can do to help you? I would probably mention the problem very briefly and then say what you would like to discuss with the doctor."
"Do you think its more of a medical condition, or youre simply going through some life crisis? It may not be a bad thing, maybe you've (subconsciously) realized that you've been putting on an act around people in order to get accepted, it was never really you to begin with... but now you're trying to find out the real you, hence all this confusion. I think this is actually a normal process people experience at some point in life. Take this opportunity to dig deep and be honest with yourself. Therapy can help speed up the process too, it made me more certain of who i am as a person "
"I also feel this!!! So much. And for me, there's something especially jarring about the transition from summer to fall. I'm a very nostalgic person (just turned 21) and I feel like I'm in this weird transition stage in my life. I graduated from university, so this was the first fall that I haven't gone back to school, which for me has evoked feelings and memories about previous years. I also feel very negative about it, and experience is around this time of year every year. 

I have no idea what it means, but at least we're not alone in experiencing it. I wonder how common it is. "
I've been where you are. It takes time. It also takes a loving partner who understands. Every time I would get jealous I would remind myself that my husband is going nowhere. He loves me for me. I found it hard to believe that my husband would choose me over better looking women. I had to remind myself that he chose me. I had to also learn to love myself enough to know there is no reason to be jealous. My ex divorced me because I was gaining too much weight. That scarred me and sent my trust level to zero. It took a while but I am at a point where it takes alot to make me jealous
"On the day I turned 59 years old  I was 85kg (151cm!) I determined that on my 60th birthday I would be 57kg and, would not enter my coming years overweight and unhealthy besides being uncomfortable. It was as simple as only eating or drinking nutrient rich food. I also walked 4 times a week. I was able to organise a fabulous 'reli bash' in a beautiful park for my 60th birthday. I had reached my goal weight and remain 57 kg 8 years later. Keep it simple - it didn't cost me a cent. I urge you to not overthink it thereby getting upset &amp; despairing. One hour at a time. Good luck

"
"Thanks for your reply, It’s comforting to know that I’m essentially not alone. I’ll cautiously explore my options in terms of doctors in my area. I don’t want to resign myself to professional help so quickly; I’m afraid it might lead to me overthinking my situation, and having the doctor exploit my situation for money.

I’ll be sure to look into the texts you’ve mentioned, and possibly other similar stuff. I’m quite sure they’ll double as good reads as well. Hopefully I’m able to find solace in them and avoid seeking professional help altogether. Thanks again!!"
"You’re right. I’m assuming that in this scenario, OP’s wife is going willingly. Even if someone WANTS to be admitted, and thinks it would be best for them, in many places, such as where I live, they still will not be admitted because there are too few beds to give one to someone who is not an immediate risk to themselves. An acute psychiatric unit is for those who are a risk to themselves (or others). 

You are correct, however, that a person who is not an imminent danger cannot be forcibly committed, by a family member, doctor, hospital, etc. They have the right to refuse. "
"As a therapist it's completely necessary to take regular stock of my own mental/emotional health.  I have a ton of coping skills I alternate between depending on what I need and what's convenient.  Here's just a few:

* 1.  Playing guitar/singing
* 2.  Cooking
* 3.  Video games
* 4.  Writing/blogging
* 5.  Playing D&amp;D w/ friends
* 6.  Talking it out with my wife.
* 7.  Listening to music
* 8.  Reading fiction
* 9.  Taking a very long very hot shower
* 10.  Playing with or cuddling my cat


I've been diagnosed with ADHD.  I went undiagnosed and untreated (medically) until I was 31.  Honestly, meds have been the most important thing to help me cope.  Aside from that, using a planner consistently, making lists with check boxes for very short term manageable goals, and keeping track of my diet (making sure I'm not skipping meals).
"
"I dont understand why you needing to organise a way of distancing yourself from your father is 'confronting' your brother, or, why you have concerns about this conversation coming across as disrespectful.

&amp;#x200B;

I suggest you just be honest with him, sit him down, and tell him exactly whats on your mind. ""Look, I hate coming to you with this. I know this is the most important day of your life but I have to have this conversation with you. I am really freaking out and its upsetting me that I have to see dad, and Im not sure how to handle it. I was wondering if you could help me to figure it out"".  Reassure him that you want to be there for him, and you want him to have the best possible day. Tell him how much you care about that, but make it clear you have to feel safe and have a plan for handling the contact with your dad. "
"I obviously can't diagnose you over the internet, but I can say that lack of appetite is a symptom of many conditions such as depression or anxiety. So it's probably not that oversleeping causes a lack of eating and that is causing your depression, but rather, your depression is causing your lack of eating. Just like your depression causes the oversleeping.

""Starvation mode"" is something your body does over a long period of time. Not 18 hours. It requires an extended period of inadequate calories. Eating well and taking care of yourself is important for your mental health, though. Sometimes that means eating or drinking even when you're not hungry or thirsty.

If it's not all being caused by the depression, I would say maybe a medical issue, in which case, I'd advise you to talk to another doctor that's willing to run some tests. "
"First I would like to say I'm sorry you're not feeling well. It gets better remember that! Secondly if I may ask do you have professional help for the depression/anxiety? Otherwise I would recommend you do get it. I know it sounds like a tape on repeat but I really believe it helps when open to it. 

Now concerning your actual question. I'm not a psychologist and therefore anything I say is personal experience and at best a guess. It's sure has a lot of depression traits in your story. However have you ever been tested for a personality disorder? I know that sounds scary but it's manageable if you had it. 

Signs from autism, ADHD and others are pretty common in them. It's like they suspect you to have them, when tested though you might score higher then average but its not a solid diagnosis. I hope you understand what I mean. 

Once again I highly recommend you talk to a professional about this. We can only give you advice and help you with a listening ear. Only they can diagnose you. 

I hope I was of some help! If you ever need to talk or vent I'll be here!

Kind regards,

Astyv "
"Firstly, I know what it's like and you're not alone. I had disassociated episodes every day for I can't remember how long. Sometimes they would last for maybe an hour, maybe a few and sometimes all day. It's a year on now and I haven't had one episode. I didn't use medication but I'll tell you what I did. 

I was in counselling when I realised I was experiencing dissociated  episodes. I realised although they were comforting I needed to stop them because I din't want my mental health to deteriorate. This what I did: 

1) I wrote a list of all the things I'm afraid of and read them out to my counsellor. Once I said them out loud I felt relieved
2) I let myself feel all the feelings that came with that list, I was sad, I was angry, shameful, scared, etc. I din't let myself wallow
3) I made a list of how I could address some of these fears in a realistic way. 
4) Patiently I addressed what I could and tried to re frame how I spoke to myself. Before I did something scary, I would take a deep breath and say 'everything will be ok'. Doing these things helped me build my confidence a little.  
5) Lastly I wrote down my story. I wrote down the hardest thing that happened in my life. I didn't edit it. I wrote it exactly how it was and how I felt. No guilt and no shame. The truth as I saw it. Writing that was the best thing I ever did. It set me free. My biggest fear was people finding out I had Trich so I decided to face that fear that only way I could think of. I decided to publish my story, this is making it easier to moving. 

I also use as many things as I can that make me feel authentic and real. I write things and I make things. I also do yoga which helps with my body and helps with my negative self talks. This helps a lot with self soothing too. 

I don't know if this helps but if you need someone to talk to, I'm here and I get it.

Definitely something like pathological lying is a symptom of many illnesses.
Everyone needs a break. Even if you don't think you can afford to take one.

How do you expect to get effective treatment if you refuse to do check-ups?
"I havent! But sound usually stops my brain from buzzing, thanks for the tip!"
I hope it works out for you! How does a psychiatrist help in this situation?
I mean its gross but a habit..no? Why does it need to be an illness symptom?
"I talked to my doctor, he reccomended me a therapist. Thanks for the advice."
I'm sorry this is the case. I would urge you to if these thoughts carry on.
I'm working to open up with things. I know it's something I have to improve.
It’s okay! Don’t :( be :). It’s a mental disorder. You have no faults.
I’d love to chat with you in PM’s. This is actually pretty interesting.
Massage me if you need someone to talk to. I will respond. Every single day.
"Oh thanks this is super interesting, can never usually find anything online "
"Thank you c: I'm hoping it'll get better eventually, and hope you do too ♥"
"That's true, and I am proud you talked to her, that was very strong of you. "
These are intrusive thoughts and should be talked over with a psychiatrist.

Anyhow, I don't know if I have any advice, but I am here to talk."
"Hey, based on my guess (not a professional just tons of research) he might have a personality disorder. Judging from the trauma of war, and over-sensitivity. Google and research BPD (borderline personality disorder) and try and see if the symptoms match his personality. Good luck, and tell me what you think after researching. :)  "
"I agree it is worrying.  One possibility is a hormone change (e.g., thyroid deficiency) and he is genuinely tired.  Another is that he's doing a recreational drug by himself.  Also, it may be related to a new set of friends.  It seems that his sudden change occurred at about the same time he started spending time with his new GF. "
"It must feel crazy having your therapist right there one day, and then suddenly not having that support the next day. I agree with the other comment, try contacting her and asking for suggestions on other therapists. 

I've read a lot about CBT and I really want to try it out. Do you feel like you learned a lot of skills from it? "
"It seems weirder that you're going through people's post histories to see whether what they say they are diagnosed with matches with what they've said before or not. Why?  

You said it yourself that diagnoses can change, and as well, if you're diagnosed with different things, you might not mention them all at once all the time.  "
Read the edit. Your right I find sometimes the best thing to say is nothing. I just don't want to be silent all the time when there is more I could possibly be doing. And your right there are so many people in this profession that shouldn't be in it that are either ex-cops or jailors and treat the patients like they are criminals.

"This is where I am in an internal war with myself. I know he is unwell but he has such a fear of abandonment, of people being against him and is so stubborn in his thinking that he will 100% that it was my goal to get him locked up and he will hate me for the rest of his life. I also believe it may exacerbate his mental health... "
You need to go see a doctor if you haven't already. I want to help you but there's not much I can do other than listen. You need to find somebody to talk this stuff out to. It's the only way you'll get these thoughts and feelings out of your head. Go see a therapist. You need to force yourself to do this if you want to get better.
"I'm actually pretty sure I understand 100% what you mean. I struggle with telling whether I'm lying to myself or not and I often don't trust things I think because of it. Sometimes I've caught my lies and due to this I go back and forth on subjects a ton while I try to figure out whether I'm lying or if I'm being stupid and the part I think is lying is actually telling the truth. It's a hassle and I don't know any methods getting around it.
I'm also not sure if that's normal or not. I hope I understood what you meant &lt;3 
If I didn't feel free to tell me and help me understand :)"
"It doesn’t seem like you are seeing a therapist. If this is at all available to you, PLEASE go see one! You deserve to work out your problems, learn new coping mechanisms, maybe work through some trauma’s. 

Besides that, I started university and found out that I couldn’t handle it either. I have now taken the time to sort out my mental health first, before I continue with studying. Now I have a less-than-ideal home situation that I can fall back on and than I can sort of handle, so it’s okay for me to take this break. I hope you can figure out what will work best for you. "
"Yes, I did, because I get horrendously addicted to just about anything. Even one taste of it and it's all I can think about and I'll sacrifice just about anything to continue doing it. It changes all of my values and makes me not care about what it will do to me and I repeat the same horrible cycle over and over. Being an addict is part of my illness. That's just one way weed can affect people badly. Some people are extremely sensitive to it and can experience intense psychosis and suffer years of PTSD. Recommending it the way you did is risky and ignorant. There are safer options."
"When under stressful situations, the mind can undergo a state called ""derealization or depersonalization"" its kind of a strange feeling of unreality. I have been through it before and it sucks.

I do not know your situation, have you had any history of mental illness in the past? The only reason that I am asking is that perhaps the mushroom trip was stressful to you and as a result was a catalyst to anxiety and anxious ways of thinking that you are prone to. This is pure theory and I am no expert in this sort of thing, so **don't** take what I say as valid even if it may seem to apply to your situation. 

It seems to be affecting your life negatively and I hope you feel better. Maybe you should go see a therapist, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is designed to restructure the way you think for the better. 

Good Luck!"
"this is a daily struggle for me, and I’d be lying if I said i wasn’t doing it right now while on reddit. 

One thing that has made an impact for me is trying to get rid of the “monkey brain”. Do you feel like this because of the overwhelming feeling of the amount of work you need to do? Or the thought of doing the work, and finding it hard to prioritize? It’s called the “monkey brain”, I get it when i think about all the work and jobs and projects i have to do in a day. 
The solution that’s helped me here is as soon as I wake up, i write down a list of the things i want to accomplish that day.. and just that ONE day. usually i have a 2-5 things like: “Do laundry, work on my work project, call Mom, buy groceries”. Easy, attainable tasks that help me feel accomplished when I cross them off. Maybe it will help you! "
"Sounds like bipolar. It's common enough that we know  a bit about it scientifically, and there is avenues that can help you manage the ups and downs. You'll likely feel like there's no hope when you're on a down, that you lose interest in things that usually give you joy. When you're up you might feel like you don't need much sleep, that you want to spend money, that you are really lucky, unstoppable. That you can achieve anything and that you're extra special, maybe even that you've been chosen. 

Just like any illness, its not your fault and your brain is just doing some things that gives you these feelings that can be hard to manage when they are so unpredictable. You can do some things to help. 
Talk to a professional. It can help to have it spoken about out loud, to see the thoughts in real life rather than in your head. Keep eating well,do exercise and practice anything that makes you feel grounded in the present moment. Could be sport, music, art, walking in nature, designing something. Good to do things that involve your hands, maybe even building or origami or stretching.

"You're welcome :)   


I can totally understand that fear of having your private information disclosed somewhere random. That would be extremely negligent on their part, and they should def have some kind of policy for confidentiality and protecting people's personal files. If your records were to be seen by anyone other than the doctors, you may even be able to sue for that! I think it's also great that you are concerned not only for your own files/confidentiality, but also with the well-being of other patients and protecting their confidentiality as well, not wanting something like this to repeat, not wanting someone to experience how shitty you felt. You understand first hand how hurtful and dismissive it feels and care enough to file a complaint and make a point about this kind of situation!  It must be horrible enough, as you mentioned being trapped in the ER and guarded, feeling so scared, and THEN to have to worry about your personal files being misplaced or possibly not even recorded properly? Thats adding insult to injury and you have every right to feel as angry as you do, so don't think your reaction is a result of ""emotional regulation issues"" - your emotions are very appropriate and reflective of how horrible this situation was.   


I hope they get back to you soon and give you the answers and apology that you deserve ! "
"
No, it is absolutely not your fault. ADHD causes are unknown in most cases.

Appreciate the support ! �� I hope all works well for you in conclusion.
Are you in uni? How are you able to find the drive to study and stay focused?
Are you on any medication? Have you discussed your situation with an expert?
Can you go to a doctor? What kind of support / services are available to you?
"Dumbass you lumped ALL Autistic children/adults into one. Now be gone moron.

How can this be achieved? He does not want to see a Dr under any circumstance
I do this nearly every day. I'm always judging myself even if others aren't.
I don’t think that’ll make you feel better but I wanted to say something
"I have an initial consultation scheduled, but any input would be appreciated."
I have only cut at work. I work in a medical center with plenty of scalpels.

It seems like you are conflating healthy anxiety with pathological anxiety.
I’m glad I’m not alone. I don’t want other people to think I’m crazy
I’m sorry. It sucks. It’s somewhat relieving to know I’m not alone tho
Lol don't stress until you have to start asking yourself what you just said.
Not if you read the article. The post title is a bit sensationalised though.

Thank you I appreciate this insight. I think I will start the regime tomorrow
Thank you so much! This is actually really touching. I’ll start my search!
Thank you so much! You are a beautiful person. God bless you and your family.
Thank you! Ive been feeling guilty about it and it adds up to my own baggage
There is no too much or little. Any therapist can charge whatever they want.
"Triple posting now, I see.

That's what I read because that's what you wrote."
Yeah in some ways. It's pretty heartbreaking. Just go to therapy. It'll help.
but specifically? What do you fear right now? And how likely is it to happen?
sure if its cool with you... but the most important one.. do you have a job?.
"Because it isn't private.  I assure you,  I didn't explain more in this post because it wasn't my focus but I've been manipulative, denied, blamed,  minimized,  resorted to gaslighting, isolated,  and genuinely been pretty inhuman to her despite all her requests that I seek professional help and grow as a person,  partner and dad. "
If you really want off them please take smaller and smaller doses. Coming off even a small dose from a few weeks can seriously make things worse (I stopped taking a small dose of anti psychotics and I went through hell and made me really ill) if you can go speak to your doctor and tell them you don’t want to be on them any more.
"I’m glad things have gotten better for you! I don’t think mine is fixed to one place (unless i really got screwed lmao) because it happened at my first house with my family, my grandmas house when i moved in, and now the house i’m renting with my sister. it’s different creatures/manifestations albeit, but similar sensations"
"Oh Dear. I went into a depression when my pupper died as well. Honestly still mourning his loss 4 years on. I don’t have much useful to say but that I hear you, I’ve been there, and that the grief will get smaller on your horizon as time passes. Is there maybe a little pupper that you could save that could maybe also save you? "
One of my compulsions is asking questions. What’s really embarrassing is when I call someone and ask a question and have a whole convo about it and then when I hang up I think “wait...what if i misunderstood” and then I have to call back. And then again. It’s embarrassing the whole damn time but sometimes I can’t help it.
"Only all the time. I've been on three psychiatric holds this month (August) because I over-shared my thoughts. I made a snarky remark that was taken literally. Sigh.

My thoughts scare me sometimes, but I take solace in knowing that I'm aware enough to know the difference between what I might act on versus just a fleeting thought. "
"Vigorous physical exercise really helped me. I joined a boxing gym; just smashing the crap out of a bag three times a week really allowed me to vent some shit that would have made for scorched earth in my personal life if I hadnt had the outlet. Im not even a particularly physical person. I just found it worked, and kept doing it. "
"b/p cycles? Do you mean bipolar by that? I'm in a deep depression at the tail end of a very manic summer, only heightened by the intense sunny weather we've seen in the UK. I'm diagnosed with BPD but sometimes think it's bipolar because of my mood cyclings correlation with the seasons. Interested in hearing how your cycles present?"
"He only hurts people when people mess with him or mock him trouble is he's a dangerous guy once their was one instant where some guy raided his fridge took all his food the guy did a runner and my mate was planning to beat him up if he dosent play him for the food he took his food hes territorial in his house I would not mess with him people under estimate him but I know better he says quote ""if people mess with me I will mess with them society is not the boss of me I will never conform"" what strikes me is he never goes out looking to fight its people who give it to him who he hates"
"I'm really pleased to hear that. For what it's worth, insomnia, anxiety and depression were problem areas for me for 5 years. But for the last year and a half I've been back to normal (more or less) and it's great. The reason I'm saying that, is that I've had all the same symptoms you've described and come out the other side so please do have some hope. Try the antidepressants. I cycled few a few until I found one which really helped (for me it's sertraline but everyone's different). Also exercise, nutrition and sleep are important. Good luck and do post updates if that might help! "
"Oh dear, I am so sorry he said this to you.  This is not acceptable.  Please please please reach out and tell another adult at the school- even if you only can manage to send an email.  Please tell someone.  Nobody should be shamed into showing their scars.  The part about performance art involving blood/self mutilation is very disturbing.  It almost seems like he is getting his jollies from self harm and more specifically from learning and watching others do self harm.  Please please please tell another adult at the school.  It might even be a good idea to tell more than 1 adult.  "
"Oh, I pretty much always look like a loon. It happens. It wasn’t an anger outburst, but I couldn’t visually or intellectually process which of two doors to go through today when I went to the lab for a new blood draw, which is absolutely ridiculous. I just stood there looking stupid for a minute and couldn’t figure out what to do. I finally went to the right because that’s my default direction if I’m not sure where to go. Ended up being the right door. Dumb luck. 

Record the outbursts and turn the set of them into an art exhibit. Fortune and glory are all but guaranteed. "
"I recognize that thoughts like that are intrusive and just fuck me up so try to get out of that thought spiral asap. Tell someone my anxiety is coming. Do something nice for myself. Do something distracting. 

And if you practice mindfulness you can prepare answers for yourself ahead of time to stop a spiral too. Like if you know that a certain thought comes into your head and it goes downhill after that, you can prepare. For example, you are having a nice moment with friends and it hits you that everyone could die tomorrow and everything is meaningless. The answer that helps you come back to the moment could be something like “The fact that I am worried about losing this means that it is meaningful, at least to me, and worrying is only taking me out of a precious moment and will do absolutely nothing for me”. I hope that helps. "
"I don't want to appear ignorant or harsh (although I did have a period in my life where I felt a very strong connection to a god, if that helps), but are you sure that you need this? Many, many people live fulfilling lives without this connection so, perhaps, you are just evolving as a person and are experiencing some kind of crisis as one part of you wants to hold on to something that another part of you wants to let go of.

I would recommend not putting any pressure on yourself to feel one way or the other. If you don't feel a connection to god then that's okay - you can still be a good, happy, fulfilled person without that connection. It just might take some time to adjust to that. If you find that the connection comes back by itself then that's also fine. But I would say letting it happen (or not happen) is the best path. Otherwise you risk repressing your true feelings, which will ultimately be damaging.

I do think there are probably better places to post this in that you might get more support elsewhere but if this is affecting your mental health then I definitely don't think it's the *wrong* place.

I would say that you should just focus on being a good person and living your life compassionately. Your spirituality will be reflected by this and you will naturally find your own path. Whatever path you take will be the right one."
"I have written a [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/8pc8ig/my_story/) with a more in depth story of my diagnosis/recovery. But I have experienced psychosis. The best way I can start to explain how it was for me is like this: Imagine that you are solving a problem, say that it is a math problem or whatever. A split second before the idea is in your head you just have this feeling in your mind, that ""I've figured it out"" feeling. This is a very fleeting feeling, and shortly after the answer is in your head and you write it down and the feeling is gone. When I started to lose touch with reality, it was like that ""I've figured it out"" feeling was just turned on. I was constantly in this state of ""I am trying to figure something out/I am figuring out everything"". So it was like my mind was open to be rewritten. Suddenly every random thing that popped into my head was some new great truth of the universe. Over the span of three days being awake I rewrote reality in my mind. I didn't know what was real anymore. I ended up being taken out of my house in handcuffs and spent 5 days in a psych ward. Took another year before I was diagnosed Bipolar Type 1. Took two years before I fully recovered from my alternate reality. I'm pretty sure I have a good idea what is up now. Let me know if you have any more specific questions."
"I have/had very similar symptoms to you, see my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9gu2kr/im_winning/). 

Forget the meds, depending where you are, I'm in the UK, I would see my GP doctor and get a referral to see a counsellor for anxiety therapy. Talking to a professional like that has helped me so much, I'm able to combat everyday things that I thought was normal but were things holding me back from leading a better life. It all started from points in my childhood and early teenage life and that's the same for alot of people here. It's fantastically interesting learning how certain things that have happened when your 9 years old for example affect you when you're my age at 23, even if it is negatively impacting it's still interesting to learn how.

Your parents won't laugh at you if you tell them, I thought the same, I felt weak and then every single member of my family came to me and told me they had the same story, they developed anxiety/depression and dealt with it and became stronger, maybe other members of your family have gone through it and not told you but the worst thing you can do is bottle it all up until you crack again like I did. Tell your parents, get the counselling/therapy from a good professional that you like as finding the right person can be a battle for some.

I found having a mentor also reduced my anxiety at your age, I had a physics tutor I aspired to, he was charismatic, had a good family and a nice place and always done right by people and he taught me more then physics, he taught me taxes and government and how to change a tyre etc.

You've also got to remember and I know it's difficult as you have said all your family members are outgoing individuals but the vast majority of people on this planet do not like public speaking and/or are not confident speaking to an audience or many people. I hate running meetings in the office, I don't like talking to people that much but I know what I like and what I don't like, I know what I need to do and work hard at it. Comparing yourself to others and feeling bad because of it is wrong, you are your own person and should remember that, you don't need to be concerned on what others say/do. Who cares if the cool guy at school goes travelling but you don't like flying and won't go, you lead your own life and do what you need and want to do, comparisons kill me daily sometimes, but slowly and surely I am getting through it and much more confident and defiant then before.

All anxiety is in your mind, that is why it's a mental illness, I don't believe your can gain a natural physical anxiety that isn't controlled or at-least contributed by the brain. Talking to someone will definitely fix this, do it at your own pace at a time that suits you and do the things you enjoy in life, whether that's playing xbox or exercising.

Keep strong, you can overcome anything."

"You could try dividing your day up in 2 sections.  Two mini-days, I guess.  I think it's a fairly common strategy for combatting this sort of inertia. At 2pm or whenever, day #2 starts.

"I think the first time this happened to me was when I was 11. I saw my face in the school bathroom mirror and for a brief moment I couldn't believe it was me. I thought it was cool and edgy to toy with the idea of consciousness and self.

Now I can't look into the mirror for more than a few seconds. It freaks me the fuck out. I know that's my face but it still looks like a character from a movie instead of being me.

It's not edgy or cool or a good idea to play with these concepts for too long, because you're just a couple of thoughts away from a whole new kind of existential crisis."
"I'm so sorry you're going through this... Have you spoken to him about couple's therapy? this might be a good way to get him in front of someone without making it about his mental health. Also maybe having a third party say these things are not happening might make him snap out of his delusion?

I haven't been in a situation like this, but do you feel that this is a safe situation for you and your children?

A lot to think about... again, so sorry you're going through this... good luck and hope he can find some peace in his mind and sending positive thoughts to you and your family..."
"This is definitely not your fault; don't let her convince you otherwise. Sounds to me like she's blaming you to deflect any blame from herself. ADHD is genetic, but depression and anxiety can be influenced by your parents behavior growing up. Is this kind of behavior the way she normally acts toward you? If so, I would definitely start to talk about your relationship with her with your therapist. Often, when your parents have treated you badly growing up, it can seem normal because it's all you've ever known. If any of this sounds familiar to you, try visiting r/raisedbynarcissists. "
"hi there! i relate very much to this and the best advice I can give you is that if you think you need it, go for it. Never think that you will go into a therapy session and that the therapist will think there is nothing wrong with you. If you feel like you want someone to talk to that's different than family or friends then do it. I really was scared of therapy for a while and then I found out about this website called BetterHelp and it's a really great common ground between getting help I need and my feelings of embarrassment around therapy. Hope this helps and best of luck to you. "
"Maybe consider you don’t have any mental illness. Maybe you can get help for your anger. Maybe if you realized that birth entitles you to nothing you could let go of what seems like expectations. Most people get screwed by something or another that’s not ultimately their fault. The same may be for your parents. You do probably have a choice to stop the circle of pain. Maybe just look at it and decide what you want to change - then either think and think and think or get some help to break it down. Don’t punish yourself that you can’t do demanding things. Look for small gains. Make mistakes and forgive yourself... trying... really trying is not failing. How can you think of demanding things... you are probably carrying the weight of a pain long a go exercised. Learn to release the pain. Then I guess you’ll find some light.

"Once I found a therapist I could learn from, that's when I knew they were right for me. If I was growing and learning how to handle my depression/stress/anxiety, that's how I got better. 

Luckily my first solo counselor (not family) was a perfect match. He helped me stop self harming and controlling my anger. I saw a few after him once my insurance wasn't in his career employment anymore, never went well. 

Always left feeling more mixed up or just as depressed and not feeling like I even sat there for an hour talking about anything. 

My latest counselor really taught me how to control my PTSD, flashbacks were finally not consuming me. It took about two or three visits before I could tell if it was for me or not, but that's how it goes. 

Trial and error, what I always say with finding someone who truly understands how to help you. "
Sorry to hear about your situation it can be so difficult trying to support someone who is afraid of getting help.You probably already tried this it similar but maybe offer to go with your friend to a therapist or maybe a group therapy session to reassure them and also make sure they aren’t mistreated by mental health professionals like before? Another thing that helped me get help was doing it for someone else- without making it seem like a guilt trip it can be beneficial to ask that they get help as a favour to you? I don’t know that’s personally what I find helpful when I don’t want to help myself  but obviously don’t try that if you think it’ll make them feel guilty or anything. Other than that there isn’t much that a friend can do apart from listen and help to calm them down which it sounds like you are doing well:)
"As someone who tried to kill myself when I was 16 (this was over a decade ago) I have some comments from another perspective.

One thing that overshadows quite a lot of the rest is how traumatized I was from my hospital experience, which is actually very common.  Even though it was so long ago, it still really affects me today.  I would ask him how his experience is in the hospital and see if there is anything you can do to help that.

My mo also really got on my case about my mental health after that.  She checked in wit me constantly and clearly didn't trust me.  After every therapy session she asked me what we talked about and my progress.  It drove me crazy.  To me it felt like it should be enough that it is between me and the therapist, but for some reason she felt like she had to be part of it.  There was also some guilt tripping.  It put a severe damper on my relationship with her until I left for college.  I needed support, but she ended up being another person I had to 'deal with' and just caused me more anxiety.

If you want to talk more about it, feel free to reply or PM me."
"I am so sorry that your mom dismissed whatever you experienced as a child. There could be something that happened. Therapy is your best option to get the help you need. There may be options for you. I have a couple of places online that may be able to help you find some resources. There are online support groups, but vet them carefully. I got caught up in drama and unethical behavior in one such group. But these sites I am sharing are reputable. RAINN.org has an option to chat with someone. I have however seen mixed reviews on this. Though,they may be able to lead you to a place in your area where you can get affordable help. Another site I recommend is pandys.org. They have a lot of information, articles, blogs and some moderated forums that you can participate in.

I hope you can find a way to see a therapist, because that is what will help you the most right now. Keep searching for answers. Your gut is telling you something and keep listening to it. You will doubt yourself, especially with a Nmom. But don’t stop searching for answers and healing. I wish you well on this journey.

"It’s worth considering why he says it. He’s making a conscious decision to say those things to you. Why would he do that? You’ve told him that those comments hurt you, but he justifies them. So the real question is: why does he justify behavior that hurts his wife?

It tells me that he wants to hurt you. He knows those comments hurt your feelings, and justifies the behavior when you call him out. 

Also, I’m a batterers intervention therapist, and I can tell you a lot of abusers have behaviors like this. Oftentimes this behavior is a mechanism of control by lowering your self-esteem. We typically call this “baby batterer” behavior, because it’s controlling behavior that takes power in the relationship without being intimidating or physically abusive. 

Just worth thinking about.  

EDIT: Because my credits are being questioned, please refer to my flair on the /r/psychotherapy subreddit. My flair of a counselor was approved by the moderators after sending them documentation that I have my LPC. That's the only way I know how to prove that without sending personal documents."
"As someone who has been in therapy for years and has tried out numerous therapists, there is no shame in ""shopping around."" You have to find a therapist that is YOUR person. My current therapist is one of my favorite people in my life, we have a similar sense of humor and the input he gives me really resonates with me and I look forward to going to see him every week. I know a lot of people say that age doesn't matter in a therapist which I agree with but I believe that you need to find someone that certainly understands and accepts your age group. I had a very shy, conservative vibe therapist and I had a really hard time talking to her about a lot of aspects of my life such as relationships and sex and questions I have that I don't want to talk to my parents about. My current one is in his early 40s but he makes me feel really comfortable talking about absolutely anything and doesn't make it feel awkward or embarassing. 

Also, when my mom used to go to therapy with me it felt uncomfortable and like a very controlled environment that I didn't get much out of. I met my current therapist when I was 24 so years after parent involvement but his stance on working with young people is that he will meet the parents at first but they are not to be involved most sessions unless there is something truly concerning otherwise it's just one on one with him and the patient.


I've had plenty of wrong therapists now to realize that if it doesn't feel right then it's probably not the right situation for you. I don't know if all this helps but I wish somebody had encouraged me to look around earlier on."

Thank you for you time and thought-out reply"
I go to therapy but she isn't much help. I quit University cause of my problems
I hear that pressing ice to your skin can help with mitigating self harm urges.
I started crying at the first one and couldn't watch a whole half minute of It.
It started at 9 and my parents fight a lot so I guess that’s how it started.

Your counselor at school sgould be able to help. I think its called ruminating.
its a lot of government paperwork but it may be possible in some jurisdictions.
"I think you need to accept that you're not going to get their patience and understanding and support. That sucks, and of course it would be better if you had it, but you have to deal with things as they are. You can't control other people's behavior. You need to work out a plan to get better that doesn't rely on your family changing."
"Just wanted to add - I checked out your history, and you do a fair amount of baiting/engaging with this person. It would probably be better for you if you just choose to ignore or block them. You’re only encouraging them by engaging, and the more you engage, the more ridiculous things they’ll say. I think they’re just a troll. "
"&gt;He has in the past been very unsuccessful in maintaining relationships until this year.

My initial reaction to your description is that it is normal for a sibling/son to be very secretive and personal about his first real love relationship.  Nothing strange about that.  Why do you say he was ""very unsuccessful"" with prior relationships?  How long did they last and how did he push the GFs away?

Also, did you ever consider that he has started avoided family gatherings at a time when he is 30 years old and still living at home?  He may be feeling like he should be more independent."
"From my experience with someone you was abused (my ex was abused, and her defense mechanism was to be manipulative), I would be wary.

However, just because I had a bad experience does not mean that yours is the same. Like pennyturtle said, it might just be her love language. Also I don't know her in any capacity.

From what you have said, everything has been pretty benign so far despite some erratic behaviors, if stuff happens that makes you uncomfortable don't be afraid to set your boundaries.

Also, talk to other people you trust about this, they might be able to give some insight."
"I want to share something called the ironic rebound effect. Try not to think about a white bear.....

.....

You’re thinking about it more now right? It’s the same thing with suicide. Trying not to think about it will only make it come back stronger. Allow yourself to really think about it and what it would mean for you. It’s ok to think about these things and ironically, thinking deeply about it could help it go away more than not thinking about it or trying to get it out or trying not to think about it.

I’m not a mental health professional, but hey, I read it in a book :)

"In 2011, within the space of a week, I lost my job, my house and my marriage. I had two children under 3, one of them with special needs, and a whopping case of bipolar disorder. Two years ago I bought a 4 bedroom house, my kids are healthy and happy, and I have the best job I’ve ever had making more money than I thought possible. It hasn’t been easy; I struggle with depression, still, and some days are really hard. But it is possible. I never thought I’d recover from that time, but I did. Now I know I can survive anything and come out the other side, and that’s worth it all. "
So don't be. You don't get paid for it. You don't get applause for it. Most people get used to it and end up using you for it. You need to stop whatever it is that's causing you to feel this way and take care of yourself. I don't need to know specifics of your life to know you're in a tough spot you're asking for help. So here's what you do. Get help. Seriously. It isn't taboo to get mental help. No diff than physical help. Except mental health effects everything. Over time your physical health will suffer and continue to suffer until you change the thing(s) that effects you this way.
"I’ve struggled with affection too. I have sensory issues and don’t like being touched. I have ADHD and sometimes misread social cues so I can be inappropriate. I’m pretty sure I’m borderline on the autism spectrum, but not enough to be clinically relevant. The only affection I don’t “endure” (ie, just barely tolerate) is affection from my kids. I actually love that affection and give freely back. Anyone else, even romantic partners, I force myself out of social convention to be affectionate. I don’t think it’s a mental disorder, but it could be indicative of some neurodiversity-no harm in pursuing that avenue. 

With all this, how do YOU feel about affection? Is it that you don’t want to be touched and are doing it out of social convention? Or do you long to be touched or to touch others (even platonically), but can’t seem to bring yourself to? If it’s the first case, then that is your choice, and it is okay to feel that way. If the second, seeing a professional might help you overcome social barriers. Especially if your dislike of affection has roots in trauma. "
"Thanks, and yes, totally understand that. That’s why I want to work with local, state, federal elected officials to make changes. Lately I’ve needed to take my dog everywhere because my PTSD is super heightened. 

Interestingly enough, I received this note back from Whole Foods and it confuses the matter further for me. 

“The ADA requires businesses to grant access to disabled people with service animals, even in places where animals would not normally be allowed. People with service animals are not required to carry any sort of special identification and as retailers we can only ask if the animal is a service animal, and what service the animal is trained to provide.” They pulled this from an ADA website. 

So they basically just told me that if I lie about why I have him they won’t give me trouble. 

I do want to make real change and am working on it first by starting conversations and hopefully reducing stigma. I’m having a particularly hard time right now so this infuriated me. I can barely make it through a day and I just didn’t need to be called out... not tonight. "
"This is probably a post more for a relationship subreddit. However I will say that I hope the best for L in this difficult time and that she doesn't go back to R. How long had they been dating? This could be a 'mask slipping off' kind of thing. The mask can be quite convincing so when it gets removed it can seem like a sudden change when in reality it's just a bait and switch. Most physical/sexual abusers typically wait about 8-14 months before hitting the first time which is usually preluded by yelling. He may indeed be using drugs but no amount of even the hardest drugs will make someone hit you or threaten you with sexual violence or rape. Drugs only lower the inhibitions letting already existing impulses manifest and either way it's still no exuse. Most likely, unless this individual, of their own volition, confronts their own abusiveness, takes full responsibility for it and seeks help, the behavior will never change.

Btw please try and include a content warning on things like this. There are lots of people who have experienced similar things and this could be triggering for them."
"Thanks and yes I understand it's not optimal to withhold information. Part of it as trust as you suggest. My previous psychiatrist had somewhat of a language barrier. English was her second language and she had trouble understanding some things I would say which was compounded by her age. She was forced to transcribe all of her notes on a computer and her age and capability with computers made this a burden on her I realized. So anything I would say would take an inordinate amount of time for her to type. She'd essentially ignore me to focus on typing for minutes at a time. The appointments were a pain to attend because of this. I know she was intelligent and accomplished, but was potentially out of her league with technology.   


I have avoided support groups since I have been withholding information, but I think they could be a good option once I lay all my cards on the table at my next appointment within a week.   


As far my supervisor goes, I had a breakdown recently during an especially stressful period at work due to deadlines and demands. I went to seek treatment when possible. When I returned I was met with ""Don't be selfish, think about what your absence did to our team"". I honestly couldn't understand their point of view as I was in a very deep depression and considering drastic things. I just acknowledged their statements. I was just completely broken by such statements. I don't think further conversations would help the situation based on their mindset. I'm starting to accept that seeking further treatment would mean switching career fields be it a slow or fast transition. "
"Yes I can relate. I'm from South America, and I've been living in Chicago on my own since 2013. It takes a while to form good circles. I met my best friend at one of my previous jobs, in 2014 (So there you have, a whole year alone). I knew a couple other girls from before and I didn't meet another new person I really connected with until 2016, just to give you perspective on how long it took me (and as you can see, I dont have a book full of contacts, either). I mean I have acquaintances but I'm talking friends friends. Like you said, people I can spill my guts to. 

Can you try to find a guitar class, or group? Try meetup.com to find gatherings related to all those things you mentioned, I guarantee you will find writing, book clubs, music...things of all kind. I use it to find people getting together to paint (that's my thing). People use meetup precisely for this. A class would be ideal because it's the same people over and over going there. You see it takes time to form a bond with someone, that's why I'm putting so much emphasis on the regularity of meeting. I can't think of any of my friends that we just met once and became the BFFs we are now. We hung out a few times at the very least. And my BFF well I saw her everyday at work. By the time I left that place we just didn't stop seeing each other.

Annoying is on the eye of the beholder, if you ask me, an annoying person would be a clingy person, someone who is in your face all the time when obviously you are not reciprocating. (if you both were in each other's faces all the time this thread probably wouldn't exist in the first place). Rude, way too intense, bad taste joke people just turn me off, but that's just me and the way I interact and look for in other people. You may be very different and enjoying being with loud people, what do I know? I was just giving examples of what may turn people off away from someone but take it like a grain of salt, try to translate it into your context.

I'm glad I helped some. Remember most likely nothing is wrong with you, it just takes time and you need to find the right activity. :) Best of luck!"
"""You can't control me"" 

Sounds like a 12 year old &amp; possibly a narcissist. "
Abandon any therapist that asks you this. The answer is what you need help with.
"Congratulations! That's an excellent way of looking at it. Keep on keepin on :]
"
"Great! All the best, I'm sure you'll Excel at whatever it is that you are doing!"
How long were you on it for? I got worse before I got better with the cymbalta.
"Huh, the boss may be said the wrong thing but he doesn't sound like an asshole. "
I do not smoke marijuana. I stay away from it because it gives me panic attacks.
"I have a counselor, yeah, but beyond that I wasn't offered anything medical, no."
I tried to. The only things I can get from life are just more extreme suffering.
I want to blow my god dam brains out I'm so fucking sick of being fucking sick.
I will! Literally so whatever it takes at this point in time. Thank you so much
I've never heard of that till now. Thanks for mentioning it ill look into that.
Is the depression severe without the medication? And May I ask how old you are?
Is therapy usually free? Or cheap at least? I dont really have many options atm.
It’s not one of those situations where I feel unsafe. Thank you for the input.
"I’ve got one, I just feel like recovery isn’t possible so I don’t go much "

"Kati Morton, Psych2go, Dr Tracey Marks, Polar Warriors, Depression to Expression"
My little brother. He’s the only reason I’ve stayed alive the past 7 years.
No problem at all. Feel free to send me a Pm if you just need someone to talk to
"Ok, please message me, I think I'll be able to help you. I know what's going on."
Sleep. Seriously. Sleep deprivation severely exacerbates anxiety and depression.
"Thanks so much, I’m on it for a month to see how I react to it see we’ll see"
"We all have downs, please know we are all rooting for you.... Message any of us "
What makes you think they weren't related to psychosis? I would guess they were.
Where do you get this feeling? Throughout your entire body or just in your head.
Why can't they make a psyche med that causes weight loss instead of weight gain?
Yeah. None of us are alone though. There's a lot of people struggling right now.

"""Your mental health issues are a part of you, but they are not nearly all of you.  There is so much more to you.  Sometimes, focusing too much on specific symptoms or issues all the time will make them worse.  Make sure to spend as much or more time focused on the parts of your life that you enjoy.""

Paraphrased from a past therapist."
"As you said it could be panic as well. I got panic attacks from 5mg of Lexapro but not 10mg, unfortunately though you must raise the dosage slowly. Give it more time, you might need to push through that anxiety for a while until you hit a higher dose. If it doesn't work at 10 mg and you are still getting panic attacks try  citalopram."
"At first I thought it was because of that as well. I wouldn't necessarily say it's all relationships, I do love my friends and family but an amazing person (guy) could come along and I lose interest in a matter of days. I'm really hoping that it's because I haven't found the right person but I've been having a lot of anxiety about it."
"I think there comes a point where some of us have taken a bad habit to seeking medical care, which comes to a point where we are confused - we're used to needing it, yet we fight it because we're probably not in a wrong condition in the first place. Did you ever get to think about it? Because I have, and the thought is very appealing."
"My parents were the same way! I resented it for a long time. It’s a long story but I eventually learned some discipline when I started my own business. You will find yourself in your own time, just keep going. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just keep pushing yourself through each day surviving as best you can! You got this! "
"OOh we did! We went up to the State Park where you can grill out and OMword I have NEVER felt so happy! I couldn't let on to the kids that I was getting off on the flames...that kind of killed the joy just a smidge, but I really did enjoy myself fully. :) Such beauty in the flames...and the toasted marshmallows were DELISH. HAHAHA. :)"
"There is a lot of good advice here, I would only add that you should exercise. A lot. Walk, run, ride a bike, hit the gym at school. Anything to get your heart pumping. Take your girl for a walk, or find an activity that you both can enjoy.

You can do it. I promise. I left home at 17 for a better start. I am 54 now and love my life. "
"This isn't about me, it's about you! Seriously, if your friends are actually assholes like they seem to be, leave them while you still can. There are people in the world that I have no doubt would treasure you. School can be a really rough part of life, but hey, the people who struggle most in school are the ones who come out on top. "
"hmm i dont think anyone can give you a definite answer .. other than your friend himself. 

when I read it, i thought that maybe he was just feeling left out that he can't come at the same time as everyone, and didnt wanna show up later, on his own. Maybe something about how the situation was just made him feel excluded or something? "
"&gt; Ask her if she can help you get there. If she says yes, ask her specifically how/with what techniques. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still have an appointment with her next week. I think I will try this. Basically all I know about her so far techniques or otherwise is that she's an art therapist and in my insurance. But we don't do much art. She does try to help me set goals, and then I just...don't do them. And decide I don't care about \[goal\] anyway. I imagine I'm a pretty terrible patient. Thanks so much for the little script at the end too! I think that will come in handy.

"I believed and prayed as a child and all God did was watch as the people I loved got ill or murdered. I grew up in a country with an unstable population and a corrupt military. I've seen innocent people stabbed and shot before I turned 10. Where was your God then? Why did he allow those men to die? Why did he allow children to witness that knowing what it could do to them?  


Many people choose to believe because they turn to religion when all else fails. Well religion has failed me; I would choose to believe in no God before believing in a God that allows things to happen as they do."
"I learnt the hard way that the only way to get professionals to take you seriously is to always talk like it's the worst case scenario. That's the only way I got taken seriously and finally got some psychology. 

It sucks to be high functioning, and I still think people don't take me seriously now when I say I feel bad. The one exception is my awesome husband. He's very intuitive. 

Breaking down and getting emotional also helps a lot, I've found. It's not like waterworks on tap, it's more like I used to save up all the bad stuff and let it out when I saw a mental health professional. "
"That does sound like depression, friend. I suffer also, and sometimes I not only feel sad-low, but I feel sad-empty and sad-what-am-I-doing-with-my-life kind of thing, and while I do feel happiness, sometimes I wonder if it isn't just a defense mechanism so nobody will know how I am feeling. I relate to this and I hope you feel better. Try different things--hobbies, tv shows, anything that will make you feel good (within the law of course) and see if that doesn't help. I know how it feels to be searching for something when you have no idea what you are searching for. Good luck to you. "
"Well ive been reading some comments.. and you go outside still.. in the wild haha... which is better than me... I really hope you get cured man.. because I know how it feels to be isolated. to be different. as if you dont fit in in life. I dont have confidence in myself. Im lazy, but When I try to do something and I know how to do it, its done.. the only thing is tryi g to learn thats hard for me (adhd) amd I hate it...
I know how it feels to be forgetful. 
I know how it feels to search for days months .. for a cure that you will never find....

"You’re not harming those around you nor yourself which is great. Your mindful of your surroundings and have your own little tin which puts you in a superior hold than rather your brain telling you to do something worse. So applaud to you, seriously! In the meantime, keep doing what you’re doing. Therapy helps but it’s not for everybody. I hope if you like your therapist, you stick with them. In the meantime, find ways to cope with stress and other “triggers”. I looked online that it’s related to pyromania. Financial stability is stressful:/ so I understand. You can do this!"
"Dude, k know it's tough but you can't beat yourself up over it. You weren't lying with malice. You just didn't want to concern him. We've all done it. If he knew about it now he'd roll his eyes and get over it and I'm sure you know that. 

Grief brings out a lot of stuff and guilt is one of them. Whenever we lose someone we love we always find something we had said or done or wish we had to feel guilty over. It's normal and it's part of the process. The best thing you can do is allow yourself to feel what you need to feel, forgive yourself, and move on to the next thing. Grief is an ongoing process and little things are gonna keep coming up for a long time. Just let yourself go through them, without pushing them down but without dwelling. If you feel you can't do that effectively on your own due to your anxiety issues, see a counselor. "
"I think this happens to a lot of people. As another user suggested look into alternative ways to manage your finances. Additionally, there are counselors in the mental health field that specialize in both mental health and career counseling. Maybe it's worth it to look into this? This type of professional could help you build your self awareness, confidence and help you carve a path for yourself all while you develop skills to take through life.  

I also got a degree in fine arts and worked as a graphic designer...I feel your pain!! 10 years later im working as a tech in an emergency room and going farther into debt while getting my masters in mental health. I've pretty much given up on the fact that I'll ever make much money, but I'm happier now than I ever have been because I am engaged in and interested in what I'm doing. Good luck!"
"As someone who left all that madness I'm telling you LEAVE. Put everything on pause and LEAVE. I have PTSD myself from staying too long. You underestimate how long these emotional scars are gonna take to heal. Have your counselor make an ESA (Emotional Support Animal) Letter for your cat, that's what did when I moved in with a friend (she accepted me with her, she owns the unit, but the building is no-pets-- with an ESA letter you can get away with it). I also left mid semester and don't ask me why cause I messed up my finals but my prof. must have seen I had worked hard enough the rest of the semester and I got my As nevertheless. But if you have to pause just pause. It is not worth your well-being. I've been through this, please leave. The sooner you start the process the sooner you can start working on healing. Go no contact with him no matter what, because suddenly he will seem like he's back to his senses like when the relationship started. NOPE. 

Please leave. Find somewhere safe to go and leave. From woman to woman. It won't be easy at all but you will be happy you did I promise."
"I think it would be very smart to seek professional help.
A smart therapist won't think that you are any danger to other people, but you are probably a danger to yourself as you describe these nightmares and thoughts of self-harm and suicide. And there's a big risk that you would be able to harm yourself since you're thinking about these things. You can be doing well and still experience progress while having some dreams about bad things because your mind is working through some of that still and that can take time while you still are doing better. You can take two steps forward and one step back and sometimes two steps forward and two steps back, but in the whole, you are moving forward and that's a great thing. I think a way to keep moving forward while protecting yourself and your progress would be to seek professional help, because maybe you need to talk through some things that have happened to you, figure out some emotional stuff that can be the reasons behind your past depression and anxiety and also figure out ways to prevent them from bursting into your life again in the future."
"I understand what you mean about getting so angry over something like this. I'm not sure if you have a lot of other stresses in your life, but like me you're probably funneling a lot of your body's pent up negativity into something its culturally acceptable to get a little pissed over. 

A couple tips that might sound dumb, but worth a shot if you really don't wanna feel like a giant baby anymore: 1. Try to figure out how the situation is funny. Try to think about how stupid some of these guys are playing, and try to laugh at it, even if only to trick your brain. Grab a pillow and try to laugh at yourself for getting so mad at a game you won't remember in 10 years. Try to remember a game from 2 years ago and realize how little this moment matters. 
2. Meditate if you're ever willing. This can literally be just closing your eyes and taking in a huge gulp of oxygen, and holding it until you can't anymore before you let it out. Do this a few times during the game and this will literally relax all your muscles and scientifically soothe your brain. It feels best to do in these kinds of situations. Breathe through it and laugh about it. 

The previous comment was right too. Be able to decide you're not going to let a group of players who dont know you have control over your emotions. They dont care about you, don't let them ruin your whole day."

"I think it’s worth a shot! Especially since a ‘sub-clinical’ dose (I’m guessing 5 or 10mg) is just that.

At the very worst, it may get you more drunk on less alcohol lol"

And I always noticed that anything that could be a reason for my depression amplified it, with or without meds. The meds helped, but the depression was still very much there and very much felt. "
"One of the guys that jumped off the golden gate bridge said that if even one person had smiled at him on his walk over to the middle of the bridge, he would have turned back without jumping.  Sometimes, the smallest bit of human kindness is all we need to remember not everyone is unhappy to see us and sometimes there's reasons to live."
"Read on Dissociative Identity Disorder as well. A lot of good videos (30min-1hr) on you tube with research and Pdocs. 

Crosses/olive oil is a catholic thing. If parents died in a crash and he never got counseling, he could very well be stuck or trapped in trauma and a guilt cycle. 

Any siblings you’ve met or his friends/relatives? "
"Thank you very much for the help. I've recently been slowly pushing myself out of my comfort zone by doing simple things like saying hi to people with a smile, and not mumbling, stuff I'd never do even a month ago. As far as staying positive, I really try to but I just can't help to realize that I'm a loser and will probably die alone."
"Yes, Might_Mac is correct, as far as I know. The “diagnosis” of the symptom hypomania suggests some form of bipolar disorder or agitated depression of sorts. But psychotic depression and acute psychotic episodes often start with hypomania-type symptoms, and it can definitely be a part of any or all of the mental illnesses mentioned"
"&gt; I don't know what to do for my wife to console her and help her move on, but at the same time I just want us to be safe.

If you are in the US, your best move, as cruel as it sounds is to move and to leave no forwarding address.   I  have two relatives in law enforcement and they see this all the time and some of the stories are heartbreaking. There is no answer for this until he commits a felony.

&gt; But when we attempted to express our concerns to the state and his housing, they said they would handle it.

No, once the state takes over, you are pretty much out of the picture.

"
"I don’t know how it works for you. But for me, motivation dies out very quickly if I’m not interested in something. I don’t know if you can force motivation, discipline maybe. 

Don’t restrict yourself too much from what you deem as “unhealthy” interests. When was the last time you took a break? There must be some sort of balance. If there still is an extreme lack of motivation after trying various ways, maybe the things you want to have motivation in just ain’t for you. We can’t force someone to like vanilla ice-cream if they don’t, it’s just weird and unnatural. :)"
"I exercise an ok amount, actually. Primarily weight lifting, but I do occasionally go on walks with my girlfriend. My diet is all sorts of awful however. It’s basically ravioli and ramen noodles at home, then shitty school food. I cant imagine it’s healthy or giving my body everything it needs.  Also I normally drink about 1 1/2 liters of water each day, which isn’t enough still but I don’t think it’s awful. My sleep schedule is also terrible, I basically lay in bed until I can’t keep my eyes open anymore (which is normally around 2am then I wake up at 6am to go to school). "
"I know how hard it can be to bring up stuff like that. I guess it depends on your relationship with your parents. Do you think you could tell them that you’ve been feeling a bit anxious and you think talking to someone might help?  I know it can be hard to say it, so you could leave them a note (maybe add something about not being in immediate crisis if that’s true so they don’t overreact)

It wouldn’t be my first choice, but if you felt you couldn’t bring it up like that, you could say one of your friends said it was helping them and you wanted to see if it would help you too"
"It definitely sounds more like a cry for help than actually wanting to die. Love hurts so I can completely understand why the break up tipped him over the edge especially if there is underlying mental health problems. He is definitely going to need a lot my help than you can provide. All you can do is remind him that you love him, he matters and you are there for him. Also tell him that he needs to want to live for himself. You can’t live for someone else. He needs to get in a better place before he can be in a relationship so he needs to focus on himself not his girlfriend right now."
"That actually means a lot to me. I feel like it's good to have a friend like this as well as technically we are both anonymous, and anonymity cannot be truly judged. I feel that ***so bad***. I feel as though we are similar, when I explain my true self I refer to myself as an extroverted introvert, because although I appear and can make myself extremely extroverted when I want to, deep down I am quite introverted just forcing it out of me. I believe this is because the real me - well, the old me - was truly extroverted. 

I'd like it if I could be there for you too, should you need it. "
"i don't really have it and when i get those moments, they're accompanied by nostalgia. I used to get this more when i was younger but it kind of passed. The childhood memories might be more of a hallucination if they don't make real sense because certain parts of your brain that are connected to older memories, get activated by certain sensory stimulation. I'm not sure if that's the thing that causes it but i guess you could try staying in the present more by trying out new things like tastes and smells. And you should probably quit or at least pause the drugs, they might be causing it."
"Idk it depends on your relationship with these people. How long have you been friends with them? How close are you to them? 

They could have initially been open to the idea but then maybe just felt overwhelmed and didn’t know exactly how to respond to what you wanted to talk about. It’s good to be open with your friends, but at the end of the day your friends aren’t your therapist. 

Maybe the entire group just wasn’t comfortable talking about it in a group chat setting, perhaps just try talking one on one with someone from the group? But again, it depends on how long you’ve known these people, and how deep of a friendship you’ve built thus far. You can’t expect to just meet people and immediately want to dump all your personal issues/feelings on them before building a stable, intimate friendship. And that can take years. "
"She has already tried communicating. Your advice is not productive and is only going to prolong her pain. Therapy costs money that some people don't have and, to echo your words, OP came here looking for a solution, I am pretty sure she's already aware that therapy and the effective communication she has tried are options. 

I strongly encourage her to leave him or avoid him until he acts like an adult. And yes, antagonize and get into an argument about it if she is not at risk of being abused and if they need to argue. I don't really recommend therapy seeing as he has zero interest in listening to her in the first place and seems to not really give a shit about her feelings. Therapy requires people wanting to be there for it to be effective. Though maybe she should seek out therapy just for her to help her to leave him if she needs it. "
"Growing up in a military household can be horrible on a child's mental health, and so can growing up with a parent who is addicted to something.

I wouldn't think of therapy as necessarily getting help but instead getting answers.  Why do you feel the way you do? What methods can you personally use to progress past this.

My SO grew up in a similar situation and ended up diagnosed with BPD. He couldn't find a therapist he didn't mind seeing until he found one that specialized in DBT, basically a sort of therapy that teaches you life skills and how to succeed in life without necessarily all of the head talk.

I on the other hand, need a therapist that specializes in CBT. I need all of that talking and digging into my past and understanding of what's going on in my brain.

I guess what I'm saying is you should dig down and figure out what your goals are, and do some research on who can help you accomplish that best.  A lot of people will just say 'get a psychologist' and expect it to be solved, but their specialties are different just like you wouldn't go to a foot doctor for a sore throat."
"It's only been a day, so it's pretty normal to be upset still. I agree that letting her talk things through might help, but it might be pretty traumatic to hear something like that so think carefully first if you WANT to hear it... If you're not sure, let the counsellor on Monday hear it instead. Apart from talking things over with her, you can also just make sure she's taken care of - make snacks or hot drinks or water available, give her some blankets or something to snuggle up in, maybe put on a movie that she's seen lots of times before (not a big dramatic one, maybe a disney movie or something simple and cartoony). I think if you help her to feel more normal and safe it should help (within reason - don't push her if she wants to be alone, of course). 

Honestly it sounds like you're doing everything you can already. You're keeping her company, suggesting fun easy things, and you're there for her. There isn't much else you can do. Give her time to process everything and to heal a bit, and hopefully she'll be feeling more normal soon. The counsellor will probably be able to help, too. "
"I think it's a necessary part of a rounded and healthy environment - There are many reasons why self-Dx will always be required, mostly based around lack of access to any doctor, let alone good doctors. We can't deny people access to self-examination and answers just because they are, for example, poor, or in a bad location.

I think that it's predominantly on an equal footing with professional Dx, which suffers most of the same flaws - Diagnosticians are, like we are, working from a flawed perspective (theirs external, ours internal), and they, like us, suffer from biases and lack of knowledge that can (depressingly frequently) be extreme.

I do think however that, like professional Dx, it's important to have a filter in place for when it's being done correctly, and to ignore it when it's not. ""I think I have ADHD because I am spacey!"" is no more valid than a professional saying ""It's not autism because you have friends"". Both are a load of rubbish, regardless who's saying them. *All* diagnosis has to be done thoroughly and well and by someone who genuinely knows what they're doing.

Self-Dx is also for personal benefit and for the benefit of your immediate social circle. It is not a stand-in for paper diagnosis, and anyone who acts like it is, who acts like they've been ""officially diagnosed"" because they self-diagnosed, is being an ass."
"After 15 years of suffering with the wrong diagnoses (bipolar), I was reevaluated a few months ago and diagnosed with BPD. I was devastated. I'm still coming to terms with it, but I've learned how to hope where there was no hope before. Think of it this way: now that you know what's wrong, you can get treatment for it and work towards getting better. You've likely been suffering for a long time, and bouncing back from BPD will be the greatest challenge you'll ever face, but the road to recovery is now paved for you. You may never reach its end, and there will be a lot of bumps and detours, but all that's important is that you keep moving. All you have to do is try to be better than you were yesterday. Delays are perfectly fine, too. :)

BPD is an illness that makes us feel everything so very deeply-- negative feelings can incapacitate us. We're angry. We're sad. We're passionate. We're spontaneous. We don't hold back, from one second to the next. But while our emotions get us into trouble more often than not, they also allow us to experience life on a level others can't even fathom. 

I hope you find the strength to not only cope, but embrace who (not what) you are. You are more than your illness. You are more than the sum of your parts. You are a beautiful soul whose light burns brighter than any star in the sky. From one stranger to another, I am proud of you for taking this first step. And you deserve to feel proud of yourself, too!

I know I sound like a refrigerator magnet but I do wish you the best of luck. Don't give up. You've got a lot of people to prove wrong-- including yourself."
"If your mom and sister have/are seeing someone, then I’m sure they’ll definitely understand if you tell them you think it would be good for you to see someone too. You don’t need to be embarrassed to tell them, it’s great that you’re able to recognize in yourself that you haven’t been feeling quite right for a while and want to do something about it. Yea it’ll probably feel awkward trying to tell them, but it’s actually a very mature thing to do and will probably make them proud and thankful that you did. If you’re worried, you could maybe start by writing down a statement that gets out all the main things you want to say and then read it to them to get the conversation started. That’s what I did the last time I needed to let my mom know that I’m still struggling and it’s getting worse and I need her help. It helps me because when I get nervous I forget some of the things I want to say or it doesn’t come out the way I wanted it to or I hesitate and won’t share everything. As soon as you start reading it, it becomes a lot easier to get through your whole statement and it also makes the conversation afterward much easier because you and your family have somewhere to start. Hope this helps! Oh and bring this list of your current feelings you made here to your first appointment! It’s very detailed and I’m sure they’ll find it useful. And don’t worry about googling your symptoms too much in the meantime ☺️ focus on getting your doctor all of the information they need so they can properly diagnose and work with you on making a plan of attack for the future!"
"It sounds a lot like depression from what I can tell, of course, a professional who knows your life would be the one that needs to say this. 

Your guess in it being an outcome of people with depression seems very viable. I myself have struggled with gaining/losing emotions. Hopping between being too anxious and depressed to get out of bed, then immediately to feeling like a sociopath because I can't ""feel"" and everything is empty. In my case, it's a dissociative mindset my brain has taken to because the emotions I faced were too overwhelming. 

Trauma is what brought a majority of my mental health problems, if you suspect you might have experienced trauma I can only suggest professional help. Find a psych that will listen to you, I've gone through 3 before I found one I felt treated me properly. Medication is another concept I struggled with, I didn't want to be perceived as a pill popper or risk being a junkie. Though medication is something I needed to be able to even start my journey to recovery, they don't really ""fix"" your problem, but they give you the strength to work on fixing yourself. Mental health is a battle you have to actively fight, taking pills alone won't necessarily solve it. In your case, your doctor may look for medication that gives you the urge to care enough to get better. 

You will need to find a therapist who you can be completely transparent with, this is my current struggle, and a struggle that a lot of mentally ill people have. It's important to find a therapist you click with, I have gone through more than I can count at this point. But finding that one that you click with will make you realize how important that aspect is during your recovery. Psychiatric hospitals are terrifying, particularly the ones for children, though I will say that my experience with an adult hospital has been very pleasant and I did improve greatly during my in patient stay. There is a lot of stigma around in patient mental hospitals, it's not at all what you think and nothing near how media portrays it. (We got unlimited hot chocolate)

I wish you the best in your journey. Ultimately, you are going to have to be the one who makes the change to get better. You can send someone to therapy and stuff them full of any pills you want, but unless they themselves actually push for the improvement, they will not change. Which is hard when you're so empty that you don't care to change, it took me longer than i can recall to care enough to change. But please, find something that gives you even the smallest amount of motivation to be better. It doesn't matter how small it is, as long as it's a step."
"it’s sort of freaky how similar our stories are. I’m 16 btw. the joint on my jaw is flat which causes the muscles around it to become overworked and painful. I was told that I was tensing my jaw in my sleep because of stress, then I had an x ray and was told the joint was flat, and now when I go to see my specialist he seems to forget that which makes me think he thinks it’s all psychosomatic. it does get worse with stress tho because I clench my teeth when I get upset. it also hurts my neck and shoulder muscles but on top of that my spine curves in more than normal at the bottom (not enough to really notice without it being pointed out) and this causes quite a bit of pain if I’ve been walking for longer than half an hour or if I’ve been standing for a long period of time. the difference with us is that my main pain is in my lower back and I really don’t care about my jaw anymore and I’ve just gotten used to it. 

I don’t know if I’ve ever been happy. I moved from the mainland UK to a smaller island when I was 5. That was when I became extremely shy and about 9 years later I was diagnosed with social anxiety. It caused me to isolate myself but it never bothered me, like you I just played computer games to occupy myself. I’m terrified for my future too but I think we have different reasons for this. I’m terrified that in the future I’ll become isolated again and my mental health will deteriorate further. I just finished my last year of compulsory education and just started an ICT course at a local college but year 10 and 11 I barely came into school. In year 10 I was struggling with anorexia and in year 11 and still now was struggling with various drug addictions. I had a different outlook on my schooling than you, I had 50% attendance last year and got mostly Bs and Cs and I’m perfectly happy with that and don’t feel guilty for people who really applied themselves and got worse marks than me. I didn’t care much what my marks were as long as I could stay in school so I didn’t feel as if I was growing up. That’s another thing that scares me.

Idk how much you know about drugs but it’s impossible to keep a stable mental state when you’re taking amphetamines almost daily at the age of 15. I was taking MDMA every other day on average and about the same amount of dexamphetamine for 3 months while I was meant to be studying for my GCSEs. using MDMA so often depletes serotonin which leads to anxiety depression and irritation and dexamphetamine depletes dopamine causing psychosis so I was basically schizophrenic for a few months. I’m still dependent on drugs in general to motivate myself or feel normal, just not in the same way as you. I’m prescribed the dexamphetamine for the same reason as you, attention problems. dexamphetamine addiction is different to a methylphenidate addiction (I’ve been on ritalin too). amphetamines make you mental. I don’t have any doubt that my current mental state is because if MDMA and dexamphetamine. I need codeine just to feel normal too, I’ve been addicted for the past few months. my drug use is in a completely different league to yours but it is a contributing factor to my mental state. methylphenidate as I’ve said is completely different to amphetamines, it is addictive but it won’t permanently and severely damage your mental health. 

I would say the two of us deal with our problems differently and are affected by them differently. I try to go out with friends as much as possible to take my mind off of everything, I watch hours of youtube videos and tv a day to occupy myself and I barely sleep. I don’t need drugs to be with my friends but I need drugs to cope with being alone. 

well I’ve never been through something as horrible as the situation you described with a member of your family trying to take their own life and I’m sorry. It would be wrong to say we’re going through something similar but we are both having family problems. my mum is paranoid schizophrenic and can’t work can’t afford her own house and lives with my sister. my dad is an alcoholic and is unemployed as well and because of the amount of money he spends on drink we have a very low quality of living. I get into arguments with my dad a lot and he’s kicked me out a few times for no reason other than he felt like it. I’ve gotten into physical fights with him as well. sometimes I feel as if I’m exaggerating my situation because I find it strangely easy to deal with. I tell the truth to people and they act all morbid and my psychiatrist even wants me to go into care and I don’t understand if they’re seeing it how it is. I second guess myself on whether or not I’m trying to get attention. I suppose that’s similar to feeling guilty about your family member although I’m not saying I have any guilt on my mind, just that we both must question ourselves about what’s happened to us. 

I’ve lost most of my interests too. I stopped being interested in computer games years ago and I did used to write poetry too but I can’t find the motivation to even get my head to work to write something down. I mostly just listen to music and sit in the living room, sometimes message people but the social anxiety gets in the way but like you, despite having a social disability, I much more prefer to talk to people than spend time alone. 

I generally don’t care about my performance in school etc but I am by all means a complete narcissist so I don’t worry about things like that. 

I just though I’d share with you my story since they’re pretty similar , make you feel less alone in this. it’s impossible to say if everything will blow over. sometimes it does sometimes it doesn’t but what I’ll say and I know I’m going to sound like a cunt and I’m sorry for that but if you haven’t thought about killing yourself you’re probably not in too deep with your mood difficulties. it would be perfectly normal to have some kind of post trauma after the incident with your family member and going to therapy could help. my personal plan for what I’m going to do if things suddenly take a turn for the worse is just to check myself into a mental hospital. "
"Every sacrifice of money adds up, $10 here $15 there it slows down your progress. "
Get yourself to a psychiatrist. This sounds suspiciously like bipolar with mania.
Have you tried listening to relaxing music whilst falling asleep? This may help :)
"He’s not a stoner, he barely inhaled when he took a single hit off that banger. "
I first started I was gonna do my wrist but tryed somewhere else first just to see
I hope you feel better soon and find out why your body isn't reacting well to it.
I see a doctor. I'm on medicine right now. I've got another appointment next week.
I'm in a re-education camp and can't get out. I'm not allowed to think for myself.
I'm pretty sure I have a reactive field around me. I think people act differently.
"Keep talking man, keep today stuff out of your head and be safe. You're not alone."
Luckily we're within an hour of a semi-major city so I will look that way. Thanks!
Most universities offer free counseling. Maybe try to check out those resources.
Other meds that work along with Zoloft is lorazepam but thatll be only for 3 moths
Schizophrenia often includes paranoia. This definitely sounds like schizophrenia.
"Sorry to hear about your attempts and recent harming, wish you the best 
Thank you"
Thank you! If I don’t feel better later this evening I may take you up on that.
Thank you. I’ve been reading up on articles all day. Feeling a lot less lonely.
Thanks so much! I will definitely think about these questions and write some down.
Thanks! I wasn't sure if it was helping but I upped her dose so I hope that helps.
That depends. Do you have health insurance through somebody? Or possibly Medicaid?
Try emotional reactivity or emotional overwhelm. DBT skills are helpful for this.
Yeah I was suggested EDMR and I got a bad feeling about it. Thanks for your input!
You just implied that i’m ignorant whilst interpreting what I said incorrectly.
You may want to cross post over on r/legaladvice. Pretty sure that’s not legal.
"and you sound like a poser angsty emo kid, so i guess there’s a theme going on. "
"now i realize that i have ""harm OCD"" as well . thank you. thats one helpful video "
this. BPD is something you can conquer and cure. Bipolar is a death sentence lol.
" I actually went to a free service for young people struggling with mental health before, but ironically because I told them that I had suicidal thoughts they ""could not offer me their services"". I never followed up but I think I will look into maybe seeing a private therapist, even if it is expensive. I appreciate the reply, thank you "
"Dont be afraid to communicate more with your therapist if you feel that your mom being there makes it hard to have open expression, if it is an issue perhaps communicate more with your mom about feeling how you cant express yourself it could be intimidating but you gotta communicate these kinds of things and it could help your dynamic. "
"Hey. Here’s my experience.

I was really resistant to “needing” them. I think it was also a false self esteem/ego thing. But I already had poor self esteem. 

It took some experimenting but I have a regimen now that I feel allows me to naturally have higher self esteem, more energy, and more motivation than my non-medicated self. "
"I like to schedule pleasant activities for myself after doing a lot of work, and add ""fun"" elements to un-fun activities. So after a long day at work or studying for school, I'll carve time out for myself to draw, journal, or read. For activities I dislike, such as household chores, I listen to podcasts, or play music and dance it out. "
"I never really figured out how to be normal.
I've observed weirdos that made me grateful I was not them.
I wouldn't want to be normal. Most normal people have an average IQ. Mine is 136.
I am good at lots of things, I have friends and family that love me.
If I used the term 'normal' for myself, I would soon experience an identity crisis"
"I'm thinking maybe because I'm work too long. I work Monday to Saturday. 7am to 6 pm. But other people have it worse, 2 jobs 3 jobs. Well for support or acceptance, my brothers and their wives are okay. We see each other everyday. Don't really talk about personal stuff. We have our family and friends for that. Don't really feel lonely. "
"It might sound weird but more good might come out of this breakup then bad, A lot of men will read this post and the story you told and really take it under advisement for themselves. [something GOOD always comes from something bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8) Chins up guys, You're always more important then you think. "
"Oh wow you were right. People are way too pro-self-diagnosis here.

Guys researching and understanding your disease is cool and important, but the trick is to not get attached to a diagnosis to the point where you distort your views on your symptoms until they fit the criteria for a disorder that you’ve made up your mind about having."
"So, I guess we'll see in the following days. It's morning, I'm here at work and I feel mildly excited. I also didn't feel much groggy getting out of bed earlier unlike usual, and I have slept around 6 hours. Tomorrow I'll get a leave of 13 days, so I hope to keep this energy for as long as possible and put it to good use with my family."
"Sometimes your body can build up a tolerance against medication over time, it might be an idea to speak with your doctor and see if the dosage needs to be upped or possibly changing altogether, meanwhile see if there's anything you can do to improve your mood like going to the gym or just trying to spend more time with friends or family"
"Talk to yourself in the mirror. Look yourself in the eye and tell yourself that you are smart, strong and kind. Tell yourself ""I love you."" Often we need (or have needed in the past) to hear things that others can't or don't tell you. This is a great way to give yourself whatever support you need. It works best if you use second person."
"completely agree- especially with the war thing. my grandfather fought in Korea when he was just a teenager. he never spoke about what happened there afterwards, to anybody. not his wife, his kids, his siblings, or me. of course being in a war and ptsd affect everyone differently, but bragging about shooting somebody? very very strange "
"Hmm what is your diet like when you are bulking? What kind of exercises are you doing?
I have had similar issues with body image as I have always been the gangly skinny kid so when I bulk I feel good but after a while if I stop visibly growing I think I look to small.
Body dysmorphia is incredibly common in the fitness world and I feel like I should warn you from experience that steroid use will make you even more image obsessed.

Best of luck to you man, sometimes it helps me just to focus on how strong I feel instead of look, if I feel like I am gaining strength then I am happy �� "
"I agree with this. I am also a recovering alcoholic, and I have been sober for 2 years now. I found that it didn't make me happier...it just made me forget for a few minutes, then I felt awful for another day after that (unless I kept the drinking going, which I have done, hence how I became an alcoholic). Once I started facing the issues that were causing me to drink, I realized that I don't need that to numb myself out. I eventually realized that things weren't as bad as I'd thought and that there was no reason to run.  


I hope you can work through the issues and feel better soon. :)"
"I am a self-harmer and I can relate. It is so hard to resist that urge...the pain is such a comfort because when I need to self-harm, I am usually in a state where I can't feel much, and that pain so sharp and concrete, allows me to feel again...and cry. I SO understand you. When I was hospitalized for suicide attempts (mind you, this was only about 50 miles from home) I got so terribly homesick that I had to be given anti-anxiety meds, which I still need to take.   


I hope you feel better. If you need to chat, I am here. I know the feelings associated with self-harm. Good luck to you."
"I got diagnosed when I was in elementary school so didn't really understand what it meant, other than ""you're different, that is why nobody likes you and why you can't act normal."" (Normal is probably the wrong way to put it but that's how I felt, sorry for clumsy phrasing) 

I remember being angry, sad, and generally against it on all levels. Became happy when they said it would disappear as I grew older and ""matured."" Looking back at that time and trying to analyse the whole situation today, I'd say it was overall a negative experience, however, today I'm glad they diagnosed me early. "
"I have been battling depression for 3 decades or more. It keeps coming back and then goes away. What does it mean about you as a person? That you are human. You have a disease or disorder or whatever they are classifying Depression as now (it changes so much!) and that is OK. Hell, I have Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, a history of self-harm, Alcoholism, Anorexia Nervosa, and now I was just diagnosed with Pyromania. I think I have enough problems for my whole state lol.   


It's ok to not be ok...and I want you to know that I am here for you if you need to talk. :)"
"If I werent aware of how debilitated I get withOUT antipsychotics. If I hadnt gone through weeks of hospitalization, years of treatment, and extensive counseling. If I did not know the impact a life without antipsychotics would have on me, you might as well have talked me out of taking a severely important medication.  It took me 3 years to actually get myself to take medication.

I have a disability. A disability. Because of my condition, and speaking in a tone about antipsychotics like I shouldnt take them is a horrible move on your part, ESPECIALLY as someone involved in health care. "
"If you go to unl, there’s the heath center there helped me out greatly. I started seeing a therapist and she eventually recommended me to see a psychiatrist to get some medication. 

Don’t be afraid to get help, your family should be happy that you’re trying to feeling happy and healthy after you get help. Even so, you don’t have to tell your family about it. It can all be very personal to you and just your own path. My family doesn’t know I see a therapist or I am on antidepressants either but at this point, I feel better so I don’t really have shame in it if they find out. "
"May I remind you that you do you have family, a son.  While you may have a poor relationship with your family, would it be safe to assume that you and your son love each other?  

I know how you feel when you say you are tired of waking up every morning.  It would be easier to not wake up.  I'm sorry you're going through this, and that you feel this way.  

How does it feel to get that out of your system, and to know that you've been heard?  Something tells me you are a fighter.  You kinda told me/us yourself: you tried therapy, meds, church.  Do you want to live but not know how?       "
"what helped me was this. my workday was kind of the same every day. so i got angry at the same things. i noticed and everytime before i got in the situation i stopped and said to myself. ""i will not get angry at this, its no use anyway"" then i would confront the situation, and everytime i felt the anger boiling up i pushed it to the side and do my best to stay calm. be realistic about it and dont be beat down if you maybe did get angry but look forward to the next test. it helped me.

edit 1: its just metally preparing yourself for a situation that might come so you dont get overwhelmed."
"Hey! You have this defined issue, I know what you're feeling. I swear my anxiety makes up 99% of who I am, to the extent where I also struggle with sleep. My insecurities have caused me to lash out, I am diagnosed bipolar (not sure if that's the BPD you mean, bipolar and borderline get confused a lot under 'BPD')  

It sounds like there may be more than GAD bothering you. I identify with the manipulative behaviors you described during my mixed episodes, as well as the terrifying struggle of ""socializing"" and the god forsaken concept of eye contact. BPD seems like a very viable diagnosis, ultimately, you will need to find a professional to make that call. Labels aside, the help and treatment is what's really important. You seem like a very self aware person who is willing and ready to change, so you shall. I wish you the best of luck &lt;3"
"I hadn't. I go to school here, and work here, and I need the parking spot our unit provides. Also, everywhere I can find that is leasing is too far away. My friends don't have spare rooms, and with my cat I can't just stay on a couch or anything. I also would have to move away from the stray cats I feed, and I doubt that would be kept up in my absence.

He has less stuff than me (he's not a student so doesn't have 50 lbs of text books and anoyher 10 lbs of school supplies), doesn't have a car, and has friends who live closer to his work than where we are. They already let him crash at their places when he refuses to come home or gets too drunk to come home, so I would imagine it's not too much more of a leap.

The only option I can see is petitioning the school to let me have on-campus housing, but that seems pretty unlikely this late on."
"Of course his mental condition doesn't justify it, but that doesn't mean I should be reckless with the knowledge that he tends to have very aggressiv behavior. And I know how he is in a situation like that, I don't want to risk anything. We are both quiet young, we both still have problems coping with situations and our behavior.

Well, I only told have of the story of my roommates, because the other things doesn't involve my mental health but my spinal injury, so I though it would be very off topic, but they also threw my crutches down the stairs and out the window, refuse to let me sit down down on the kitchen table when I need some rest, cut down my straws that I need for drinking because I have very floppy wrists, etc. Of course this is asshole behavior. But its asshole behavior on cost of my mental health, safety and comfort in life."
"Well my other doctors would take like six weeks at a time to get me up to dosage. They would the taper off for six weeks. They also just wanted me to be not depressed and didn’t care if I was happy. She would take 4 weeks and always mix in small amounts of other drugs that she thought would work with my chemistry. She is extremely intelligent though and very experienced. I’m actually on a drug that isn’t even meant for depression. It’s meant for people with seizures but it works very similar to anti depressants. She said “ this is not an anti depressant but I want you to try it, I know this sounds weird but I think it might work for you.” This was also after I took a drug that made me want to die. But I trusted her and said ok. Best choice I made. I also take another drug with it. A very small dose but it’s changed my life. "
"Yeah, I definitely do beat myself up.  I do talk to my boyfriend.  He's going to counseling and she's a trauma counselor.  So, I'm currently checking to see if she will take my insurance and will try her out.  I've never specifically seen a trauma counselor even though I've got the traumas.  (edit:  and I've seen many, MANY counselors...but none for very long and none who seemed to really help my issues)

I think being misunderstood is akin to the world ending for me, since my mother never understood me (she was a narcissist).  And since she was causing me such pain but didn't understand where it was coming from (even though I told her many times) it freaks me out when people don't understand me.  I've gotten better over the years, but I just figured this out yesterday.   Misunderstood=EVERYTHING IS BAD AND GOING TO GET WORSE in my brain."
"I had a similar experience when about a month ago I was diagnosed bipolar and like you thought I just had recurring depression issues my whole life 

At first it freaked me out bc my dad had full blown BP (and refused any medication) and made my life unbearably crazy as a kid and I’d sworn never to do anything like that to other people even though it wasn’t his fault. I was going down a really dark place for a bit. 

What has helped me since is weekly meetings with my psychologist, who luckily I think is really good and supportive, especially that now that we understand my condition better we can be better at treating it (after all it’s been there the whole time). This has prompted me to switch away from antidepressants and to take a mood stabilizer and after a few weeks I feel better than I have in a really long time. 

Diagnosis = better ability to apply the right treatment

I’m sure it doesn’t feel that why right now, but it’s only your knowledge that has changed, not your body/brain, and that will hopefully help your doctors find more effective treatments. 

Hope this helps"
"I personally wouldn't get one because first, my mental illnesses aren't life-threatening. When I am anxious, it is all internal and I am unsure if it shows on the outside at all. Secondly, I don't know that I would want to broadcast that I am a Pyromaniac to anyone outside being anonymous on the internet. I can just IMAGINE the stigma that would get me. Yikes. I have enough trouble accepting it myself, and I feel like everyone is looking at me and knows anyhow when I am out in public. Noone will come near me for fear that I will burn them up. That is ridiculous, of course, but I know how ignorant society is already about mental health in general, so no thanks. My son did have one because he had Nephrotic Syndrome (kidney disease) that kept him in and out of the hospital from ages 3-6 or so. He needed one in case he started showing symptoms that the protein in his urine was too high and in his body too low. He would get swelling in the face and stomach, not want to eat or play, and just look and act ill. That was a hard time for us to go through. :) That is just my opinion on the bracelets."
"Yeah, I got better.   12-18 was rough but I got through.  19-21 was good times.  22-28 depression really started to take over my life.  29-36 times were terrible.  37 to current, I'm doing alright.  There's still bad days, but now, there's a lot of moments that aren't bad.

Couple suggestions:

Stress, hating being somewhere, resenting a commitment - it's all soul-crushing.  The good news is that you know if you didn't have all this weight on your shoulders, you'd be fine.   If you lived out in a cabin in the woods somewhere with a significant other, some good friends, and no responsibilities, you know you would feel great internally.

So, just keep in mind your external circumstances are what's making your mentality and inner-workings get pushed down even further.    Take a step back,  figure out what you really want at this moment, tomorrow, in life, and then take a look to see what you can do to head towards that.

Also, schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist and see if they recommend a medication.  You don't have to take it, but see what they suggest. (Cymbalta works great for me)"
"You are not alone in the slightest. There are a lot of people like you that feel emotion as deeply and intensely as you. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and feeling intense emotions and emotional dysregulation is the hallmark symptom of it. Not saying that you have BPD, or anything. I look at it like there are a subset of us who have this innate strong sense of emotion, and those who are given the proper environment and skills go on to be able to manage it throughout life without too much trouble. However, those of us that experience trauma, an invalidating environment, and/or aren't taught the proper skills tend to have trouble managing our intense emotions later on, resulting in things like BPD. If you're struggling with intense emotions and feeling like you're absorbing the emotions of those around you, I would highly recommend Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). It teaches you those skills needed to manage these intense emotions that we unfortunately were not taught due to whatever circumstances. If you don't want to enroll in an actual therapy program, there are DBT workbooks that you can buy on Amazon that you can work on yourself even. I'd recommend *The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook* as a start. *DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets* if you wanted something a bit more in depth. Best of luck to you. "
"Although it seems bad now, it sounds to me like you're catching this ""early"", before it gets really out of hand.

The right medication could be what you need. It seems like external factors might not be responsible because you have made a lot of effort to improve your lifestyle but it had no real impact.

Therapy usually helps as well. Often there are things going on that cause depression that you can't identify without somebody to walk you through things and help you look at them a bit more objectively. It's easy to take things for granted and assume they're not a problem simply because you've lived with them for so long.

So I would advise you to stay open minded - maybe you just need some medication to get you back on track, or maybe there's a thing in your life causing this without you realising. Getting professional help is the best way to figure it out.

Not wanting to read too much into what you said but when you say that you get along with your wife well, is there anything more to it than that? I mean, do you still love her, have a healthy sex life, etc.? You don't have to answer me; they're just questions you should ask yourself with an open mind. If there are problems in your marriage that you're ignoring then marital counseling could really help. Better to fix it now before it's too late.

Anyway, it's good that you're looking for help and asking with humility - that's the most important step to getting better. And getting better is achievable, so continue with this attitude and you should be back on your feet soon.

Good luck and well done for finding the courage to ask for help."

Thank you for posting this - very informative. I will definitely do some research.
Thanks for your kind words and advice. I will certainly give those things a try. :)

"If you need help, get help. Seeking medical and therapeutic help can and does work so it's worth a try before you do something drastic.

"AAAH! Another mate from Down Undah! I have another friend also in Australia, and it is so weird because I only get to talk to her at certain times of my day since she is 14 hours ahead of me lol. You are literally in my future ahhahaha. :)

My walk wasn't as eventful today as it was yesterday. I only had one time where I had to actively control myself. There was a shopping cart full of newspapers, and I had the REALLY strong urge to light it all on fire. I stopped myself because well...I would have gotten caught and I didn't want to go to jail. Sigh. This disorder is a bitch on wheels. :("
"Fist off I am no doctor, therapist or expert. 
Did he have something traumatic happen in his childhood, abuse or neglect?  I know that having kids can bring out unprocessed emotions from childhood trauma.  Seeing how he left very quickly after you had your child and seemed to change overnight seems like a flight response.  Maybe get him to a therapist that specializes in pstd.  

You sound very rational and have been thoughtful about this. He is very lucky to have you in his life. I don’t know if I’d react in such a patient, loving, way.  

Good luck, I hope he gets the help he needs."
"Honestly, I personally don't relate exactly with what you're going through but it sounds sucky. I'm sorry OP ]: 

I've learned that intrusive thoughts can be part of OCD and/or anxiety especially if they are unwanted and persistent. I actually get them to but in different forms. I understand how disturbing they can be and how frustrating it can be dealing with those thoughts. 

I'm not a professional though so don't quote me on it. It's great to hear you are in recovery for bulimia though. Any journey towards recovery isn't going to be the easiest road and I commend you for seeking help! "

It didn’t hurt at all! This is my first tat and I was indecisive where I wanted it. I was debating whether to put it on my left wrist, my left forearm or index finger. Out of nowhere I was like um wait how would I look with it on my back LMAO I was like let’s go back it is and BAM it happened. My tat artist was amazing though. So sweet and helpful. Also, good luck with your next tat! Thank you for making my entire upcoming week with your kind words!"
"I suffered from Anorexia a few years ago, but my diet now is...pretty normal. I don't eat a lot of junk food and we eat out at restaurants only in the beginning of the month. Otherwise, it is all home-cooked meals. I am overweight but that is because my diet when I was drinking was crap. I gained a ton of weight and it is not coming off as easily. I am 47 so it seems to want to stick around. Lucky me. I walk 2-1/2 miles every school day. Once summer comes, I am still active, but I don't walk anymore. I don't like heat. :) I am pretty healthy besides high calcium in my blood and low iron. "
"I'm not a native speaker, so sorry for eventual errors. 
You should visit a therapist. I know it is hard to reach out for help, but it's worth it. It took me one and a half year after my decision to visit a therapist to actually really visit a therapist but it was the right decision. In most cases we know the first steps to heal/or get better but we hesitate because of our toxic mindset. I'm not healed and I don't know if that will ever happen, but I work really hard to feel better and I am proud because I had the courage to seek for help... I hope you'll find help and you'll get better. "
"Thank you. I feel like I’ve bottled up a lot of situations up that have happened to me in the recent year. &amp; I’m starting to think I can’t cope with everything. I’m trying to decide whether it’s a good idea or not, for me to talk to someone who doesn’t know me personally, who can’t rightfully judge me for decisions and such things that have happened. I just feel like I need that same outcome you have been receiving. The will to move on and move forward. And helping me keep my head above the water. I need the positivity. I will for sure look into therapy. Thank you again."
"When you reach climax your body releases chemicals to make you feel a little bit relaxed, but not in any extreme way, so I think that your problem is two-fold. First yes you have probably done it enough times that it has become somewhat of a habit for you and secondly the chemicals released helps you a bit too. I would suggest not masturbating before bed until you have no problems sleeping again. As to whether or not to tell your doc it's really up to you. I would probably do it, just to be safe, but I wouldn't expect any solution other than stop doing it before bed, until you can sleep. "
"For the record, I feel a lot more happy and successful now at 22 than I did at 20 (which was a low point for me mental health-wise). Who knows what I’ll have going on by the time I’m 24? And you have possibilities available to you as well. Maybe being in therapy will help you pursue them.

I totally understand where you’re coming from, though. I’m still in undergrad as a result of having to take some time off and transfer due to mental health issues, and that often makes me feel like I’m way behind. Last semester the instructor for my Philosophy class was a grad student who was maybe 2 years older than me (and also incredibly beautiful, while I kind of look like a troll). I definitely felt and inferiority complex there, but she was a great teacher and I loved the class. Your therapist may be similarly skilled despite being young."
"Life isn't perfect and everyone should already be used to it, crying or blaming someone won't help in any way. If you ask me I'd say your parents were selfish blaming you for your illness and now you are completely right saying that your mum is being irrational blaming your father's death on you. You shouldn't feel guilty at all. I know it must be hard for you but there's nothing you did wrong. 

I feel like your parents are kind of similar to mine. I've been struggling with mental issues almost my whole life but I didn't tell my parents because I knew they would react like your and probably be ashamed of me. Now I can see the impact it had on me. I'm not sure if I regret it now but I feel like every parent should know what their kid is going through and if they can't accept it I don't think so they are ready to be parents. It's almost like playing in the lottery and later complain that you didn't win the grand prize which symbolize the perfect life in this cate. 

I hope you'll get better and please don't feel guilty because of your father's death.

EDIT: added extra spaces for readability"
"DBT therapist here.... first it sounds like you have made tremendous progress in DBT. A backslide doesn’t erase that. You get to continue to make choices to use skills to be more effective in your life. Progress is never linear. Backslides are expected and seen as opportunities for growth in DBT, ie”what can we do differently next time?”  Remember with the backslide you’re likely experiencing what we call the emotional vortex. This means you experienced high emotional arousal, used a behavior when it was not tolerable, felt relief, then shame, embarrassment etc. So, get to basics with mindfulness notice your self judgments, problem solve with the trouble shooting handouts and worksheets (assuming you’re using Linehan’s material), and revisit the self validation skills. Use flexible thinking, this is a blip on the radar in the bigger picture and a temporary set back. It does not have to be permanent, but you get to make the choice on how to proceed and one of those options is to not use skills and make things worse. That is always an option and it sounds like you’re more motivated and insightful then making that choice. Lastly, complete a chain analysis of the incident with your therapist to gain insight into what led up to the behavior. Chain analysis are tough, but worth it- they’re not meant to be punitive. You got this!!! "
"Well it could be invalidating if everyone with a mental illness was met with ‘you’re just identifying with your illness, that’s why you have it and don’t want it to go’, so I understand what your classmate is saying but on the other hand her choice of words ‘invalidating my experience’ kinda implies ‘you’re invalidating me’. I feel like she’s taken it personally which is always going to hint at ego/identity. She probably thinks that this stance would result in no one wanting to understand or help her but I don’t think this is true. It’s not that people think she’s lying or faking, just that there’s a layer to the problem that might be blocking her from making improvements. I do think people identify with their feelings a lot, even people without mental illnesses. I have a friend with low self esteem and she constantly paints it as a personality trait of hers that she can’t change, which I actually think it a defence because she doesn’t want to face the problem. I have a suspicion that part of her issue is her parents (shocker) but she always tries to convince everyone how great they are, so there’s potentially a huge disconnect there that she’s trying to avoid. I think sometimes the ‘this is who I am’ belief is a tactic of sorts. That doesn’t mean the persons problems/feelings aren’t real though."
"I would urge you to not let one person's bad experience hinder you from getting help you need. for every one person who has a terrible time with side effects, there are hundreds it helps. And if you have the right doctor, they will be sure to monitor and schedule check in appointments to make sure you are on a medication that works and are on the right dosage. you also have to realize that it takes a few weeks for the medicine to actually work. 

I will touch on the not so positive that I have experienced

1. Being tired all the time- I would say that on periods where I am on medication, I tend to be a lot more tired and go to sleep earlier, but it has never been so bad that I can't function during the day. It just means I go to bed a lil earlier most nights which like, not a bad thing
2. Drinking. I was in college the last four years and was on medication during like 1 1/2 years of it. Went to a school with a big drinking culture. You have to be REALLY careful when drinking and being on antidepressants, like SO careful. I would go to socials and get drunk off of literally 2 drinks and then be confused until I remembered I was on medication that lowered my tolerance. It's advised not to drink at all. 
3. forgetting a dose- if you forget a dose, you will notice that your body will kinda recognize that immediately, and the anxiety will start to kick in. be diligent with taking it and at the same time. 

Despite all of the above, I will always say the medication is worth it. It has allowed me to be more calm and cope and not be a hysteric mess all the time. It keeps my mind from racing so much. "

"I’ve never had jealousy or control issues myself but I could probably benefit from schema therapy in other ways. No, I’ve never done schema therapy by myself or with a therapist. I would encourage you to at least read about the different schemas if you can’t afford therapy, but it would be better and more effective with a therapist "
"The hardest step is always starting. There's really no trick to push yourself to start, you just need to say ""Ok. I'm tired of suffering. I need my problems to end. I can do this."" Sorry that's not the best answer, but it's the only one I have. And trust me, if you don't take that first step than its gonna get worse before it gets better."
"Then it sure sucks to be you, asshole.

Either something bad happened to you, and a therapist can try to help you process it, or (as you've said repeatedly here) the very notion of sexual assault is ""feminist bullshit"" and nothing bad happened to you.

Pick one.

Either you matter, or (as you've repeatedly said here) you don't.

Pick one."
"You’re really ignorant and pushing an issue you know nothing about. You’re passing judgment on people, specifically children. 
Autism in the brain actually appears as an INCREASE of synapses, not a decrease of brain function as you are implying. Please begin to cite your sources about your brainstem theory. Real research , real talk. "
"not really something you can probably do much about directly, but I would certainly be talking to them about it, expressing concern, and encouraging them to get a proper medical assessment. That extent of memory loss, is at best 'unusual' in someone that age, who should really be at peak for simple memory tasks. Its concerning, for sure. "
"I used to suffer from anxiety around death and the end of the world. Similar to this. I would constantly be thinking of it. 

It's not healthy to be constantly thinking of it as it effects your day to day life. I would see a doctor. 

Also, perhaps researching to find some sort of solace could help, perhaps philosophical and scientific stuff. Nietzsche talks a lot about how we need to give our life meaning. Find what makes you happy. Richard Dawkins too has some good quoted about life and how lucky we are to be alive so we should enjoy it. Idk this sort of stuff ( and medication) helps me "
"I was a university TA. A student asked the teacher to be excused from an assignment after the fact because she had been struggling with depression.  The teacher said she'd be happy to do that, but the student would need to speak to a counselor or doctor and get an official diagnosis and a list of accommodations needed for this class. The student never did anything about it. I think situations like this make a lot of professors skeptical about helping students. That's why I think a better system, like we have for dyslexia or other learning disabilities,  would benefit students and teachers."
"I'm no pro or anything, but it's okay to feel like shit and not be productive. Let the mess be the mess for now, throw on your most comfy pj's and watch a good tearjerker with your favorite comfort food. Have a cry, let is out, really it's okay to be sad. Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow and actually feel like taking a shower, maybe not. You don't owe anyone anything. Take the time you can to maybe write out some of the issues your dealing with. That always help me stop the crazy thought loop.

You're gonna be okay. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it's okay to not be okay today. "
"Thank you for this reply! I study human development myself so I had been wondering if it was an attachment disorder but I know I’m not educated enough on the subject to be sure of it. My grandparents, brother and I have tried the school route; unfortunately our father has not given any of us visitation or guardian rights re: her school, so we personally can’t talk to her teachers. We tried getting my sister to do it herself but she essentially told us hell no. My stepmom might be able to convince my dad, I’ll definitely speak to her about it. Is there any more information about ODD? "
"I havent deleted any of my comments, mate. Unless it was an accident.

I was only insulted when I was being spoken down to. I really dont want to debate, I really dont. I didnt come to debate. And I was glad you answered my question about depression, thank you for that.

And this isnt about you and your free time. If you come to a support community to debate people in need of help, you need to get some things straight: It is dangerous to come to a community if mentally ill people and look to argue. I don't care about your free time.

Taking it from me, a person who is significantly depressed, is not happy to debate when they already have a lot on their mind. In fact, it hinders self esteem and brings up negative thoughts, harmful thoughts. If you want to debate, dont come to, what should be a safe community, of mentally ill people to do it."
"Sometimes we assume we should do things because society says so, but actually we don't want it bad enough for ourselves. If you have no motivation, maybe you don't really want it for now, but maybe you will in the future. You should at least have some intrinsic (i.e. self-development) or extrinsic (i.e. paying bills, otherwise you won't survive) motivation to get you going.That's what I learned from my therapy.

I struggle with this too. I think for now, I'm too aware about the pointlessness of life and that having an impact across decades is so rare, that I can't undo this perspective and just.. do it, if I don't enjoy it while doing it. (Not that I like doing laundry or dishes, but that's just necessary for my own wellbeing). I know aspirations and goals change, so I take it day by day. Sadly there's no magic cure (except for meds, maybe)"
"Thank you for your response. I do apologize for not including a content warning. I'm new to reddit. 

You certainly made a good point about R possibly always having been an abuser. I don't know him or L well enough to say anything to the contrary, but I do know that they've been together for several years. 

I'm concerned that R is having a mental health crisis because of his bizarre and unpredictable behavior. I didn't add this in the original post because it's a very specific example, but this morning, R showed up at our work pushing 2 shopping carts filled with garbage. According to my co-worker who was here, R pushed his shopping carts up to the entrance of our building, told our co-worker ""I'm just here to take a shit"", went into the bathroom, then walked out of the building and walked away, leaving the shopping carts on our property.

"i was diagnosed with aspergers when i was younger and it’s affected me in many different ways over the years, i could go on in detail but i’ll keep it relatively short, as a kid i really struggled socially, i didn’t understand the other kids and was very quiet unless i felt very comfortable with that person. the main thing is i don’t understand things the way everyone else does, this woman with the same mental disorder said “it’s like everyone else has been handed a guide book except for you” i relate to that so deeply. another thing is that i get stuck into freeze cycles, where i want to something but mentally i’m unable and then i shut down and it can never end sometimes. also i have a horrific temper because of it, it’s a pretty mysterious condition still so there’s probably a horde of unknown ways it effects people. "
"I physical symptoms like the neck twitch and restless legs got better as time went on being on the meds. It kinda just fades away as the meds work in your system, which you will absolutely start to feel the meds building in your system. I got way more anxious too because I honestly thought something was wrong with me, but nope. Your body has to catch up and realize you aren't waiting for danger, you don't need to be tense and in fight or flight.... As for why I stoppeed taking the meds, I started to feel numb. With Lexapro it started to numb me to everything when I'm typically very sensitive. I also was having trouble in the bedroom. But, not only this, I simply felt like the meds ran their course. My life had calmed down quite a bit, I moved out, etc. So I weened myself off of it by half a dose for 1 week, half a dose every other day, then stopped taking it altogether. And to be quite honest with you, I've never felt better. The ""Reset"" button definitely was hit on my brain. A diet change would also help quite a bit, sugar and carbs make anxiety a living hell. Consider this for yourself. ;)"
"They will admit you if you need help. You don't have to be suicidal. I showed up to a doctor's appointment depressed, unwashed, unable to sort out the basics of life and they brought me right over. I wasn't suicidal but I was a wreck. And two weeks in the psych ward helped tremendously. They fed me, washed my clothes, made sure I didn't stay in bed all day (without judgment, just gentle encouragement), encouraged me to shower, fixed my meds, talked to my landlord, everything I couldn't manage for myself was taken care of. It was actually like a nice holiday.

I'm very thankful for that. When I checked out, my head was much clearer and I could rejoin real life.

This was in the US but I'm sure it is the same anywhere. 

Edit: There are also outpatient and partial hospitalization programs if you need help but don't want to stay the night. You usually go to the hospital for about 8 hours a day, see a therapist and a psychiatrist daily, as well as intensive group programs. This might be a good fit for you. They usually run 7 - 10 days with some places offering up to 30 days. 

Good luck to you! "

Don't overreact. She stated healthy aspirations. She just needs to be kindly educated
"Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap in the shower smells so great, always lifts my spirits."
Her family let her down. She told them what she was going to do and they ignored her.
I believe this is up for debate. I think you need to be susceptible to it to get it.

Yeah I’m no expert but this sounds a little like how bipolar disorder can manifest.
Yeah lol I thought I have special power that can see future reddit post or something.
"Yes, absolutely. Those are common themes for people with sz to become obsessed with. "
You can have a virtual hug from me &lt;3 if you ever need to talk my PM's are open :)
You will have to see if they are in your network. Most of this is going to be on you.
it really does. its nice to have support and its scary to think you could lose that.
my wife and mother were very toxic. i couldn't get better living with either of them.

I hope you get to talk to someone soon, it sure helped me a lot!

"Generally, the only way these are covered is if you are declared mentally incompetent. Most the time, people don’t want to do this because then they can’t make decisions for themselves or sign there own paperwork. If you really want to go down this road, the first step to disability, no matter the reason, is to get a disability lawyer."
"I can totally identify with this. It's rare to see what I feel put into words so well, and it makes me feel a bit better knowing I'm not the only one who feels like that. 

I've felt a lot better since quitting caffeine, I've found it really does fuel my anxiety. My advice, take it however you like, is to give up coffee and see if it helps"
"I looked it up, but I don't feel like I have episodes where my mood is noticeably elevated. I can't tell if it's just my anxiety and it brings me down every once in awhile or if there's a bigger underlying issue. I think I'm gonna try a free week on BetterHelp to see if I can better understand what may be going on. Thank you for the input!"
"I think the same thing. Or at least I have in the past. ""Why me?"" is something that's gone through my head a lot over the past few years. But if you don't do anything about it right now, it's only going to continue to get worse. And I can tell you that from my own personal experience. Do this right now or you'll regret it later on in life."

"My insurance company had a list of people within a certain radius of me. I looked up a few people online, read their  profile and what type of therapy they provide.

"One big upvote for you.  


I don't think there is anything you can do for my...""issue"" . I have Depression under control, my Anxiety is pretty bad but right now it is OK...the other issues I have are in the past. The one that is bugging me can't be helped by talking. I appreciate what you're doing though. &lt;3 I think it is wonderful. :)"
"Thank you for your response! I feel this way as well, as someone who has dealt with severe anxiety and bouts of depression with self harm since I was nine years old. 
I like my labels too because I haven’t been allowed to live a normal life and so this label is part of my identity now. It helps define who I am and the life I’ve lived. "
"They said, talk to the therapist at your school. .The issue you are having looks like - from what you have said at least - the transition to college. This is something they will have specialised skills and experience to help with. That would involve you making an appointment and having a go with them though. Is that something you could do?"
To be honest no.  I come from a family with such a long history of depression and anxiety that seeing my mom take meds (when it was still taboo) to get her out of a deep dark depression that absorbed us all during my childhood threw any stigma about meds out the window for me. They have saved me from a life of my minds own anxious torment.
"Buddhism is simply a practice is all. Offers alot. It helped me greatly to get to a better place. If you are willing to keep an open mind to the pratice. As it is important to realize this is not a religion friend. Personal quick story- I am a born again Christian by faith. Which I mean no offense by telling you this. Nor to convince you of any of that lol. Sorry, felt that was important to premise with. Buddhism change my perspective greatly!! I encourage you to take a look into that and meditation. Thank you for talking with me! I always appreciate the conversation. Peace and love to you!"
"Didn’t downvote but put yourself in OP’s shoes and imagine his friend as your brother/sister. I don’t think even an ounce of him supports the abusing, OP genuinely cares about his friend as a brother and doesn’t want to see him like this. Abuse is bad, but mental illness can play a role in that, OP wants to help his friend out so he can become a better person. 

I think that instead of shunning OP for staying by his side to help him, you should probably be rooting for him since he’s helping him. If he stays in this manic state and kills his ex or something, that’d be even worse."
"Here's the thing, I am writing TRUTH. You take it personally because you are depressed. Just like when I posted that comment trying to make the one poster understand life. I wasn't putting him down in any way. Just telling him things that are true. They weren't even directed at him. I was telling him how to be happy. That's what depression does. It denies you happiness. It tells you sad things make you happy. You have no clue how to be happy. That's because your depression doesn't allow it. It turns harmless comments into insults so you won't listen and find happiness. That's what it does. "
"Talk to them about this specifically. Most therapists use a client based approach, so tell them what direction you want to go (and also that you have mastered the skills you're talking about and don't want to focus on them anymore.) If trauma is a focusing point for you, ask to try exposure therapy or EMDR. I switched from a skills based approach to exposure therapy with my therapist and it was definitely the way to go for me. If you are still in contact with people who caused the trauma (or toxic people in general) learning to enforce boundaries could be another helpful skill set to learn."
"Those are really bad red flags he’s giving off. Manipulative behavior and showing up uninvited. You are not obligated to fix his problems. He needs to see someone immediately. Now, I’m not accusing him of anything, but that behavior reminds me of this obsessive boy in my area, he broke up with a girl and when he found out she was dating another guy, he came to her house and shot her. I don’t want you to freak out. I just think that situations like these can escalate very quickly if they aren’t helped.

If you can talk to his parents please tell them the situation so he can get help."
"Yup! I was just in a hospital last month and went through the same thing. It’s probably because we went from being in a super safe/secluded and quiet place for awhile to all of a sudden a fast pace area. When I was discharged, as soon as I stepped outside, it took me a few hours to get back into the swing of things. I remember going to Taco Bell with the Bf after he picked me up and I was being super careful with my surroundings and doing little movements as opposed to normally moving around. It also felt like my head was foggy and as if everything I did wasn’t processing into my head. "
"

Just because you don’t care about your own life doesn’t mean you should be able to speed and potentially put OTHER lives in danger. 

Again, reckless and careless driving is a symptom of mental disorders. You clearly have no regards for your own life because you are depressed. You have this outlook on life because that’s what depression does. So again, I’d suggest therapy. But this isn’t the first time you’ve posted on this sub. I get it helps to rant about it, but at some point you have to make that next step to truly help yourself, and no one can do that for you. It’s hard but it’s worth it. So please just consider it. 

You clearly aren’t happy. Yeah sure, none of us chose to be born or to be alive...but heck you might as well enjoy it while you’re here! And you can’t do that if you’re depressed and get no help. "
"Hope this link doesn't get removed, but I have found an article about it. I have PTSD and mindfulness makes all my symptoms worse. I also have a chronic pain condition, which is awful to manage if I'm ""focussing on the feeling of my body existing in space"" , because my body exists painfully. Very painfully. I needed therapy for my PTSD, not wishy washy crap about feeling my body becoming lighter and letting the thoughts happen to me. The reason I went into therapy in the first place was to *stop* letting the thoughts happen to me!!

It works for some people, but definitely doesn't for me. My issue with it is that it's being touted as a ""cure all"" when it isn't suitable for just anyone, and people are using it to make money off our mental health, and our pain.

"It took me over twenty-five years to even begin to understand what self love meant to someone like me (us) or anyone else who suffers from depression, anxiety or really any other type of mental illness. Creating a community even on Reddit, is really important. Just having Common Ground as you said is sometimes enough to Save a Life and if not save a life, at least it has great potential to improve the quality of life.

 It is not our job to help anyone else but ourselves first and foremost; and once we do that, we can help out others. you will get through this, you will survive, and no matter what... there is someone that feels that exact same pain that you do that you can't describe to those friends that don't stick around. Creating a safe and stable community is a great practice that we can do for each other. ✌️❤️������"
"People who experience clinical delusions such as your sister are unable to understand logic. I would suggest not to challenge her delusions directly. Don’t tell her she’s lying or crazy. Doing so might push her farther into her belief. 

Also- do not go along with her delusions. It will confirm what she believes and make things worse.

What you want to do is start asking for information in a unemotional, unbiased way.  Like you could ask if the school doing this to others or only her? Things that can challenge her in a way that won’t make her defensive. 

Getting her to verbalize how she came to this conclusion might get her to start thinking more logically.  A doctor will be the best at working with her so she can get better but in the meantime, this is how I would suggest interacting with her.  

Good luck!! I hope it’s temporary! "
"The bracelets are intended for first responders and emergency personnel. Should you have a psychotic episode, a first responder will not come near you until such time they feel it's safe to do so. You'll likely be tasered first.

If you have an iPhone, you can add any medical information into. First responders know to look there in the absence of medical bracelets. 

Reddit has a bad reputation (with merit) of being a cesspool. It's extremely rare to find any medical profession that has a presence on reddit or other forms of social media unless there's a webinar of sorts. Most professionals suggest those of us who have a mental illness avoid social media.

Any advice or comment is based on personal opinion and it's subjective. No matter who convincing or articulate the writer, don't rely it on, seek professional (qualified) certified advice."
"I deal with this often in my relationship too. I try and think about it like this: while your chosen partner should 100% take you seriously, there’s a good chance he doesn’t understand that your depression isn’t personal. You’re not choosing to feel the way that you do, and you would feel depressed just as often if your relationship didn’t exist at all. It’s so sooooo important for you to kindly tell your boyfriend how it affects you when he says insensitive things because (through his love for you) it’ll help him understand you better.
My boyfriend is 12 years older than me, and it took him a good 6months to understand what it means to date someone who is depressed. He thought it was legitimately a joke until I explained it to him.

Just be patient, and understand that he’s ignorant. Tell him with love. If he still doesn’t take it seriously or understand why his insensitivity is wrong, I’d say find someone who does. You’re valuable, you’re precious, and you deserve someone who can see that about you and wants to love you in a way that’s best for you. Best of luck xx"
"Pillar, your experiences have shaped and affected you. From what you have said, the flawed and downright evil people who have abused you have shaped your outlook on life.

Like it or not, those evil people have shaped your outlook somewhat, and that outlook has caused you to try and protect yourself from further harm, which is completely valid.

You can't deal with the flaws of other people, but you can deal with the effects those flawed people have had on your mental well being, and that is what a therapist is there to help you with.

This is why you might like CBT, it a essentially a program that gives you tools to deal with the negative effects other people in your life have had on your mental health and help you move forward. Its not easy, its counterintuitive, and you have to face your problems head on which is extremely painful at first, but gets better once you start to master them.

This is your journey, not ours, not your therapists', yours. The only way you can overcome your problems is to face them head on, and a good therapist will give you the tools to overcome your own problems."
"I really think it's a good idea you've sought out therapy and a psychiatrist.

It certainly sounds very self-destructive, but it's also interesting how you say you often don't remember these moments where you're angry and violent. That's something you really need to look into. I don't know if you've ever tried drugs or been drinking lots of alcohol, I know that can affect some people's memory.

But perhaps there can be a diagnosis for the issue you're describing and if you've really never been like this before, and it's started happening now as you're 45 years old, I'd say there's something that's changed in your brain and it's important you figure out what it is and if there's something you can do about it. Mindfulness/meditation, therapy or maybe some medication. 
I really hope you can figure these things out.

Have you experienced a lot of stress in the past? That can affect people in different ways if you've been supressing it for a long time and now it's coming out in angry outbursts and your mind is so stressed, you don't remember what happened and you're depressed to the point where you think about killing yourself and also trying to do it.
It could also be that you've been exposed to some trauma that you've been ignoring and it's built up for years and then bursts out of you like this, by you being angry, self-destructive and suicidal."

"I find that mindfulness only works for me when I practice it daily and when I have some sort of lens to practice it through. I often get very anxious going to unfamiliar places. To combat that, I’ll practice mindfulness by pulling out my phone camera and focusing on my surroundings, grounding myself, trying to find something pretty wherever I am to take a picture of. Suddenly I’m thinking of my surroundings artistically (breaking it into shapes and framing a shot) instead of focusing on everything that could go wrong. It usually helps. I also do this by drawing on napkins in restaurants."
"I have tried fixing my issues for over 13 years and I'm just sick of it all. Nothing works. Not therapy, not meds, not professionals, not the mental health clinic, not family, nothing at all. I'm just out of things to try. I honestly just want to feel happy for a few hours, that's all. Or even to just feel okay. That's all I want. I have addict in my family and I'm an addict (selfharm)too so I know to be careful and not make it a habit. Just once I want to feel ok. It's either that or I'm just too fucking tired to go on living. I'm that desperate for any positive feeling, no matter how small"
"You may desperately want to salvage this relationship with your current bf, but the relationship you have with yourself always takes priority. It's important to have a good foundation, a good relationship with yourself, before involving another person. I'm sorry about what you went through, it sounds like blatant abuse and torture. Therapy will help you make sense of the abuse ( as much as possible, it sounds literally inhumane), build your confidence back up, and help you start over. why did your sex life begin declining after 4 months? and what do you mean when you say the damage is done? "
"Definitely not a doctor but it sounds a lot like a bad panic attack, palpitations, ruminating decreasing thoughts, shaking, feeling like you’re going to die or something bad is going to happen (clinically recognised as a ‘sense of impending doom’!), even tingling feelings have been felt during panic attacks, derealisation and depersonalisation are common to both anxiety and panic attacks. Also the way you control the feeling by regulation your breathing to slow your heart and prevent hyperventilation is a really good way to calm down from a panic attack, it’s often the way therapists recommend and teach people to do. 

If you had a traumatic experience with your trip, that might be resulting in anxiety and resulting attacks of panic. Either way, I hope you see someone soon and they can help you out! Keep breathing like you’re doing!"
"I'd say it depends on the doctor. I mean no offense to all the amazing doctors, nurses, therapists etc out there, but some that aren't trying to help. In my case I had the same doctor for six years and the only thing he did was prescribing/represcribing  meds, if anything was wrong he just changed the current meds I had to another one. 

What I'm trying to say is that, if possible, change doctor or get a second opinion. Not against medication in any way, heck, it can do wonders for some! But if there are alternatives other than medication available, and you'd rather have that, press on it. Press on it till you get it. 

I don't know what country you're from so don't know if that'll do the trick, but I'm rooting for you and hope you'll get the help you're looking for and get better! 

Sorry for messed up writing/phrasing, hope I didn't offend."
"The problem with self-diagnosing, whether its for something mental or physical, is that it can skew what you report to the clinician. You may not volunteer things that don't fit the criteria of what it is you've self-diagnosed yourself with, and you may exaggerate those that do, especially if you are desperate for that label. I completely understand wanting that label - it makes you finally feel like there is hope for you. If you can be labeled, ie diagnosed, you can be treated, and you don't have to feel like a lost cause and so alone. I love what OP's therapist said: ""As long as you're actively trying to get better, and you do feel better, that is all that matters."" 

&amp;#x200B;

It's okay if your label is a like a rope helping you to navigate alongside a cliff, but don't make the mistake of using it as a crutch or a box to hide away in. "
"When you say you've been living off savings...are you no longer self-employed? What I'm asking is, do you have a current stable source of income? You should look into Medicare if not, because you should have insurance, you shouldn't have to pay out of pocket. You won't be able to pick your psychiatrists or counselors, but you deserve help.

I know exactly what you're feeling. Because I've been this way for years, and I'm 30, and ""it's too late for me"" is one of the shitty things my brain always tells me. Just recognize that your internal voice is kind of a dick, and there are always tons of options and lots of people out there that would love to help you, and while working hard for your mental health might be a fucking chore (I know it), it's a chore you owe yourself. Like cleaning your toilet or throwing out the expired stuff in your fridge."
"like i said, try to appeal to their self interest as much as you can. these are people who only feel empathy for themselves and not for others. 

my wife actually did cut her parents out of her life. she moved from a different country to be with me. unfortunately i don't see any other option long term. 

people on the dark triad spectrum might seek help for their pseudo-anxiety or depression, and get combative when it's discovered they're actually narcissistic or sociopathic, which makes further progress difficult if not impossible. 

 i've read studies about these disorders and so far i haven't really seen anyone put forward a tenable solution. my friends deal with narcissists too and i've linked them videos from experts. they all say ""just get out"". i'm sorry. :( 

maybe this sub will be a help: https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/"
"So to start off it really depends on the severity of the condition, and which bipolar you have (1 or 2) as there are 2 classifications that make a huge distinction in terms of functioning, meds, etc.. I first thought Bipolar was a death sentence but really its quite manageable for people with proper health care and a support system in place. 

Now once we move past that part I'll speak as I have the diagnosis of Bipolar II :

1. I struggle a lot with medications, (even before bipolar diagnosis I had depression and meds did not help) and usually have horrible side effects for everything. You know how they say on the box ""1% experiences some weird side effect"" well that was me. I went on seroquel initially, which really stabilized me after my first hospitalization but I gained weight on it so rapidly that I had high cholesterol levels and my doctors were fearful of my health and potential risks. I switched onto something else, and 2 months later I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt. Initially I was reluctant to go on lithium b/c I heard some scary stuff at support groups, but clinically it has shown the highest success rate to prevent suicide attempts. I have been on lithium for about 9 months now and feel it was the right thing to do. Meds are quite complicated. You take 1 thing thinking it will fix it all, and the side effects might not be worth it. It's very individual based. Usually Bipolar patients need 2- one anti psychotic and one mood stabilizer. Depends on your doc, just talk to them 
2. I only told relevant family and friends who were trustworthy, and helpful. Anyone who's judgmental or emotionally unstable I did not tell 
3. I'm a graduate student so I don't find my ""work"" effected. I was able to return to my program after my hospitalization and resume studies. I am not sure its not the case for everyone 
4. CBT was not for me. My mind works in a very structured, obsessive, rule based, hyper-organized fashion. CBT allowed me to indulge in endless lists, homework assignments, and writing exercises. It prevented me from living  life because I became obsessed with ""getting an A"" in therapy. I am by nature extremely analytical and CBT is as well, which did not help me change or grow as a person. I switched to someone very different and now I believe in therapy. Studies have shown that the type of therapy isn't so important, the relationship with the therapist and patient is crucial to getting better, however. I would try interviewing several therapists with different styles of therapy and see what you like

Anyway good luck! You will be okay, you're doing the right steps towards help :) "

I means a lot to know that my writing meant that to you... Thank you for reading. &lt;3
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any adult in your life that you can trust to talk to?
It’s ok.  I can’t sleep either.  It’s hard to fall asleep when bad things happen.
"Looking forward to reading you soon !

How are you feeling and where do you come from ?"
"Thanks for the reply mate.

Do you have any advice on what to do when I get an episode?"
Well if you don't want to get help then there's nothing anybody can do here. Good luck.
Yeah...I need to talk to someone too. :( I am not feeling any better since yesterday...
Yes i sleep with the lights on a lot as well. Is there any reason as to why that helps?
Yes sorry for being vague that's exactly what I mean then again it is also up to you :)
Yes. Sometimes I ask if past me was smart and did something that helps out present me.
Yo I finna just did the dab on those libdibz maybe you’d feel better if you did that.

"Don’t be afraid! I just started mine 3 weeks ago and feel so much better. You may have a few days adjusting with some side effects, but it’s nothing major.

I'm not too good with advice but I would like to say that you sound like an absolutely amazing friend and that B sounds like an extremely talented hard worker.

I'm so sorry this happened to you. You sound like you put your heart and soul into that relationship....it's crazy how a couple of rough months or adversarial situations can stretch a relationship thin enough to break. Good on you for opening up about it...its easy to just numb out and say screw it. Sending love &lt;3 You'll get through this
"It is I agree.  

I would really (even if you think you might not kill yourself)  encourage you to do some solo travel,  it might just change your life or at the very least some brain chemistry.  It's not as expensive as you think.  

I'm glad you're feeling a little less stressed.  I can zone out on YouTube for days,  it's stress reducing! "
"Not for someone who has already tried effective communication. And not for a partner that seems to be clearly abusive at the extreme or someone who doesn't care about her in the very least and is demeaning to women.

"Psych wards are inhumane places. I’m so sorry you went through that. I’ve worked in prison and in a psych ward - prison was definitely a more safe and humane place.

"Thanks for the tips. I know you aren't trying to give medical advice, just ideas. My Doctors haven't been helpful though.

All the best "
Yes I have and my parents have been ok with it. My mom supports me but my dad keeps saying it’s something I need to get over. Maybe it is but I’ve never felt this down and he’s really against medication so that’s not an option. I’ve given up on therapy because I really didn’t enjoy going there.   Thanks for the thoughtful comment
"You are the best expert of knowing what you need. Listen to what your intuition, to what your ""gut"" is telling you. It's gotten you this far.

Keep looking for those people, and don't give up. "
"also the fact I'm still ashamed of what I was doing before it happened and after it happened because at the moment I just saw it, and was trying to realize what i was seeing, then it skipped past and I forgot about it for awhile and I shrugged it off, then I thought about before bed and didn't fall asleep till 3am after having a panic attack"
"&gt; I did not write these questions they were taken from previous surveys

1. Then write your own questions.

2. You do realize that you've just admitted to plagiarism, right?

**EDIT** 

Based on your responses downthread, you'll probably want to take an introductory statistics course as well.  If you're conducting a survey with intent to publish, you need to be able to interpret the data, and you've admitted that you have no idea how your computer generates the results (although you *are* somehow sure the data isn't skewed).  Even the most basic stat course will solve that mystery for you."
"&gt; I mean, please don't take this as me being insensitive, because I'm not. I myself have both chronic depression and anxiety, but I'm on meds for both. 

I am not suicidal but I have a nephew who is a detective in an area with a high rate of suicides.  For the most part, he doesn't talk ""shop"" but every now and then, he lets loose with a ""Poor guy, he was just out-of-moves"".  I know you eventually become inured to the carnage; occupational hazard but I find it somewhat insensitive.

That said, if you are already predisposed to suicidal ideation, please stay away from negative influences.  "
"I am only on one psych med right now: Clonidine for Anxiety. It helps and I am thinking about asking them to up it more because it helps with the other issue I have (I am obsessed with fire), and helps me stop or ease the compulsions I have (to start fires). It doesn't totally stop them, but it helps. I was on meds for depression but I HATED them. They made me feel exactly what you described: fake happy. You can ask a Psychologist/Psychiatrist if there are any alternatives to taking meds if you don't like taking them...I am right there with you. I HATE taking medication too. Good luck to you!"
"I've isolated myself since 2016. I can tell you right now that if you keep isolating yourself, it's only going to get worse. Your symptoms are going to keep getting worse and worse as long as you hide from the world.

You're not alone when it comes to noise canceling headphones. I too where them. I'm unable to handle too much stimulation so the headphones help me. 

It might feel good to get away from the drama. But things will never change if you start isolating yourself again. You need to force yourself to get out of the house and go to therapy. It's the only way things may ever get better."
"So sorry you're going through this... Maybe check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She has a ton on [Narcissistic Personality Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjaeBMseW3o) (not saying that's what your husband has, but just what came to mind) and vids on being married to someone with mental health issues, how to make sure you're seeing a good therapist, etc. It's a great idea to see someone for support yourself. They won't be able to diagnose him without seeing him, but could definitely help you cope and maybe give you a direction to go in or an idea of what you're dealing with. "
"Thanks hah. Being on my own didn't help. Having dabbled in criminal psychology (through podcasts and blogs though so I am DEFINITELY not qualified to 100% that)  we have found some similarities with CPTSD but again we aren't experts, this is something an individual with pretty warped reality supposes and the next therapy appointment is monday. I switch between we and I because sometimes I mean my. So and I and sometimes it is just me. I am honestly afraid of saying we if I do. It is super diff for him atm and I think he might dump me if I do not get better. I would understand if he does tho. "
"The biggest thing you could do for him is to just support him on his journey to recovery. The fact he has already taken the step of going to a therapist is a wonderful sign, it shows he truly desires to help himself. What you can do now are just supportive acts. See if he wants to talk about how therapy is going. If you can find any helpful/positive programs, articles, or books, share any you think he might be interested in. Maybe suggest a self help or mental health forum. Just continue to be the positive and loving light in his life, as I’m sure you are now. Stay strong and best wishes :)"
"What do you think will happen if someone with paranoia doesn’t get help? I’m pretty sure I have paranoia, I have an irrational fear that someone has been after me/ trying to kidnap me or is using me for an experiment and I know that it’s just in my head but sometimes it’s hard to shake the feeling that it’s true. I’m terrified of doctors I always worry that they are ‘out to get me’ and are just going to use what I say against me to make people thing I’m crazy and get me committed or something so I avoid trying to get help. Will someone be okay managing paranoia on their own?"
"I'll just repeat what others have said. Make sure she sees a Doctor. Tell the Doctor the whole story - including the cannabis use.

There is very little use in arguing with someone who may be experiencing psychosis/ paranoid thoughts. With regards to the delusional beliefs, Do not challenge them directly or agree with them completely. It can be a tricky situation but you find it helpful if you speak to her about the evidence there is for the beliefs she has. Allow her to explore the beliefs on her own. 

As for what to do now. Make sure your she knows you are there for her if she doesn't feel safe. Please keep a close eye if she is voicing suicidal ideation.  

As mentioned by someone previously, if it is drug psychosis there is a good chance that it will just pass. However your sister may want to avoid mind altering substances in the future. "
"Well firstly, I had a strange episode back in December where I saw shadows at the corner of my eye, believed demons were in my house, and had a bunch of minor hallucinations. My psychiatrist thinks this was just anxiety but this was very different from my usual anxiety. 


Now with that aside, I have these more occasional symptoms that are similar to severe anxiety that makes it difficult to differentiate between the two.

1) mental film-reel. I’d get like a mental video in my head of the most disturbing or random shit imaginable. It was also have sounds to it so I’m basically seeing and hearing things in my head. Worse yet, if I focus on this mental image I am almost able to actually “see” it. 


2)  minor delusions. I would get a thought in my head that, even if completely impossible, is still difficult for me not to believe. Last night I tried to trigger an old “delusion” that someone’s watching me through a picture frame to accurately record these symptoms to my psychiatrist. After that, I felt very strange. I was asking myself if I believed that someone was watching me and I couldn’t tell if I believed it. I also get extremely uncomfortable and no longer wanted to think about it. Luckily I managed to calm down after and no longer feel uncomfortable but I still don’t know if I believe no one’s there or not.

3) random, out of control thoughts. This is somewhat similar to the mental film-reel. My thoughts get out of control at times. Not like a voice in my head, just extra thoughts. Like my brain would get “riled up” and let’s say I’m reading something and see the word “bread” I’ll hear the word bread ten different times in my head and then think of something loosely related to that word. 

4) I deal with severe lack of motivation. Well not severe to the point where I can’t take care of myself but severe enough that it’s ruined my grades and weight loss journey. I can’t tell if it’s just depression or what. I don’t always experience it dependent on mood. Sometimes I’ll not feel motivated to do something but feel totally fine doing whatever else.

"Again no they don't have dependency you can still be happy without it and you can stop taking it when ever you want they will slowly degrade the effect within a week or 2  and youll feel like you where before. If you read again what i previously sent i never said it wouldn't happen it can occur and its on the first week if you dont see any problems you can continue on the medication. 

SSRI like paxil or Zoloft barely have issues, SNRI like effexor has a little more side effects, unless you take MAOI (which i doubt) you wont have issues. 

For anti-psychotics atypicals or 2gen like risperdal have more sexual involved problems from a prolonged erection that causes pain to being unable to achieve one. With 1gen like haldol the has same issues but increased ""numbness"". All anti-psychotics will either give you hypersomnia or insomnia + nervousness."
"I am by no means an expert, but it doesn't look like anyone more qualified is answering.

I had an emotionally abusive relationship that left me traumatized and all kinds of messed up.  I am not the person I was two years ago when I met my ex-girlfriend.  I don't think the same way and I do not act the same way.  My personality is repulsive (think less disgusting and more antisocial) now and I really don't like who I am.

So, I pretend that I am who I was before the bad things happened.  I react to situations how I would have reacted back then rather than with the coping mechanisms I developed.  I pretend that the little boy I used to be hadn't lost his purity and innocence.  I pretend that I can trust people. I pretend that I have it all together, not only when I am with others, but also when I am alone.

And so far, it is working like a charm"
"As someone else said, medical alert bracelets are for first responders, so that they don’t accidentally do something counterproductive when trying to save the person’s life while the person is unconscious/unable to communicate their condition. They are not to alert the public, and one saying “PTSD” probably still wouldn’t help an EMT as everyone with PTSD responds to different things. 

If someone you know sees you having flashbacks/dissociating, and knows how to help, that’s great, and it’s helpful to educate your support people. If a stranger on the street sees it, they should call 911 and/or the emergency contact on your phone, because they don’t know when you might become dangerous to yourself or them (even if you won’t).

Maybe consider adding to the “medical alert” section of your phone, or carrying an index card in your wallet stating what’s going on and who the person should call. I would recommend that it not include things like using essential oils, as that’s not really the job of a stranger but rather to get you to either a person who knows you or to the ER. "
"Well the last time I went there, all be it for less than a minute, and it didn't go full spectrum either, was about 5 months ago. It was late at night, I was tired and also hung over and the memory of it popped into my mind out of the blue and suddenly it was happening again. I got incredibly freaked out but actually managed to force myself out of it. Before that was about 5 years ago, again while trying to sleep and still fairly drunk from a night out. I felt it come over me, but managed to keep myself relatively calm and ride it out as I tried to fall asleep. The time before that was about 11 years ago on a train, which was another episode that lasted no more than a minute or two.

None of these were as intense as the kind of attacks I got in adolescence though. And at its peak I was having maybe 1 or 2 a week. So it still reappears sometimes, almost as if to remind me that it's something that can happen. Though it's incredibly rare these days.

I do very often get momentary blips though, as though it happens for one instant and then it's gone before I've even fully realised. Certain feelings and textures and scenes also trigger it a little bit and I have to quickly change my focus. That kind of stuff is sort of normal for me now though. Its sort of ingrained into how my perception works I suppose. Maybe one day that'll stop too but who knows. "
"Hey friend!
At this point in your life, up until you’re about 22 or so, your body is going to be experiencing some dramatic shifts. I went through a lot of bodily hate too. That’s normal, but if you lead an unhealthy lifestyle (like not exercising, not **HYDRATING** {you should be drinking half your body weight in ounces of water a day at LEAST—hydration and mental health often go hand in hand}), it can feel really awful to just get out of bed most days. It is NEVER too late to start exercising every day. The minute I began incorporating daily exercise into my life (at least a half hour of cardio every day), my mental health improved dramatically.
Real quick, before I go on, girls don’t get sick less often than guys. That’s not actually true. The two genders are different, and each carries it’s own “benefit” and “limitation.” True, guys mature much slower than girls, but it all evens out eventually. As you get older, you’ll see the differences in who you are now compared to who you were even a year ago. I’m 23 and just watched a video of myself at 14 and CRINGED. I cringe at the things I did when I was 20, but again, I was almost a totally different person based simply on mental and physical maturity.
Now that being said, the thing that was killing my mental health the most was the fact that I lacked a relationship with God. Look, I know it sounds nuts and preachy, but I started reading Scripture and I found a passage that talked about fear and anxiety. No matter who you are, God wants you to feel at peace in life regardless of situational struggles. 1 Timothy 1:7 says “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.” If you place your faith in God (if you are granted the gift of being able to do so), it is written that you will HAVE sound mind. 
Sounds crazy, but I promise you 100% that my life took a 180 once I yielded to God’s plan for my life. Yeah I kicked and screamed a bit giving up my need for control, but once I did, ALL of my severe anxieties dissipated. I used to be up at night worrying about becoming schizophrenic because my imagination is incredibly hyperactive (a lot like yours—I can tell you’re artistic seeing your fnaf posts). What God gave you for beauty, creativity and imagination, the Devil tries to turn into something to fear. I know what you’re feeling like. I promise.
If you wanna talk or just need some support, message me. I’ll always answer. I promise I won’t preach at you. It’s my job as a Christian to impart peace to you and others in whatever way I can.

Praying for you my dude&lt;3


EDIT: a word"
20 I just commute from home to school save some money :) make fun of me all you want lmao
:) It's all cool. I understand what you mean. No worries. Just hmu if you need to chat.:)
Also do these hallucinations only appear while in bed when you are trying to fall asleep?
Damn that's pretty shitty then. But if it's free care then I guess it isn't too terrible.
Do you and /u/imogenewilcox owe this guy money or something?  Blink twice if you're okay.
"Echoing the no alcohol warning. And avoid weed too, it could start a psychotic episode.

"
Have you tried getting more professional help for this? I think that is your best option.
"Have you tried things other than medication? Like meditation, talking to friends and etc."
"Haven't used it, but I wanted to wish you luck and love and I hope it does help you out!!"
How is this even allowed? Does this person still have a job?  Like what the actual fuck.
I am about to go on Abilify and Cipralex and stories like this make me fuckin nervous....
"I will. you too, don't burn down the house. maybe you should get a fire pit or something."
I'm sorry you are dealing with this.  I hope you feel better and feel some peace tonight.
It has to do with ocd i think because i had it a couple of times but its a bit better now
Lexapro was the first med I tried and it *fucked me up*. Funny how everyone is different.
"No matter how many times you move the goalposts, this is still a bad and inoperable idea."
"No, it's linked to Cortisol and that increases fat storage. You're just a skinnyfat dude."
"Right, heavy regular users of cannabis are highly susceptible to getting this condition. "
Ru serious? U were fired because you opened up about your mental health to them? Really?
Someone living in MN who has found such courage is this video is cheering her on so hard!
"Sounds like some sort of OCD. You should seek a therapist to explore coping mechanisms.

"
Thank you. That does help me quite a bit. And congrats on actually getting some done haha
"Thanks, I’m going to really think about your advice. I hope you’re doing better now. "
"Thanks, sending lots of love and positive thoughts your way. I hope you don’t give up! "
The tired is probably caused by having to think through so many things just to function.
"While I loved his podcast with JR, I felt his book was lacking in any immediate solutions"
Why haven't you reported the unpaid overtime? I'd report that the first time it happened.
"Yes!! I do that too, especially when writing in my journal. I'm talking to myself! Wtf?? "
"but this is for workplaces where employees can reach out to other employees

&amp;#x200B;"
"Can you try deep breathing before you go to sleep? You can always talk to a doctor to see what he/she recommends. I am not one for sleep-aids, but short-term they are ok. You may want to contact a mental health professional to see if they can give you something for the anxiety. If you treat that, then maybe the sleep will be better. Good luck!"
DONT FRICKING SASS ME WHILE I DRINK MY 3RD SUGAR FREE MONSTER ENERGY TONIGHT OK SWEATIE I WILL GET THE FULL MIGHT OF THE ISRAELI ARMY TO TELL YOU TO PLEASE STOP USING MEAN EMOJIS MFER������������������������������������������������������
I always question if I could be doing more work. Code and do physics for 8 or 9 hours and then workout and smoke and play a videogame and sleep. Co workers work for 12 to 16 hours days and weeks on end. I would want to die if I had to do that but maybe thats why I am not successful. Ultimately we are all to blame but who cares I'm too tired...
"I felt the same when I found out I was too. But as others said you and your diagnosis aren’t the same. There’s possibility that the disorder can get easier to deal with and you can change those behaviors. Almost like it goes away. I started with dbt workbook and therapy. I’m on meds for depression as well. It gets easier, I promise you. "
I understand where you are coming from and why you would think of that as an answer. But ask yourself first. Do you really want those closest to you to be in the same pain  you are feeling right now? Could you really do that to your family and loved ones? Trust me when I say things will get better. This too shall pass if you give it the chance
"I would recommend you do. They tested you for the most common deficiencies. I've worked with a guy that had a similar problem it took forever to figure it out. In the end he had a deficit of something mostly think 99,9% only found in women. 

If necessary get a full analysis and maybe request a referral to a psychologist. It can't hurt right? "
"I've dealt with this too in the past. Everybody is different but it wasn't until this year that I've felt my emotions start to come back. So for me, it took a few years. But that's also because I refused to go see a doctor and get evaluated for the longest time. Nobody can tell you for sure. But I didn't start seeing a change until I got help."
"It means your therapist isn't right for you, more likely than therapy isn't right. Sometimes a therapist just doesn't click, and don't go into the right topics or really give you what you want out of the therapy. I feel like it's a lot better to have a therapist who is the same gender as you, but others may disagree with that, it's my opinion."
"Just read elsewhere that your issue is interpretation rather than focus. I think the sans solution might apply, but you can read the instructions back to them to make sure you got it right. Could be that this improves your interpretation skills as well.

Do you have the same problem with written instructions as you do with spoken instructions?"
"Lol, he sent me a message just before asking if I could comment on here defending him and when I refused and called him out on his behaviour and defended you instead he started calling me names, told me to kill myself and said he raped my mum and held a knife to her throat. He's trying to act tough but it's honestly just pathetic and comical. "
"My BetterHelp experience was so poor. $250 on assistance and the therapist just gave me a sheet to fill out like I was a kindergartner. When I brought up my adhd and what comes with it, she danced around the issue. Her specialty was “relationships” and I was struggling with depression and anxiety. Their marching system really is terrible. "
"Telling her to set appearance goals in the mirror is absolutely the wrong thing to do. That's just encouraging her to put more value into her looks, and giving her the idea that you have a specific goal of what you want her to look like. Make sure you are putting value into her as a person, just stop talking about her appearance all together. "
"Thank you so much, it means a lot to hear and I'm honestly trying my best to become someone who's feelings and thoughts aren't dictated by others. I just feel like it's ingrained so deep into me sometimes it becomes hard to separate myself from that. I really appreciate your message and I look forward to watching your YouTube in the morning :)"
"Thanks! 

Yeah, I had been in the hospital the previous day because my doctor thought I might have had appendicitis (I did not.) 

I went home and the next day I thought something was really wrong and went back only to find out t was my anxiety acting up horribly. That was the moment I knew I needed to talk to someone about trying medication. "
"The guy admits that what he’s done is wrong. He’s reaching out to Reddit because he’s trying to stop it before it gets out of hand. He’s concerned about himself because HE’S the one putting the child in danger, and he has to find help HIMSELF before he can ensure the safety of his child. So yeah, I do consider that pretty self-aware."
"Yeah. I was on my way to a suicide attempt last semester and no one cared about what I did, how many warning signs I gave them, or what I just flat out said.

I dragged my bare arm across the entire brick wall of my campus until it bled and left stains and no one gave a goddamn shit. No one filed a behavioral report on me or asked or anything."
"\*stands and applauds\* Bravo. This is so well-written. My anxiety is pretty bad right now, and I am still in the process of being afraid, stressed out...I haven't accepted it as a part of me fully and it doesn't serve to push me to do anything better--it still holds me back HOWEVER, that being said, this gives me hope. :)  


Thanks for this."
"Borderline is emotional angst. Self worth come from validation from others. You’re sense of self if found through others. At our core we are in a state of panic fearing abandonment. If we are abandoned then we are as worthless as we thought. So we panic and inappropriately attach to people...which ultimately leads them to abandon us. 

BP episodes are triggered by stress usually it’s a change in routine..lack of sleep/med change/death/job/marriage etc. The fluctuation in mood is less rapid.. Hypomanic to Manic to Depression the cycle last anywhere from weeks to months. Not hourly as in BPD."
"Talk to your professors first, explain that you have depression issues and you were not aware before you started at school that it would be a real problem. See if they recommend dropping out for the rest of the semester and coming back when you have gotten some therapy and ways to cope with depressive episodes. 

Talk to your family after your talks with professors. Explain to them that you need some time to gather your psyche, to get better prepared to do the things that college needs you to be able to do. You still want to attend college, but it will take a little more time to finish is all. "
"When people are at the stage of requiring hospital treatment for their mental health, they often do not have the insight required to self admit. 

If you cannot cope with daily life due to these mental health issues or believe you are at breaking point, it would be best to attend whatever local health service is available to you. I am not sure where you are but I often advise people to see their Doctor at the earliest point possible once they identify any mental health issues. There may be a community based mental health crisis team that can support you without resorting to hospital admission. "
"I think the most important thing to remember is, you and your therapist/counsellor are a team. You both have to work together. If you want therapy/counselling to be beneficial you have to find someone that you feel comfortable with. I've been to counsellors and therapists all my life. It can be helpful but you have to be in the right frame of mind to share. You will share a lot with your therapist and they will push you (in an encouraging way). They push you to help you. It can be hard but if you do the work it will pay off. I have to work at it nearly every day but it makes me feel stronger. They are there to help you learn skills to cope. They are training you to be your own therapist. I hope that helps and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. I've had a lot of experience with this area. The best of luck and mind yourself x "
"Hey hey! I have GAD too and whenever I have to go on a flight or do anything that consists of traveling somewhere, I usually bring comfort things with me that help take my mind off of everything. I usually bring stuff such as slime, a favorite plushie, a stress toy, puzzles, coloring, drawing, etc... something that kinda forces yourself to think about what you’re doing. For me atleast, it helps keep me grounded because my mind is focusing on what’s in front of me rather than scenarios going on inside my head. 

If you don’t think that would help though and no for sure that you will not be able to handle the airplane ride, I would definitely suggest talking to your doctor and ask them if they can maybe prescribe you with something. But I would do it as a last possible solution and only if someone else is coming along with you so they can help watch over you. This YouTuber I watch also has GAD and he was prescribed Xanax for his air trip. He filmed his air trip and you can tell he was definitely on cloud 9 the whole time even after they landed lol. 


Hope this kinda helped. Happy travels :)!"
"I agree with others who have said that it’s worth bringing up to her.  But keep in mind people go into the field wanting to help and not to judge you.  Don’t be so hard on yourself comparing like that. Although it’s probably a very natural reaction to feel that way. I definitely feel the same type of comparison when (excuse me I made an edit) people very close to age progress farther than I have. But remember that your life path is unique and mental illness or setbacks doesn’t make you worse or a loser. You didn’t choose to have it. Maybe this is a moment to learn to have more compassion for yourself. 
 
It also comes down to compatibility and competency, not age. I think if you feel that she is helping you then it’s worth sticking around, but if not then you can always find a different therapist.  

But you as a patient have the right to choose with what makes you comfortable. We all have preferences.  Some people want certain gender therapists, some people want the same cultural background, some people want experienced older ones, etc. It all comes down to what you think will help. "
"Yes, I’d say it is possible. The brain is constantly adapting and if someone spends the day thinking and thinking and thinking, the brain adapts in a way that similar thoughts occur more often and seem more powerful. In other words:

""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster.
And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.""

Here’s another thing: if we encounter a situation, our brain uses the knowledge available to make sense of it and do its best to come up with an appropriate response. If we see a tree, things are pretty obvious. We know what a tree is. If we look at our confused and ill mind, it’s not that simple. What does the brain do, if knowledge explains 10% of the story only? It just makes something up! Telling oneself the same thing over and over, it becomes more believable. This is how people start having suicidal thoughts. The brain has no better idea, so it comes up with half truth. This is usually no problem, because we have trial and error. It’s a functioning system. But with suicide, it obviously is a problem."
"***Edit: Also, /u/Ryaubee is not a counselor. Please do not take advice from her. She is a writer and her behaviour on this sub is incredibly misguided and inappropriate.***

Again, petal, if you're so confident, send me your name, title and workplace. I want to make a complaint about your behaviour. If you're doing nothing wrong (and, indeed, you *are* a counselor), you should have no problem with that request.

Professional recommendations are *not* fine when you are labeling an individual you do not know with a term as stigmatizing as ""an abuser"". Something which you have explicitly and implicitly done multiple times. Professional recommendations are not fine when you do not have any information about the person, their relationship or their partner. They are not fine when your recommendation is literally *anything* outside of ""go and seek help from a professional"". The fact that you even think it's appropriate to make any suggestions beyond that tells me that you are not a counselor or, if you are, that you are incredibly negligent.

You have no idea what impact your words and recommendations could have in this situation and you could likely cause as much harm as you intend to solve. What if OP pushes the situation, calls her partner abusive, is correct, and he smacks her in the face for it? You literally have no fucking idea what you're tampering with and you need to stop.

I'm aware of those other ""professionals"" and I correct them every time I see them. This is not a place to conduct therapy, it is a place for people to seek peer support and advice. As professionals, the only advice we can give is to see a professional. Don't waste your amateur, untrained, excuse for armchair psychology on an actual psychologist. Or, if you want to, at least have the balls to give me your incredible insight as to what I'm attempting to ""justify within myself""."
"If I may be honest, I don't know if there's a single person on the planet who can hold a family up on their own under the circumstances you have been given. I'm young so I can't even imagine the struggles that come with parenting, I will only know them when I have kids of my own. But I do have a lot of experience with mental illness, as well as being the child of a single father who struggles with PTSD and depression.

You've hit a low, a lot of different events are happening and it's overwhelming. Some of them you have a degree of control over, some you don't; all of it sucks. Talk to your family, talk to your wife and talk to your kids about what is happening. Don't allow yourself to isolate your pain and go through it alone. It is hard, and it is going to be hard, there is no way to sugar coat the pain that life puts people through sometimes.

I do feel that as men, there is a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with mental health, particularly for fathers. I constantly hear men be told to ""be strong"", for their kids and for their wives. Their problems are often swept under the rug of toxic masculinity. Even those of us who are conscious and make active efforts to not allow gender roles to interfere with ourselves can get swept up in it, particularly in tough situations where we only have the words of others, and all we hear is ""be a man"" when we need love and help.

I pray that your father makes it through to Christmas with enough health to smile. Cancer is a terrible happening, it's a problem that's very near and dear to my family. It is helplessly destructive, and all we can do as the family is watch and cross our fingers. There is always a little shred of hope though, sometimes their predictions can be wrong. My grandfather was given 6 months, kicked it for 2 more years. 

I send my best wishes to you and your family. Things are really hard right now, but you still have your wife's hand to hold and your children to love. Keep them close, this isn't just your struggle, it's theirs too. You are in this as a family, and as a family you will leave it; the road just got a little bumpy on the way."
"You should see a therapist. God gave people all different abilities and gifts to contribute to this world and help others. He made your (future) therapist, just like he made you and your husband. He created that person knowing you would need the help and that they could provide it. Think of it like a pastor/priest. If we could just understand God and the Bible, we wouldn’t need someone to guide us and teach us. Likewise, if we could easily understand ourselves and treat all our own illnesses, we wouldn’t need doctors (psychiatrists/therapists included). I think someone else here said you just need to go to church, but I strongly disagree. Church won’t treat cancer or diabetes, and so it also won’t cure most serious mental illnesses; God gave us professionals to help us with these things. It can definitely provide emotional and spiritual support, and/or physical support if you need help in your day-to-day, but please please please for your sake and your marriage’s, go see someone who is trained to help you mentally. You deserve the support of a good therapist who can help you heal. 

Edit to say I misread the guy above me’s comment, he said you should speak to someone too. Edited also to add I as well am a Christian!

Edit 2 to say this is all in your husband’s best interest as well, as it is a lot of stress for him to bear. It can be very emasculating to not be able to solve your wife’s problems and disheartening when your best efforts don’t make a difference. He is not trained or equipped to give you the necessary support, insight, and tools to overcome this, and he shouldn’t expect himself to know how to bear this burden. Husbands are (or can be) great emotional supporters and wonderfully strong partners (I have a great one!) but unless he is trained to do this, he should want you to seek the help you need. Again, he wouldn’t be your only support and counsel if you had cancer or diabetes; you would still see a doctor. Same goes for this. (I hope I am conveying that this is in support of your husband’s struggle, not criticizing him! And definitely not criticizing you either.)"
Google that exact phrase and you'll see you're not alone. There's real science behind it.
I hate it. Dont ask that q if youre not really lookin for an answer. Always throws me off.
I think it’s situational you definitely don’t just get onset severe depression/anxiety
I would love to. But i can't afford health insurance. Nor another uninsured medical bill.
"I'd you need to, then definitely bring it up and explain how you're feeling. Good luck. :)"
I'm having a very low day too. So I built a blanket/pillow fort. Gotta feel safe somehow.
Let’s all report this users posts to mods. This person is not respecting the subreddit.
Omg I thought I was the only one who did this except the song for me is Numb - Linkin Park
So important to see posts like this. Thanks so much for sharing this beautiful experience.
Some of us just got dealt a bad hand. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel either.
"Sounds like mania. Mania is most commonly a part of bi-polar, but it can occur on its own."
Thank you for your encouragement. I’m going to try to post it sometime today hopefully.
"Thank you, really.I can tell you have a beautiful soul and I'll keep this in mind 

��"
"Thanks a lot for replying, going to bite the bullet and try and find someone this weekend."
"Thanks. We have 4 cats that she’s walked out on too, so I got them to keep me in check. "
Thats definitely not the case. That line of thinking was a mistake I will only make once.
Yeah. I was quite drunk but sober enough where as I could at least see and think properly
"You could also listen to relaxing music, this would help put you at ease whilst driving :)"
You might’ve actually had mono and unfortunately your energy might never been the same.
You should see a doctor or psychiatrist for a diagnosis. This could be a number of things.
You were VERY eloquent and understandable friend. I can offer you tons of hugs. Take care!
"You're not alone , I am right there with ya . It's no wonder why I don't have any friends "

"i was just joking. sorry, didn't know you didn't tell him about it why don't you tell him?"
"Deep breathing...visualization of a calm place (aka ""happy place"")...soothing music. I had a panic attack for the first time in a long time just recently after I was told what my diagnosis is, and these all helped me come back down and settle myself. I wish you luck and I hope you feel better! My messages are always open if you need to talk. :)"
"I am glad you got him to a hospital, but while he's there it would be a good idea to maybe grab his guns. If he needs to feel safe maybe get a home security system instead and a self defense weapon that he can't use for suicidal, like mace or a bat. A large dog is also some of the best security you can get and might be good for his spirit too. "
"I know you are replying to OP but I just wanted to say I really appreciate your comment because this is exactly what I needed to read for myself. I experience this all of the time and it is so hard to overcome it at times, but you have really helped me realize that I don’t have to believe every thought that comes to mind. Peace and blessings!"
"I'm managing it a lot better now. Most of the time I'm resting. I usually only have enough energy to sustainably take care of my body, do light chores and errands. I also have PTSD which I feel like is so comorbid with the Autism. They sometimes have similar symptoms but for different reasons. So they can exacerbate each other in certain ways. "
"I'm sorry that I can't help you more because I'm younger and cannot relate much to your situation in life, but whenever I have suicidal feeling I just think about how it would affect those around me. And that even if I don't know it, I matter to people around me. I hope that I can help you at least in the slightest by just letting you know this"
"It is absolutely possible to be born with anxiety. Anxiety runs in families, and it's not just the result of learning. There are strong biochemical components. And if your mom had anxiety when pregnant with you, this could have been passed on to you in utero. Not to Mother blame, this is just one of the many ways that people can become anxious."
Schizoaffective is schizophrenia with mood disorder symptoms. There’s schizoaffective depressive type and bipolar type. So it’s basically having two disorders at once. Just being diagnosed with schizophrenia is a single illness. And yes that does sound like mania. Mania doesn’t have to be euphoric. It can appear as one big anxiety attack
"Yes. It’s called suicide ideation. I would speak to your family doctor about this immediately. If you’re not opposed to medication, there are certain SSRIs that will help treat both major depression and PMDD. If you don’t want to go that route, therapy is another option,  but please either way talk to a professional so they can help you. "
"Your Mom obviously doesn't understand anything relating to your situation whatsoever. You didn't choose to do any of that. You didn't wake up and say ""okay, I'm gonna have an anxiety attack at 2:13 pm today and no one can help me."" You didn't do anything wrong, you're perfectly fine just the way you are. Don't let her snide comments get to you
"
"idk man i think you answered your own question. maybe it reminds you of everything that you ""should of had,"" but lost. maybe you resent that they're living a life that you were so close to having. 

it also doesn't help that those people look like they're taking their money/houses for granted and rubbing their success in everyone else's faces. "
"“You May feel like shit and hate everything but as long as you look okay on the outside you’re capable of going to work”

It seemed like such awful advice at the time but i tell myself that some mornings and it forces me to leave my house. Only after that do i realize that things aren’t as bad as I’m making them out to be in my head. "
"I started dealing with mental health problems when I was 14. I never got help. I thought I knew better than everybody else and I found ways to self-sabotage my own life. When I was 21, almost 22, I first started having psychotic episodes. Again, I never got help. Many months later I lost my job and I'm still unemployed right now. I'm 26 now. Things could always get better on their own, but do you really want to take that chance? It could always get much, much worse. You need to go see a doctor if you haven't already. You don't want to be dealing with this stuff for the rest of your life like me."
"Thank you. I am battling Depression, Anxiety and Pyromania (of all things) and this made me see how people with mental illness look so ""normal"", but inside they are a total mess sometimes. If you look at me, you would never know I compulsively start small fires (never anything big mind you--I have enough control to know better) and that I'm always thinking of fire and what it looks like, smells like...that rush of heat that you get when you're standing over a burning piece of paper. You would never guess it. This video really brought home the fact that we are suffering, but we are people too. :)"
"What supports are you accessing?

&amp;#x200B;

Are you able to go to groups?  Do you have a therapist?  Do you have a psychiatrist?  Are you on Meds?  Are the meds working? Do you have social supports/are you isolated?  Are you in good physical health?  Are you sleeping?  How do you manage your stress?  What strategies do you have in place when you panic?

&amp;#x200B;

Like, yeah, some people with MI have trouble staying in jobs. Some cant work period. Some just cant work when they are ill but do fine when their illness is managed. I guess Im wondering how and if you are managing your illness?"
"1. Reminding myself that I'm not a failure because I'm not able to get into the routine or develop habits that align with my values. Everyday I fail to wake up early and do things that matter to me before work. Everyday I fail to start watching my diet like I used to. Everyday I fail to work on my side passions because work takes the majority of my day.
But mostly importantly,  Everyday is a new day to keep trying and get a bit closer. And that makes me feel better.

2. Also, I've started taking hot showers at night. I have a very busy schedule that doesn't allow to me take a relaxed bath. It's always super rushed in the mornings. In and out. Starting to take showers in the night allows it to be a self care thing. I have actual time to condition my hair for once! And there's nothing like feeling relaxed and squeaky clean before getting into bed. "
"Ah yes, I was thinking after that if he said it in a snotty tone then he probably is an asshole.

I had a boss like that, never a compliment without a ""you could of done better"".

A lot of it is a generational thing. I had to move back home after living away for 10 years. My father did not understand mental health during my childhood and until I drastically started getting healthy at 30ish he finally understood that not all illness is physical. 

But I really do think Dad learned, we have some other employees with physical and mental health issues and I no longer hear: he's just being lazy, or: he just doesn't want to work. 

I wish I had the balls when I was younger to stand up and call out one specific boss for attitude like your boss. But at the time you're really doing everything just to keep your shit together and getting fired doesn't help."
"i’ll share one of my experiences, maybe it can shed light.

i’ve been dealing with an abusive boyfriend for 4 years. he stripped me of every self confidence that I had because he wanted full control. he lowered me down to the ground. just when i was about to walk away and leave, he acted as if he was the weakest human being ever. 

don’t ever overestimate others, or look at their perfect lives because no one knows whats behind closed doors. 

you have it in you, and you will with time take full charge. what helped me and still helping is never talking about my weakest points or breakdowns. i’d mention it lightly, but would never dwell on it. it made me more confident in myself that (im the only one here who can help ME).

taking the first step by your self is so uplifting and life changing. and time will show

goodluck to you friend &lt;3"
"Being a parent is already an extremely labor intensive and emotionally exhausting task. The fact that you're providing for your son and making an effort to find a job is already SO commendable. 
I think the biggest motivation you can have right now is your child. Think about how happy he would be to have a stable childhood and not have to worry about the things you have to worry about.
As for your boyfriend, I think direct communication is super important. It seems that you are a really nice and submissive person, so you take every single household chore upon yourself. It shouldn't be like that! You deserve a break. Start deliberately asking your boyfriend to help you out with tasks (can you do the dishes? Can you fold the laundry?). Maybe he thinks that you have it all taken care of and needs the gentle reminder. Let him know that you don't like his lazy behavior. Be stern but kind.
Juggling these responsbilities is a sign of your strength. I believe in you and good luck with your job search. At such a young age, finishing school and having a family is something you should DEFINITELY be proud of!"
"If you have a particular issue, look for someone very experienced and specialised in that issue. Avoid 'generalists' (unless you have a broad set of concerns).

&amp;#x200B;

Be very up front with the person at the initial meeting and tell them exactly what youi want. Also tell them what hasnt worked for you and see how they respond. If they have any strong opinions about how you need to work, thats a red flag

&amp;#x200B;

Be very wary of therapists who have 'ideas' about whats best for you. In my experience, really good therapists are  skilled at helping you finding out your own truths and hidden skills/knowledge. Therapists who are coming from a 'I know how it should be and will teach you how to do things' are not so useful in my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell them, as you go, what is helpful. Also, tell them, as you go, anything they are doing that is not helpful. You are essentially training them how to be your best possible helper. Dont be passive. A good therapist should want to know this!  If they disregard, or are resistant, that could be a red flag.

&amp;#x200B;

Be aware that Group can be just as helpful, if not more helpful, for some people, than 1:1 therapy. If you havent been a member of a therapeutic group, its definitely worth trying. 'therapy' is one of many ways to get well. It is not the only way...

"That sounds like you've been through a lot.  Events don't affect all of us in the same way, which is why I phrased it as ""traumatic event"" versus ""trauma"".  You and I might live through the same experience and you might emerge unaffected while I am traumatized by it.  Does that make sense? 

In any case, foster care alone would immediately make me begin to think about trauma.  The physical abuse would, too. It *is* possible that you came through *all* of that with *no* emotional or mental impact.  However, it is *likely* that the story that led to your foster care (and everything surrounding that), as well as the physical abuse were traumatic events for you.  *If* that's the case, compounded by the ADHD diagnosis (and, of course, possible further traumatic experiences later in life and/or in the military), ""anger issues"" would be an understandable symptom.

Please understand: I'm not saying any of these events *were* traumatic for you. Only you can say that and you certainly don't need to respond here. I'm just hoping to give you some possible direction to look for answers.  Also, be kind to yourself. I don't know any more about you than what you've typed.  But, communicating (with your wife) and looking for help are big steps.  If the VA can't or won't help you with therapy, there are therapists out there that see clients on a sliding fee scale.  "
"The most important thing for me was to regain a sense of hope. The real turning point in someone's depression, I believe, is when they look at all the suffering that they feel and that everyone else is feeling, and realize that the hopelessness is a symptom of depression. It has a very cunning way of making it seem like your dread and sadness is the true reality that no one else can see; like a veil has been lifted for you and only you, and anyone who is happy just doesn't know the *real* real. When you see depression like that, it might help you realize that happiness and true peace of mind is an actually achievable thing.

Then it was just a matter of fighting, clawing my way out of the pit day in and day out for a long time, forcing myself to respect the strength it takes to do it, and no matter how ""pathetic"" I might have thought I looked, I had to keep telling myself that it is a testament of strength. Anyone in your or my shoes at the time of struggling would absolutely agree, but they can't really *see* depression easily. We're still in a society that has a bit of trouble responding well to this kind of illness.

And it may sound like fucking *hell*, but I guarantee you it is better than staying at the bottom of the pit forever. And if you are vigilant, you will see the progress: certain horrible thoughts no longer run through your brain every day, some activities you were completely incapable of doing are now tolerable, getting out of bed and staying awake is a bit easier... the miraculous thing for me was that after a long while, I was able to get through my day without having negative thoughts attached to every single thing I did. That was incredible to me.

This was my experience, though. I was able to get a good counselor to help me, a decent psychiatrist too, and a decent support group. Those three things helped me immensely. I fought it for only a few years, not decades, so I only know so much about what you're going through, and I'm truly sorry, I wish I could help you further. All I can say is the concept of hope above, and seeking a truly good mental health expert/therapist.

[This guy wrote about his depression a long time ago and I have always come back to his tweet for inspiration.](https://twitter.com/executivegoth/status/912374193890529280?lang=en) Nowadays I wholeheartedly agree with what he says now that I've gotten out of the pit (""getting fully out of depression is like going technicolor in the wizard of oz."") I hope you find some answers somewhere in here, maybe some comfort. Take care

Also I hope I don't hang the word ""happy"" over your head or make it sound insultingly easy. I am self-conscious about that when I write in these posts, because there was I time where the term ""happiness"" really genuinely felt like a facade to me. So I write with respect to where you are at right now, please pardon me if I made it sound insulting"

I finally began to recover with CBD and a little of the right kind of marijuana. I needed an extra tool in addition to all of my other tools. It worked wonders.

"It takes lots of time to sort out mental health. Medications can only do so much and you have to work WITH the prescribing doctor to monitor effectiveness and side-effects.

Sorry you are going through this.  Try small steps.   Try to wake a bit earlier each day.  Jog in morning.  Try a yoga class.  Avoid dairy and gluten.   Be disciplined.

"A 504 plan helps students with disabilities to get accommodations so they can better succeed in school. A school counselor would be able to help put a plan together. So like for depression, you might need early access to powerpoints, a note taker in class, a private room or extended time for testing, or more time to do homework, etc. It can take some of the pressures off and make school fair for you.

Being a little cynical is ok. I think it is actually healthy if you question things that don't seem right. Try to see beauty in the world too because there is a lot of it all around us. I hate to be cliche but stop and smell the roses sometime. :) I have to remind myself that every day when my pyromania gets bad and I can't see anything but hopelessness in my future. Anxiety kicks my disorder off and depression follows soon after I satisfy my craving...it's a vicious cycle BUT then I remember that the leaves will be changing here in the northeast US pretty soon and it lifts my mood. :) Good luck!
"I think chances are people care, they just don't know how to express it or don't realize how much you need to know they care. My dad is dying and he has never been good about keeping in touch with family members, but cousins we haven't seen for decades have been calling and sending really sweet cards and presents and clearly care about him so much. It's good to see how much love is out there for him. And I'm sure there's a lot of love for you, too.

Please stay alive. People care. And if you stay alive you'll meet even more good people who will care about you and bring good things into your life."
"I’m not very good at conversation myself, but I think that is a skill that comes with practice. Though, some people can learn that skill faster than others either from biological or sociological factors. For me, conversations are usually steered by the other person in which you just respond to their questions/statements and say something to them when you have a clear thought either a question or statement to them. Also conversations are always awkward when you think they are because you make it that way. But hey, take this with a grain of salt as you’re doing better in the romance department."
"My response was written in the same context as your therapists, who were also questioning YOUR flaws and not asking for some sort of State of the Union address where you point out ""everything wrong in the world and with other people"" and completely ignore your own shortcomings.

"The fact that you are able to introspect is indicative of normal personality development. Awareness of oneself and introspection into oneself usually means you cannot hit criteria for diagnosis of a personality disorder NPD is a serious diagnosis and these people's lives are completely falling apart (whether they see it or not).

It is possible to have traits of a personality disorder without having the full blown diagnosis. If you are concerned that your behavior is preventing you from having the relationships that you want, or living the life you want, seeing a therapist would be very helpful. "
"You/Jane should stop texting him and get the fuck away from him.  You are not responsible for his depression or his shitty behavior.  Neither of you.  Block him on social media, document any suicide threats (which he won't carry out, it's just another abuse tactic to keep you arround so he can hurt you more), and call the cops on him *every single time* he does it, until he either stops and leaves you alone (ideal), or makes good on his threats and rids the world of one more abusive shitbird (which he won't, because he wants to keep hurting you, and he can't do that if he's dead).

Good luck, OP."
"is this a troll post? if not then posting that on reddit is really not smart, and if you are serious at least you’re procrastinating by spending time posting on here lol. seriously though murder is not an answer to anything, not only will you regret it someday after rotting in jail you’ll have killed your family, for what i’m assuming is a really petty reason. i’ve been at the point where i’ve seriously wanted to hurt my sister at times because she’s a horrible person but i’m very glad i didn’t, because she’s family and you can mend things with family. family are irreplaceable. "
"PTSD is so layered and imbedded deep in our psyche that we can have a very hard time recognizing it in ourselves. But if you think of one negative aspect of yourself that always makes you wonder, “Why am I like this?” It can usually be traced back to the trauma. A therapist is going to have a much easier time recognizing this from the perspective of an outsider. 

It is worth digging deeper whenever you are ready to face it. Every time I have faced an element of my trauma and worked through it, I feel a huge burst of positive energy and it’s like a rebirth almost. Recognizing where the behavior comes from is the only way to change. 

Last thing to mention, do some research about how PTSD affects our brains and the difference of those who have not been diagnosed with PTSD. The scientific evidence behind it is shocking and really fascinating! "
"Therapy. But sociopathic tendencies generally don’t tend to go away, at least not without a massive effort to change. Best advice is to quit thinking of yourself so highly, you’re nothing special (me, and every other living person included), understand that literally nobody outside of your family gives a single fuck about you, and find fulfillment in enjoying life and making others happy. You’re still basically a child so you are still nowhere near mature, which bodes well for changing. But to change you need to understand that the fundamental way you think is the problem. Best of luck to you. Also, you should apologize to the boys you’ve been toying with, I’m sure you’ve hurt them, and they blame themselves for that undeservedly.

Edit: I don’t mean to sound crass or insult you, just speaking from a completely unbiased perspective. "
"I feel like my parents and I are in a weird codependent environment... 

They had me young so although I got my physical needs (food, shelter, clothing, etc) met, I never really felt like my emotional needs were met, almost like they didn’t know how to be parents because they were still kids themselves, or that they cant handle my emotions.... so for that reason I feel like I am subconsciously seeking/waiting for them to be the parents I want  (need?) them to be... even though it won’t happen...

On the flip side, I notice they tend to treat my actions as personal attacks against them... and if I really dig psychologically into it, I think that they view my personal struggles, set backs and other issues as reflective of their parenting- which it isn’t necessarily. i.e. I forgot to pull my car forward to give my dad space to park behind me (I had just come back from a week long vacation- and genuinely forgot he has to park behind me now because we have too many cars)- but according to him I did that (purposefully) because I’m inconsiderate and don’t care about him (I actually just forgot!)"
"I want to point out two positives about this post that are not irrational. The first is realizing that you dont enjoy manipulating people, admitting that to yourself and others. That's a sign of a good self-aware consciousness actively wanting to be a good person. 

The second positive thing is being able to say ""that's just my opinion"" whereas most people state their beliefs as pure fact (without ill intentions of course, that's just how it is). This is a sign of keeping a humble mind, and remembering that anything you say is just a one among 7 billion perspectives. It's healthy to know, and to let others know that the advice you give isn't something you're telling them with arrogance to do. Other lines you might try could be ""I think, I believe, in my perspective, the way I see it, but hey what do I know,"" etc.

One irrational part that seems to be negatively effecting your mind and life (the definition of mental illness) is overthinking these traits as negative things. If you do feel like you're having problems manipulating people (and maybe realizing it in the middle/after the fact), that's also something you could seek to keep trying to change about yourself. If talking to a therapist or friends about it isn't enough to flip your perspective, I highly recommend the almighty perspective flipping weed (not a big pharma fan), along with some writing maybe to keep track of the manipulation patterns you see. Other perspectives (such as my own) would see some of these traits as honorable and nothing to feel guilty about.

Try to focus on the way those other perspectives might see your traits as honorable and nothing to feel so guilty about that you bury yourself into a solitary hole. Try to focus on what you want to be instead of dwelling in the idea that what you are is unchangeable. Keep your mind focused on how you're going to get out of this hole, keep it focused on not feeling guilty about what you're trying to change, and keep it focused on how much you want to be sociable and enjoy your friends/family while you're still alive with us right now.

Hope that helps even a little, best of luck friend!"

Never be afraid to reach out and speak with a therapist or anonymous call line if you feel like you should, theres no shame in talking with people who want to help.  For the racing type thoughts, maybe look into diet (what you eat and when could effect your brain winding down at night or winding up) or even meditation (see transcendental meditation).  Also keep writing!  "
"OK, from googling around, it's not that uncommon to work two jobs for the same company and such a person is supposed to get overtime if not salaried. Look into if the fact the Salon/School is a separate company is a loophole or not to avoid paying you overtime. The FLSA will bend the owner over a fucking barrel in legal hot water you could use to leverage better pay (or overtime), if this counts as overtime.

Go ask in /r/jobs about overtime and your work situation.

Realistically, they probably can't find anyone willing to do just the 20 hours bit by itself. That in itself might be good leverage."
"Mindfulness takes a TON of practice, and it’s especially important to practice (and I mean like, multiple times a day) at times when you’re not anxious or distressed, so that it becomes more of a reflex that you can go to when you are anxious. Literally no one is “good” at mindfulness in the beginning. 

I felt the exact same way when I started. I thought it was silly and it would never work. Now it’s one of my go-to skills, and I also employ it in my classroom with my students. I’m not saying 100% that it will work for you, or even that you have to keep doing it if you don’t want to, but I do believe that if you give it some solid time and effort and practice it will get better! Also, consider trying different mindfulness exercises if the ones you are using aren’t connecting with you - there are so many different ones. 

Good luck!"
"I feel like my parents and I are in a weird codependent environment... 

They had me young so although I got my physical needs (food, shelter, clothing, etc) met, I never really felt like my emotional needs were met, almost like they didn’t know how to be parents because they were still kids themselves, or that they cant handle my emotions.... so for that reason I feel like I am subconsciously seeking/waiting for them to be the parents I want  (need?) them to be... even though it won’t happen...

On the flip side, I notice they tend to treat my actions as personal attacks against them... and if I really dig psychologically into it, I think that they view my personal struggles, set backs and other issues as reflective of their parenting- which it isn’t necessarily. i.e. I forgot to pull my car forward to give my dad space to park behind me (I had just come back from a week long vacation- and genuinely forgot he has to park behind me now because we have too many cars)- but according to him I did that (purposefully) because I’m inconsiderate and don’t care about him (I actually just forgot!)."
"I feel that when we manifest symptoms and illnesses (like depression), we're actually embodying not only ourselves but our families and maybe even family histories. So removing ourselves from the circumstance, if possible, is great, but as you mention, that's rarely a possibility. It might be worthwhile figuring out where the boundary lies between you and them - where do their thoughts end and your own begin, their emotions and yours, and so on. This might help in creating a sort of protective barrier between you and them, allowing you more control over what comes close to you / affects you, and what doesn't. Of course, this needs a lot of psychological work and is definitely easier said than done.

At the end of the day, whether we are ""truly"" depressed, or the environment is making us feel so, we are the ones manifesting the confusion, concerns, sadness and whatever else comes with it.

But I agree that we all do need to take responsibility for ourselves and our health, but sometimes when we expect ourselves to take total control over how we feel and when is a bit much of an ask from ourselves :) "
"That last line has basically been me this whole day. I’m feeling kind of happy right now, and with the way I was feeling earlier, this little happiness has me crying a little :(. Why am I like this. I think I figured out what I have, Dysthymia. I watched some videos on it earlier that another commenter put on this thread, and they described how I feel so perfectly. As I was watching them I felt my thoughts get a little “clearer”, because I had all my feelings out into words that made sense. I don’t know why it helped so much but it did. 

Thank you. Thank you a lot. I want to thank everyone. Genuinely from the bottom of my heart thank all of you. It’s surely a very small step, one of the first, in a long trip but it makes me feel more in control having a label on what I feel. I’m still crying a bit, the fact that I got my help from people I’ve never met,  on a site that I was always told not to go on because it’s an awful place, while I’m surrounded by people who are supposed to be close to me and care for me. Well that fact makes me sad I guess, but at the same time pretty happy. "
Do the best to take care of yourself and manage what’s in your control. That’s my advice.
Does deep breathing help? I hope everything gets better for you. Sorry I wasn't much help. :(
For real. Small steps. Stay grounded in yourself. This is an amazing opportunity for growth.

Sounds like Bi-Polar Disorder but you should consult a psychiatrist or medical professional.
This is what terrifies me. It's so hard to find the right people to help with this situation.
Woah... I don’t think she has any right to be angry about someone else’s suicide attempt.
Word of advice. Make sure you know what paranoid means. People use the term way too loosely.

You have a good day too.  I understand all too well these feelings that youre dealing with.

"Can't really offer any advice but can relate to having anxiety triggered by somebody else's anxiety. Just have to go through your normal routine of dealing with anxiety and try to push it out if your mind.

For me it was 'waking' from a switch (DID) and finding my wrists all cut up from an alter sticking them through a broken window. The only reason I didn't wind up in the hospital then was a caretaker boyfriend who refused to let me be 'sucked into a broken system'. He found me a psychiatrist who then was able to diagnose the DID and start therapy.
"I had severe insomnia for years, when I finally brought it up to my GP I got prescribed Restoril, although a temporary solution it helped me get rest so that I was actually productive at work again. I slowly worked off of it and I’m now taking 2 5mg melatonin. It’s not as useful but it’s more natural and less harmful I think In the long run."
"I have my first therapy appointment this week. It's with a charity so I don't know how useful it will be. I probably do have PTSD caused by a couple of different things, throughout my life.

"I usually think about that and that's one reason why I haven't been drinking. But the cravings were really bad. 

Actually, I can name a few. 
I actually looked forward to drinking, helped my anxiety (probably just didn't care enough), and at least I could have a beer around my family or friends. 

But you are right, drinking is mostly negatives. "
"If you'd like to talk or ask questions feel free to PM me anytime, although i might take a while to answer, sorry if I come off as harsh with my comment but I'm just very protective over the kinds of illness i personally deal with, seeing people wish they had my disorders is just a little disheartening is all, knowing how hard it makes my own life"
"It does sound like bipolar, but I’m not a doctor so I can’t say that you do have it. There’s some tests online that you can take, print the answers out after you’ve done the test and give it to the doctor, I think that might help. I’m not saying the tests are always right, but it might help with the diagnosis. Please see a doctor again. "
"I’ve put thought into it but I’ve avoided scheduling anything because I figured it’s something I can deal with like past issues that are now gone. I just don’t feel “sick”. I’m generally happy, I have a healthy life at home, I don’t have trouble sleeping. But maybe it’s more serious than I think.

Anyway, any help is appreciated."
"Pyromania by Cascada pretty much explains me (and my mental state), even though the song itself is simply a metaphor for love. It still fits because if you take it literally--that is me.

Also, the song Flames by Flittzy. There are other songs that describe my Depression and Anxiety, but I can't think of any right now.

I do this ALLLLLL the time."
"You are not your diagnose. Those are just words to describe some feelings you have, but they are not you.

You still feel the same, you still look the same - you are same person with a different label. It could say ""jsjsj"" and still wouldn't change a thing.

Don't let it get to you! Few letters that don't mean anything because you're so much more!"
"Did your doctor tell you start weaning off the Effexor?

Because I've been on Effexor for a little while, and things were starting to look up in my life. But my psychiatrist was like ""Yeah, we're not even going to talk about weaning you off the Effexor until everything in your life has been perfect for like a year. So if you stop being all depressed and you stop the weed-smoking and the binge-drinking and all of that stuff for over a year, we'll reduce your dose of Effexor and see how things are. If things are still going really good for a month or two after that, we'll reduce your dose further.""

"
"Don’t worry about the fact that you waited so long to tell them. Just let them know that you have been really struggling with telling them this and all your concerns. By letting them know the symptoms you are feeling they will best be able to treat those symptoms and also properly diagnose. If you aren’t ready to share something yet that is okay also but you will just have to decide if that will outweigh the benefits you can gain from revealing that you have been suffering. 
So sorry that something so terrible and traumatizing happened to you and I hope you are able to get the help you deserve."
"Hey Tront, yes i agree. But wouldn't you say that the only reason society calls it a disorder, is because ""normal"" people simply don't understand the way we think?

For example, if a school was specifically trained to educate students with adhd, those students, subjectively, wouldn't grow up with a ""disorder"", since they know how to use their brain type to their advantage. 

The point I'm trying to get across is that you shouldn't label people with having a disorder, when its just a different way of thinking, which requires specific, tailored education in comparison to the ""normal"" way of thinking."
"My son in 7 months old.
I already receive SSDI and it's not enough to live off of neither are any cash assistance you get from the state. I'm already involved in a program through  CPS but theres a bunch of stipulations to qualify for help which I dont meet. I've done hospitalization stays and they weren't effective. And I've been on every type of medication, that's why my pyschiatrist gave up on me. And I've been in therapy for years to the point where I already know what they are going to say before they say it. I'm tired and I've heard it all. I've been there and done that. I have really tried. "
"Therapy.
Get to know yourself better by talking with a professional and get deep about your personality, the things you don't like about yourself, your strengths, how you can move forward, maybe focus a little bit on some things in your life that have been difficult. Sometimes the best way to move forward is to look into the past and what went wrong and why, so that you are better prepared for the present and the future. It can help you understand yourself better, why you do certain things that you do and how to gradually change for the better when it comes to things you don't like about yourself. "
"Diagnoses do not define you. Take it as a way psychiatrists and therapists use a system in which they are able to help you function. They need to label because labels are the only thing that bring them solutions to your problems and help you function. People can have 1 diagnosis and be much worse than you can imagine. Take it easy :) it is VERY difficult to deal with this i know and understand. Tell yourself: okay so i have more diagnoses now, that does not have to be a negative thing, that means that the people who are trying to help me know me better and are closer to finding a solution for me.
Good-luck :) breathe and smile, they understand you better! 
I have bipolar type 2, borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa. Any questions or ranting, feel free to message me if you like. I have gotten better even though i never thought i would."
"Hahaha, where have I explicitly called you a name or other sort of degrading term? I might have said that you were shitty at your job, that's it. 

Sure, it wouldn't be an issue normally, but you are on a mental health sub. Again, surely since you have nothing to fear and you already asked this same thing of someone else, PM me the details of your workplace so I can file a complaint. Unless you think asking for such things is ridiculous, and if so, perhaps you asking the same thing of someone else is a little ridiculous. 

&gt; I'm sure you do. I'm not posting my degree online.

You can easily do the same thing where you scribble out your last name, but your choice. I would not make claims you can't prove if I were you, and if you are unable to prove something with sufficient evidence after making such a bold claim, that's on you. Not me. 

&gt; I don't really care? You've not seen me at work and the feedback from our service users is more than enough to assuage me of your empty insults

You apparently did care if I believed you, you attempted to convince me initially with some image of a name tag. 
"
"First: here is a passage I really think you should read https://www.metanoia.org/suicide/ I don’t know who wrote it or even where I stumbled across it but it helped me so I hope it might do the same for you

Okay so Hey, like you said it’s just reddit and I’m obviously not qualified to give any kind of medical advice but maybe we can try and help you find a starting point to get help. Im going to ask a bunch of questions and maybe from there we can figure out what your options are. Are you in the US, if you are, do you have health insurance? You said you’re 16 are you able to drive? How are finances, would your dad be willing to pay for care? Have you ever gotten a yearly physical (many insurances cover these) if so this is a perfect opportunity to bring up to your doctor that you’re struggling and don’t know where to start. 

If you do have insurance you can sometimes go to the doctor and pay a copay and then have them bill what isn’t covered by insurance to whoever has the insurance (you/your mom/your dad). Would this be an option for you? If you don’t have insurance or your situation doesn’t allow for you to use your insurance some providers offer a sliding scale based on income it never hurts to ask what their fee would be for you. 

I know these are some pretty personal questions but answering them could help narrow down your treatment options. Getting help is scary and there is no way around that but it’s the best thing you can do for yourself. Get help now. DON’T wait until you’re in the back of a cop car being hospitalized under a 51/50. I know that when I was struggling I had the mentality that I wasn’t bad enough or that I needed to hit rock bottom before I got help and boy was I wrong. I will always regret waiting as long as I did to get help. 

I’d recommend taking your gun, knives, and any other things that you’ve thought about killing yourself with and putting them somewhere high, or maybe in a room you rarely go in. Somewhere that takes effort to get to. It’s not as good as getting rid of them but it’s something! All of the advice already posted is great I think talking to someone at your school who you think might be able to help is smart. You don’t necessarily even have to be close to them maybe they’re just a nice person or have expressed their willingness to help struggling students. Hang in there. "
All my homework and worked on my screenplay. I want to get into college and so do all of that.
Do you have the means to see a doctor? I would really recommend doing that if you're worried.

"I'm not to be honest, I wouldn't know how to go about getting one. Do you think it might help?"

Maybe try finding a bipolar specialist and tell him/her exactly what you just told all of us.

Thank you! I sure will. I even talked with my parents and they're going to help me get better!
"There's quite a bit of history of that, not so long ago being homosexual was a mental illness."
This is normal everyone has had this thoughts before. If you see your self doing them get help

"Definitely get a second opinion. Having a history of depression doesn't point to a personality disorder for me.

"I often feel as though I can't get calm enough to even use most of the ""mindfulness"" exercises I've been taught.

"I think you should take all advice you here online from strangers with a grain of salt, but it sounds like you may be have bipolar disorder.

"Sorry to leave such a late reply, but I second the borderline possibility.

"Well if you are looking for treatment options I would search by diagnosis, as each diagnosis has different treatment options. If you are looking for specific therapies you could search for CBT or DBT workbooks or studies done proving efficacy. You could search for medications by diagnosis as well and then further your search into medication classes"
"Has he had blood work done? Could be a thyroid issue or other physical cause. Is he on any medication for his mental health issues? Those often have drowsiness as a side effect. But other than that, having depression and anxiety and all that is just simply exhausting. I'm constantly fatigued, have gotten blood work done but everything's clear. However, I am on medication so it could be attributed to that as well. Other than checking side effects of medication and getting blood work done, I'd just recommend getting enough sleep, B vitamins, D3, and maybe something like Acetyl-L-Carnitine for energy. "
I don’t have an answer for you but I used to be able to binge watch tv shows for days and it was all cool. And now I sit to watch something and after a few minutes I’ll realize I have no idea what’s happening. It’s like I’m looking at the show but my brain just goes someplace else altogether and I cannot for the life of me watch anything now and actually understand it. I am able to read still but no where near the way I used to do. I told my therapist about this and she didn’t seem to know what to tell me either. How long had this been happening to you? For me it’s been several months
"I’m curious as someone in a similar situation what OP has found that they believe will facilitate success for them. Is it a different type of job than they did before? Were they able to find a better niche? Combo of these plus therapy? I’m currently unsure about my ability to sustain my chosen career, because I ended up also hospitalized for a major crisis. Also, our work environments have a significant effect on our mental health. So some environments more than others can more likely induce symptoms. Basically, a stressful job amplifies symptoms. So I’m just curious if that’s a factor too. "
"Everything in life is temporary. Pain comes, pain goes. Love comes, it goes. The problem is we dwell too much on the things that last the last amount of time. I totally get it, I've had arguments where all I've wanted to do was blow my thoughts onto the wall with red. But me and that person worked it out and moved on. Currently I am alone, so I the only person I argue with is myself and that hurts much worse to me. You two will be alright, I promise you. And even if you guys don't work it out, eventually arguments are forgotten. Words are abandoned and love persists. Nothing in life ever causes permanent pain, everything comes to an end at some point. And sure, you might tell me that dying lets that pain come to an end, but is it really worth it? Dying over a temporary problem when you can live and make amazing memories and have a good time? Hell no."
"It sounds like you are a great employer, it is nice to see that there are still good people in the world! :)  

It is a tricky question... i had a breakdown last year, a friend told me a few months ago ""I always thought of you as someone indestructible"".  

People can hide a lot of stuff for a long time.  
Or they can become suddenly mentally unwell.  

I think the most important bit is, that you should not do something that might make her distrust you.  
Which could be something like ""behind her back"", that can make people run for the hills of re-enforce their false feelings.  

Part of me wants to say, try talking about her openly about it but i do not know if that is the right thing either.  

Though situation, i think i more replied because i think it is awesome that you care about your employees health.  

Sorry if i can not offer better advice."
"I didn't go through any trauma. I didn't move to another country but just a bigger city within my own country. I understood everything teachers were saying. And still on my 4th day of going to Uni away from home I was hiding under the desk in my dorm crying.

I almost never cry and I almost never get overwhelmed but the whole experience of moving away from home and entering new educational institution is just so damn overwhelming it broke me.

My point? This is a perfectly normal way to feel.

I bet everyone in your class who moved to Korea recently feels this way. 

Do you think you can handle it a few more days and then decide? It really does get a lot easier with time, so if a few days for now you feel exactly the same way as you do now then it's not just an adjustment period but it's simply not something for you.

Your friends and family don't care if you learn Korean or not, they just want you to be happy. I am sure that your parents would be very relieved if you came home early because parents worry so much when their kid is in a foreign country.

You are not letting anyone down if you are making the best choice for your mental health and happiness.

There's a blog HangukDrama written by a Singaporean woman who went through a very similar experience. She even knew a lot of Korean beforehand, but still she regretted her decision, couldn't eat while she was there and she returned home after a few days. I didn't judge her. I admire her.

I think reading her short blog entry about her decision to [withdraw from classes and leave Korea](http://www.hangukdrama.com/첫-단추를-잘못-채웠을-땐/) might help you.


P.S. I totally agree that learning a new language in the said language is needlessly difficult. I am self-studying Korean, and I know Korean language is the last thing on your mind right now, but if you ever need help just send me a message"

Today, the DSM-V manual lists over 300 different mental disorders but we still only have a handful of lab tests for any of them.  Most mental disorders are diagnosed the way they were over 100 years ago: symptomatology. "
"Thank you. She has had CBT sporadically over the years and had a hospital stay in the Spring. She’s been medicated for about 11 years, but it’s not helping. I’m struggling so much to cope with this and hope she will be able to get into this program, and more importantly that she has just enough shreds of hope left to try. Trying not to give up"
"This actually made me cry.

If I could see a future where I'm happy and loved and everything is perfect I don't think I would be suicidal. In fact, I don't think I would have anxiety either. The depression is inevitable, yes, but everything else comes with the fear and the unknowing. I think many people would feel the same though.

A girl can dream."
"This sounds a lot like my Aunt. She is going through the same thing, and is living with my cousin out of state now. Goodness, she needs to take her meds...I am not sure how you would make sure of that but it sounds like she really needs them. I wish you and her luck and love. I hope she can see her way back to her medication and peace for you. &lt;3"
"This sounds... Intense I've gone through apathy before but this sounds worse, HMU if you need some help mate... 

Btw I totally get the whole ""everything is pointless literally the only reason I'm acting this way is so that I'm not asked what's wrong because everything's wrong the whole world sucks"" thing, I generally get weard when tired or hungry."
"Yup. All of my future appointments with my psych were canceled so they could be given to ""patients who need it more."" In the meantime I'm fighting the worst anxiety and suicidal thoughts I've had in a very long time. But I'm a practicing attorney who presents as extremely calm, professional, and totally OK 90% of the time, so I guess I don't count. "
"Tell me about it, I literally just quit my job after 14 years as was so sick of having to explain myself all the time. Why shouldn’t you be able to phone up and just say you feel mentally unwell without feeling like you’re being judged all the time or just feigning illness. Honestly, there’s been days I’ve gone to work after the most horrendous events but I honestly think they thought I just wanted to skive off. I don’t like feeling like this, but actually since quitting on Friday I’ve felt an enormous sense of relief. I feel like a couple of months downtime will do me the world of good. "
"Thank y'all for the responses, my friend is receiving professional help but not much has changed since that started and the support system is burning out quickly, I can't speak for everyone, but I will not give up the fight since this person is my dearest friend. I agree that I can't encourage the realism of the delusions and/or hallucinations, and I have been discounting anything I am able to. 

I'm mostly just heartbroken because I know this is a lifelong mental disorder, and every case is so different. Finding the right treatment plan will be tiresome, but I am hopeful we can find one that works. "
"I agree with the first response.... I’m not exactly sure what you’re asking for. And a diagnosis (which only a mental health professional would be able to accurately give) would perhaps be the only way to help your friends... as it would more accurately depict the type of treatment he needs... 

For example... he could be suffering from borderline personality disorder in which the course of treatment usually involves dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT) and antipsychotic medication. 

Or he could be suffering from bipolar I... in which the course of treatment typically involves a mood stabilizer medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 

Two similar but different courses of treatment for two very different mental disorders. 

So, I would have to say that a proper diagnosis is the best way to go about helping your friend. 


Best of luck.

"All I could say about all the feelings is, you should not play around with drugs that could potentially make it worse. The way you describe it looks like a dissociative problem, which could be aggravated by drug use, or here, more like withdrawals. I really would consult a doctor if I was you, preferably a psychiatrist. There are good docs who will not judge you about the drugs you took, and a actually help you get rid of those weird feelings, on the long term instead of for a short period of time like with heroin. 
You would benefit from medication, therapies if needed and support from support groups if you ask to get helped. There is better solutions, there really are. And less costly than the illegal road you took. I know it isn't the easiest step to ask for professionnal help, but when you done that first step, the rest becomes easier.

Be careful with the drug use though, not every seller has good ethics... So you could end up with heroin that is actually fentanyl and could possibly harm you seriously. Also, you should at least ask a pharmacist to get you a naloxone kit. Naloxone is a medication that can quickly reverse the effects of an overdose from opioids such as heroin, morphine, fentanyl, carfentanil, and codeine.

Hope my answer was good for you. I don't want to sound judging or anything, just want my fellow redditers safe.

Take care dude!"

Hey dude you might wanna try posting on r/makenewfriendshere. I've met some decent people there.
"I agree, its fucking horrible, and the  picture of the girl with big massive eyes, just fuck off"
I am told to do that on a daily basis by others. However I still obtain some type of optimism.
I'll talk to my counselor about it. It's just frustrating because I only have one semester left.
It can be. Disorientation is a symptom that should never be ignored. Glad you are getting help.
It has been about 6 years since I cut my arms up so I’m comfortable not covering them up now.
"Many primary care docs are comfortable prescribing these meds as well, if you already have one. "
Oh no that’s not good. This test is meant to pinpoint an exact drug. So disappointed for you.
"Sounds like dissociation, a common occurrence in trauma survivors. This happens to me a lot too."
Thank you mate. I'm in a dark place as it is. You have made it just a little brighter. Thank you
We have the same situation too. I wasn't able to cry also even though my 2 brothers passed away.
Well he can kill it but that would take a lobotomy and nobody wants their front cortex destroyed
What exactly is borderline personality disorder? Google is useless and I have always wondered...
"Yeah I understand, sounds cool!

How do you mean he or she aggressively attacks it? sounds cool!"
You need to get help for this if you haven't already. It's the only way you'll ever feel better.
You’re only bettering yourself. We are all proud of you and glad you’re on the right track!
"Do you care about yourself? If you don’t care about yourself you can’t care about others. When I was in my deepest depression I didn’t care about my family, but as my care for myself and my self-esteem grew, my family has become the most important thing to me. Now if you’re family is toxic in some way that’s a different story. All the best."
I guess it's just hard because I've destroyed some really important relationships and I can't get them back even if I do get better at having them. One of my absolute best friends walked away from a bad 20min conversation and I guess it's just looming over me and talking about it and why I keep messing up is really hard but I know it needs to happen.
"Most people, even with their many struggles, live their lives with joy and excitement and sorrow and....etc. They feel the emotions and are excited or terrified by life. But they LIVE it.

Again thankyou x "
"There isn't really a ""why"" afaik - Depression just sucks. 

Stick to the things that *should* make you happy based on your previous experience. It's super frustrating when an action isn't as satisfying as it should be, but making attempts to make yourself happy, and not dwelling on being angry with your feelings, does gradually help your well being. "

"Usually when I am so charged up that I feel like I am going to self-harm, all my systems are in ""shut down"" mode. I don't really hear, see, feel, think...all I know is that cutting brings pain, which then makes me feel again, and everything goes back to ""normal"".

"I am not an MD, so I will not make any recommendations about medications, as that is far outside of the scope of my field, which is psychology.

I will say that medications can become less effective after many years of usage, which might be the case.  

I would consult with a psychiatrist about updating your treatment plan and medication regimen, as your symptoms are reemerging.  

Also, I know it sucks to switch doctors, especially after you've been going to the same one forever, but sometimes a fresh pair of eyes can be beneficial.  What type of doctor has been prescribing the sert and wellbutrin?  "
"No I get what you mean. The way we see ourselves looks different in photos because the mirror is a reverse image of ourselves that we see almost everyday. You get used to seeing yourself a certain way so when you see a photo it’s almost like a shock.

I’m sorry you got bullied. It’s such a shitty thing to go through. I do think that your self esteem could be part of why you hate taking photos and seeing yourself in photographs. I’m not really qualified to give any advice as I’m struggling with the same thing, but I hope you know you’re not alone! Hopefully we can both get over this fear :)"
"This. The metaphor I always give is it’s like being color blind. You don’t know what the colors you can’t see look like. You couldn’t. But then you put on some of those color blind glasses and you become aware of what you’ve been missing. 

How do you know what you don’t know? You can’t. Survivors of trauma often have lived so long and and entrenched in their new life (after the trauma) that they can’t be aware of how it’s impacted them. 

But that also doesn’t necessarily mean the therapist is correct in this case either. Work collaboratively. Ask why they think its trauma based. "
"We all felt like you at 13, isolated,  no friends,  not understanding what is the good out of this but let me tell you school is a boring place. You need to focus on things you like to make this moment pass. At the university you will love the liberty!

Entertain yourself with only positive motivating things.

"i think it’s normal.... for people who have like depression and stuff. i suffer with fear of abandonment so for me it’s easier to just feel in control &amp; cut ties before they can up and leave. i get so tired of people easily. whenever i feel my effort in the friendship is not equal i cut it off. it’s mentally exhausting to keep friends to be honest. i have a select few that have stuck around but we don’t communicate much. it’s so much easier to be alone, in my opinion. i don’t really think it’s healthy considering we are designed to be social beings, but it really isn’t horrible... "
"the medication will not make the reasons go away. the meds should be paired with therapy - that is the optimal treatment for a major depressive episode. you need to talk through the reasons and learn some coping techniques, maybe go through some CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy)  depending on your situation. Also overall healthy habits also help more then we give credit. regular sleep schedule, regular meals, a morning and nighttime routine. excercise also pumps happy chemicals in your body.

"Ok, this might be way off base, but are you on birth control? It sounds as if you may be experiencing severe hormonal imbalances during PMS, which can exacerbate an underlying depression. Some forms of birth control can definitely help control these symptoms by regulating your hormone levels. I'd for sure talk to a doctor about what you're experiencing, because this is definitely NOT a normal part of PMS. As for the counseling, there are ways you can find it if you're hard up for money. If you're in school, there's always a student mental health center. I personally have Medicare, so my psychiatry and counseling appointments are always free, as are my meds. Do some research, there's almost always an option out there for you. I've spent the last few years going through similar stuff, so message me if you need any advice or have any questions. Good luck!"
"This is why depression is so insidious -- it affects everything. A problem with your knees won't stop you from wanting to get help with your knees, but a problem with your brain can make you not want to get help with your brain.

What's stopping you may feel like an invisible force, but there's a good chance you can figure out what it is if you spend some time thinking about it. This is worth a try.

Another more practical piece of advice I could give is just to make it a routine. Every X weeks you go to the therapist, and that's that. If you have to change an appointment because of vacation or something, then don't cancel it, just change the date. Always have an appointment on the calendar.

If you can, try to avoid using terms like ""suck it up"" when talking to yourself. People with depression can rarely just do this, that's also part of the disease. "
"You could find a job that gives you some sort of benefit and/or allows you to be creative (ie part time at a craft store or art supply store where they sell pottery stuff) and then do pottery part time on the side- teach classes, go to farmers markets and sell your stuff. You could open an Etsy store and sell your pottery on there as well (while working another job part time). 

I think the key here is balance. I’m not discouraging you by any means to not pursue pottery, but, it might be a little unsteady if you jump right in without a backbone or backup plan. I think sometimes people (myself included) forget that even our passions require hard work and dedication, and can even create difficulties at first. Don’t give up, but find a way to balance your passion with the real word until you’re stable enough to pursue it full time! 

Best of luck :)"
"You can check colleges to see if there are sliding scale with therapist interns getting their hours. I had an intern and they’re eager to help and can be really good at what they do. Sometimes they show up on a Psychology Today site search. 
As far as your employer- there’s no way they find out unless you tell them. 
I understand the worry of a diagnosis on your file but your therapist typically will discuss it with you before they report it so you can say if you feel comfortable with it. I don’t think insurance will care much about an anxiety diagnosis. I think they care more about what they consider chronic or long term situations like Bipolar or other disorders that require lifetime medication and sometimes recurring hospitalizations. AKA: expensive. 
I think you should go the insurance route so you can get the best help possible with just your copay. However sounds $60 is really cheap for a therapist. They typically run $80-150. 
And... the state of healthcare in this country... don’t get me started! 
I hope any of this was helpful. Feeling stuck with no help is the worst. Good luck to you! "
"How long were you on 10 mg and how long have you been on 20 mg?

It could be a direct side effect of the medication but I think it’s more likely related to lack of sleep. 

If you are waking up you are probably not getting sufficient restful (full REM sleep) even though you say you are sleeping for seven hours.

Does your doctor know you are taking the melatonin? If not I recommend you stop it especially since you are unsure of the dose. 

You need to tell your doctor about ANYTHING else you are taking. They need to know if it will cause problems. Even if it might help, changing multiple things at once (upping you fluoex dose, potentially not taking enough time to adjust, then adding melatonin) can make it impossible to determine what is causing your problem.

I had a horrible case of poison ivy a few weeks ago. I got put on steroids briefly. The doctor that prescribed them had my full list of psych meds but didn’t indicate that there was any concern over adding the steroids. I was off the steroids for at least two weeks when I had an appointment with my psychiatrist. I told him that a new medication that had been really helping seemed to be having less of an effect. We decided to up the dose. I was leaving when I mentioned the poison ivy. He asked if I was given steroids. I said yes but that I felt fine then. He said not only could they have caused a DELAYED impact to the effects of my psych meds, but that it could have been permanent. Like they might have been enough to knock my previous good mood out of balance and even if I tried to wait it out after stopping them it might not go back to being just right. It’s possible that it wasn’t just my body getting used to the new psych med, the steroids could have forced me to adjust my meds. No way of knowing for sure, but that’s why you always tell your doctor everything that’s going on with you.

I might suggest that you be checked for Adult ADD. Not ADHD. Attention deficit disorder without the hyperactivity component.

The Standard Model and Quantum Field theory strongly counterindicate any and all of the absurd unprovable claims.  Concrete studies show worse mental health outcomes with the judgement and illogical approach you are preaching.

"Missing multiple appointments can result in this due to waiting lists, but if you've only missed the one, give the reception a call and leave a message explaining you were experiencing negative side effects from the initial titration of medication.

"Thanks, it's so hard to trust your thoughts/feelings on abuse when you question your thoughts and feelings.  I've been in trauma therapy for 6 months, but I've received little confirmation of abuse because they've focused so much on dissociation.

"You're correct, my choice of words was poor. I meant to say that ASPD, NPD, and BPD are recognizable by name, but there's no question that the general populace is *grossly* misinformed about them. It's disgusting that people with those disorders are stereotyped as psychopathic or evil rather than individuals deserving of professional help and respect."
"I can relate to an extent. I've dealt with identity problems when I was younger. Never truly knowing who the real me was. I would put on different masks and personalities around other people. And I'd pretend to be somebody I wasn't. 

You need to find a way to let this stuff out in a safe space. Maybe then you'll find yourself and realize who you truly are. Also, if you haven't already, go see a therapist. They might be able to help you with these issues. But always remember that only you can figure out who you really are. And some people change personalities throughout their life. It's not unheard of."
"It's mostly placebo effect / religious-style thinking. Placebo because, whatever else it may or may not do, you get the feeling that you have some control. The illusion is important, even if nothing else is. Since it is cheap and otherwise not harmful most of the time it is popular. The medical model around pharmaceuticals prevents literal placebo drugs from being publicly acknowledged so mindfulness is the next best thing.

It's religious thinking because it's theories aren't solvable. If mindfulness doesn't work you just aren't doing it correctly in some way (including not trying it for long enough)."
"Sorry you had to deal with that.

You school should have an ombudsperson, dean liaison or similar person you can go to in order to provide feedback on this. I would do that and see what happens.

"That is exactly what this post was born of. I was reading the original article and then read the comments. HORRIBLE. I was truly appalled. Person after person going on about how selfish she was.

"I have both anxiety and depression. When I find myself in a funk, if I can trace it directly back to something that worries me, I know my anxiety has kicked in and I handle that particular thing. If I trace it back to something that makes me sad, I know that this is a situational  sadness, I'm sad becuz a particular thing happened. If I'm not worried and no real sadness to trace it back to, I know this is a real depression, which is a chemical malfunction in my brain. Becuz it is not linked to anything in particular I have choices when it comes to remedies: see my counselor, pray, journal, yoga/meditate, or get into nature (hiking, biking and walking are my faves. I've recently started riding my bike at night. I like on a lake and its mesmerizing).  I find that my anxiety, situational sadness or depression sadness test helps me a lot.
Hope it helps you."
"I hope that things will start getting better for you soon. Have you found a local support group for trans or any LGBT? Or do you have supportive friends? It's frustrating to think that a parent want to put conditions on their love for you and may possibly make you leave their home for just wanting to be yourself. 

Check with your therapist and see if they have some resources for you or know where there is a support group because you may need to build up a group of people that can help you out if things get really bad. Also your therapist may have resources on how to get insurance or other public assistance if you ended up needing those services.

I know this can be difficult, but there are people out there that will support you and want to see you happy being yourself. Good luck and I hope that you will get the support you need during your transition.

"I will say that if you have any chest pain, it's best to see your doctor to rule out any heart related issues. And if you find yourself getting irrationally angry or anxious, it may be a good idea to mention that to your doctor as well.

Now that my unsolicited advice is out of the way, yeah intense anger and anxiety can in some cases cause pain and tightness in the chest, along with a racing heart. I've had a few panic attacks that were so excrutiatingly painful I honestly thought I was having a heart attack, but doctor tested my blood and confirmed that I did not. I've read that the actual speeding up of the heart is not supposed to damage it, but some studies suggest that large surges of adrenaline (epinephrine) may cause some short-term damage. Stress is a killer, try to manage your stress and anxiety now while you're young, make good mental habits."
"I'm not an admin here or anything so this is just my opinion but I think this place is for you to discuss anything you like if you think it will help you make some progress with your mental health. I wouldn't mention any names of people in your life etc. but other than that I think it's pretty open with regards to what is ""acceptable"".

You won't get a diagnosis here (and if you do, you shouldn't give it much credit) but you will likely find that at least one person can relate to what you're going through and offer you some advice.

The most common and helpful response I see here is usually along the lines of ""I went through something very similar and I got professional help and treatment X, Y, Z and X worked great for me but Y and Z not so much"" - that kind of thing.

So go ahead and share, and see if the kind of support you get here is helpful to you."
"I've been on them for so many years that I hardly remember the first time I took it.

The biggest feeling I remenbered was sheer disappointment. I was 11 at the time, and I thought that it would basically make me immune to teen angst and make me love the world in a way that I thought I used to.

It didn't do that, needless to say. But for the first few weeks, you get some side effects which vary a lot between people. Usually digestive stuff, like upset stomach. Possibly even some headaches. If you start on a small dose with the supervision of your psychiatrist, you're in good shape.

If you feel like you're reacting poorly to them you should get in touch with your doctor ASAP and try to get an earlier appointment if at all possible. They may decide to put you on a different SSRI.

In the end, it's a ton of experimentation. This isn't the cure phase yet."
"Sorry.  I can empathize with the cost of mental health care in the US.  I currently spend between 25% and 33% of my take home pay on therapy. Therapist does not accept insurance,  which I do have.   Went for many years to the wrong type of  therapy that was not helping and really just masking a problem that only got worse.  Now I will gladly pay what I am paying for saving my life and starting to give me a life back.  I am fortunate that my present living arrangement allows me to do so.  

While in many cases,  seeing any therapist is better than nothing,  be aware that the wrong type of therapy may not help and could actually  make a problem worse.  And not all therapists are equal.  You have to find the balance between doing your own research and being your own advocate and finding a therapist that works for you.  I hope you get what you need.  Peace."
"Don't worry about what you think you might have - focus on the symptoms and just be honest with your therapist about all of them.

There are so many nuances and crossovers to the various symptoms of different diagnoses, and often it's the severity of them which is most important, which you can't gauge by yourself due to only having one data point for comparison.

Self diagnosing will just tempt you to paint your symptoms in a light that matches what you think you have. Leave the diagnosis to the professionals and let them work out what is wrong with you.

Also, most qualified professionals don't really like it when somebody comes to them for their expertise and starts by telling them their own job, so on a purely personal level that might not be the best strategy as it might start you on the wrong foot.

Not trying to chastise you in any way - it's great that you're looking at what the various conditions are and educating yourself, but you'll have more success going into this without expectations and an open mind.

I hope therapy goes well for you. It may also be worth seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist."
"Hello there!  I know how scary it can be when you have health issues but also have to maintain a hectic school schedule.  Last year I started grad school and was FREAKING out because of the schedule.  My whole life I've basically been on ""attendance contracts"" (from missing too much class) due to health issues.  So what I went to disability resources at my school.  I laid it all out for the adviser, told her about how I was constantly getting sick, explained my mental health struggles as well.  All she asked for was a couple of health records, and she was able to give me accommodations like extended due dates, and flexible attendance.  She then sent a letter to all of my professors letting them know these were my accommodations (she did not tell them why), and when she does that the professors have to abide by it.  My responsibility from there was if I needed an extension on an assignment, or couldn't come to class, I would have to email my professors.  

I highly suggest you look for something like this at your university.  I am in the US so it might be different if you're in a different country.  Also, see if you can take any of your required courses online.  That could make a HUGE difference for you if your university has online classes!

Wish you the best, hope everything goes well and you're able to stick to engineering and have a speedy recovery! :)"
"Im no therapist man but I don't trust or ""glorify"" (probably using it wrong) my partner, I've been cheated on in those exact scenarios you describe, being kicked from the party and 'bae' 'cutting loose' when I leave, I was able to see what happened when someone told me I should see something on snapchat. I only say this because I dont want anyone else going through that shit, she may seem to be the only thing that can calm you down or relax you, but you dont know what goes down when your gone.
I cant give you direct advice, but whenever it comes to partying and drugs and booze, relationships seem to suffer, and I don't want you feeling that shes beyond that as this person that makes you happy when nothing else can, because if shes that important and say she does something like that, it's gonna suck, alot.
Im sorry to bring up something that could could make you more anxious, but if theres the possibility of something like that happening, you shouldnt be feeling like your not good enough for this person or devaluing yourself.
Dont let your relationship to someone define your self worth, especially when drugs/artificial coping mechanisms are involved.
Idk man just seeing that she lied to you I don't trust, most of the time with lies theres more than one, and dubbing you on time you guys were supposed to have together; it just doesnt seem all that much that she is even setting the relationship as a priority.
My first girlfriend was a benzo addict, ""cutting loose"" I've heard that before more times than I can count. Too much of the party life revolves around relying on drugs and other (often unreliable) people to cope with stress.
I hope things get better for you man but right now it doesn't seem to be a healthy nor stable setting, you gotta evaluate the people around you and weigh the good and bad they have for you and decide if theyre worth it. Stay safe man.

yes. great phrasing."

"I love romance, fantasy, and comedy! I am actually trying to find a new series to read right now. "
"I second this, he's a troll and says some pretty disgusting things. Just look at his post history."
I started taking them 10 years after being diagnosed and I can say they have definitely helped me.
I'd say the best thing you can do is learn a few coping strategies to deal with these situations.
"I'm sorry, but I need it for as long as possible! I'll send you some if I manage to stay this way."
It’s interesting how so many people on Reddit  assume posters are male. This happens to me also.
Not everyday but I do Yoga a few times a week at night.  The easy Yoga not the tough stuff.  Heh!
Thank you for your response. Good days should never be used as a reason to dismiss your bad days.
"That would be appreciated, sir. I'll send you a message tomorrow or whenever suits you. Thank you."
The more time you spend with professionals the more diagnoses you get. It doesn't mean much to me.
"Well, you see, killing people is a bad idea, even if you move for pragmatic only reasons you know?"
Yeah I have that same habit too. Just open up about how you really feel and you should be alright.
Yeah not having a job sucks. But having a job that sucks the life out of you isn't even worth it.

Have you tried listening to some songs? maybe that'll work.

Lol at your mother for arguing with a 14 year old, hahaha.

Arguing with people is a waste of time, just ignore them.

Try to figure out things on your own, we don't know you, we can't help you. You need to rely on yourself. "
Defiantly my two best friends. Also my dad is gonna breed his Golden Retrivers when Annie is old enough and I get too pick any puppy I want. So having something else too take care of will distract me form how miserable I am deep down. I already picked out names and am slowly collecting things. I'm very excited and it's really helping me stay positive.
"For some people, the best path to thriving has been understanding what's going on in their head better than they did before. For some people, that means finding conditions that explain that to them in a way that allows them to make progress in their lives.

The only thing you can do is find a way to thrive. And not make judgements on how others thrive."
I actually emailed them the other day to see if they would be willing to give away a few subscriptions on here as a PR move. They politely declined but did say that people could get in touch with them on an individual basis and they could try and work something out. I found the pack for anxiety particularly helpful. The basics are still awesome though.
"I'm sorry you are feeling so badly. If you don't already have one, it sounds like it would be really helpful for you to find a therapist you can talk to about all this. The only way to be happy is to find and be your true self. Most of us are unhappy because we try to be someone else. Find you and be you, and then you can flourish. I wish you the best!"
"It's mainly a huge part of dialectal behavior therapy, which tries to get you to be aware of your emotions and behaviors in the moment. I'm personally not a big advocate for it simply because when people are already worked up, dwelling on the fact that you are in that state of mind isn't really a coping strategy at all. It works for some people though."
Ketamine is probably the most promising novel depression treatment to emerge in the past decade or more. Ditto MDMA for PTSD and attachment disorders. Still needs a ton more research but as someone working in mental health and suffering from depression thank you for the recommendation! We all hope this works as well as initial trials may be suggesting.
"My comment (to you) was absolutely on point as well. OP was concerned about an age gap, you jumped on the sexism train immediately without even touching on her concerns. 

With all due respect, it absolutely is you, and people just like you with similar ways of thinking, who immediately disregard the actual point and begin spewing your SJW bullshit. 

"
"My current one the psychiatrist I was seeing at the time recommended the place--I got lucky with the person.

I have definitely utilized sites like Psychology Today though and would recommend that. Just remember that if you don't connect with the therapist you choose it is ok to find someone else, it is so important to feel comfortable with the person."
"My last therapist was good but a little too New Agey for me.  Therapists have specialties and his was: success, motivation, career climbing, etc.   Not really what I was interested in but again, good maybe for someone else.

I have a therapist now who is more my style and deals in what I want to deal in.   I did have to go on a waiting list to get her."
"Ok. I'm bored of engaging someone who is intent on being an utter assclown. 

&gt;I mean... What you can do at this point is either realise that you're probably arguing with a professional and there is a deep gulf between your knowledge and mine... Or assume I'm a liar, despite providing the proof you requested... And thus, there's no point continuing."
"Talk to someone about this friend, before those daydreams morph into thoughts, and those thoughts morph into attempts.  I have been here...I know what you mean. Please go find someone you trust and tell them you are feeling wonky and you need to talk. It is hard to talk about it, but it may help you feel better.  


I am sending you so much love. &lt;3"
"The threat of suicide is often a manipulation strategy as in, ""if you don't do it my way, I will kill myself and it will be your fault"".

My therapist simply says ""Whatever is going to happen, is going to happen"".   What you don't do is cave it under the constant threats of suicide.  Neither encourage nor discourage it.  If the worst happens, dial 911."
"This is what I've been feeling. I've been trying to meditate and clear my thoughts but then when my thoughts are ""clear"" it opens my mind up to ""well what should I be thinking about, what's not thinking mean, if I'm not thinking about anything then what is my brain doing....and on and on and on"" so I feel like it's definitely bringing me more anxiety. "
"I completely agree on trying a new therapist. but depression isn't really something a therapist can ""fix"", that's got to be something you should definitely talk to a psychiatrist about and find if you need medication or not. but seeing a therapist to talk things out is still probably greatly helpful. I say in my comment above, but I thought I had ""gotten over"" my depression when I was in high school, and after 16 years, I'm coming to realize that it doesn't go away, it comes and goes in ""waves"" but if your brain isn't working properly, it's just not working properly. the earlier you find out the better."
"I haven't been single in 20 years and recently went through a rough separation with my stbxw.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not easy man, the first 6 months were hell. I had to take time off from work and suffered major depression and a schizophrenic break. I'm better now. Living on my own. Life is not so bad now. I see my kids 3 days a week and the ex and I are still friends.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said I have decided to never get married again and thus far have not persued any relationships. Maybe ina  few years, but I'm happy working to care for my kids, I don't need a woman to make things complicated again."
"I recommend seeing a counselor as number one. 

Second, I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad idea to put school on hold right now. I’m not sure how far you are in your curriculum but I would expect that your credits should be usable for several years? 

One option that comes to mind is to see if you may be eligible to sit for a CNA or LPN exam. You might then be able to get a job in a hospital which would have benefits, and then you could probably get the rest of your nursing degree paid for through them. Meanwhile you could save up money to get out of what sounds like a pretty toxic environment. "
"The APA and state licensing boards disagree with you. We're all totally allowed to make these types of recommendations in this manner.  

I also have no idea what petal means. You're clearly much more familiar with online flaming than I am.

You've already called me an idiot, but I hope you don't think I'm stupid enough to give out personal information online. You can attribute that decision to fear of getting in trouble if you want.

I get that you love arguing online. I don't. I regret most of this actually, haha. This'll be my last comment. I really hope you figure out where all this is coming from.
"
"What kind of painkillers? I tried to off myself by overdosing on Tylenol, it was not fun. I thought I'd peacefully fall asleep but instead threw up like crazy and was eventually taken to the hospital, and after that locked up in a psych ward. 

To answer your question, if I had two weeks to live I'd go to a restaurant I can't afford and order delicious food and champagne/wine. I'd try LSD. Mmm this isn't realistic but I'd love to take out some real scumbags if I had a gun, vigilante style. And maybe I'd fly to Tuscany or somewhere beautiful on my last days. 

Whatever you choose to do, good luck to you!"
"You've made a lot of bad decisions.  You have excuses for every one if them.  You can continue to walk the path you've been walking, or take responsibility for your train wreck of a life and start the long walk out.  You're down, but not out.  Decide what/who/where you want to be and get to it.  Even if you change your mind on who you want to be, well that's life.  The only constant is change.  How you deal with it is what shapes your life.  Hope is not fading, you're letting it slip through your fingers.

So what do you do?  Where do you go?

Fuck if I know, but you need to get yourself better organized.  Figure out your resources.  See what help is available to you.  Get a job and go to work.  Money rarely makes a situation worse.  Temp agencies are a resource for employment.  

You're deep, and it's going to take a shit ton of digging to get out of the hole you've stuffed yourself into.

See what mental health resources, employment resources, and other social services are available.  The use them.  

Remember, you can't always choose what help you get, but you can choose how best to use it.

Good luck."
"he's a grown-ass man, and threatens to kill himself because someone rejects him? that's some immature, high-school level bullshit and it's extremely horrible and manipulative. how dare he put you in that position honestly. if he's willing to force you to spend the rest of your life wracked with guilt over something that isn't your fault, then i don't think he cares about you as much as he claims. if he's really your friend and cares about you then he should want you to be happy, not try to manipulate you into being with him by pulling this guilt-tripping BS. there are soooo many worse problems to have in this world than ""oh no, this person doesn't like me back!"". like, grow the fuck up. he'll get over it eventually. and if he doesn't..? well... then i guess he'll spend the rest of his life miserable because someone didn't like him back that one time when he was in his 20s? which is pretty idiotic imo. if he has mental health issues that he's struggling with, ok that sucks and he needs to seek help. but to put those issues on you? burden you with the blame? no, i'm sorry but he is now an asshole in my eyes"
"Yes, it is not only ""possible"", but it is ""likely"". Think about all the successful people in the world. You think they got where they are by being happy 24/7? No...Not a chance. Life is a see-saw, the only time the game stops is when we have no one else to play with. Picture you one one end, and ""Everyone else"" on the other....Without you...""We"" can't play anymore...and that's not fair to you or us...Depression is normal...You can manage it while still holding your head high. Hey, you've made it this far, why not keep going a little longer?

&amp;#x200B;

Value is often given to people by outsiders, based on how they perceive you. That is wrong and is an extremely inaccurate way to see things. The true value lies from within and can be determined by the abundance of self esteem, confidence, motivation, or lack there of, that we have and portray. If you see yourself as nothing, you will portray yourself as nothing and others will treat you like nothing. What you must do is look in the mirror, find the positive traits you possess, and promote them daily. Every minute of every hour, just be you, love who you are, and never let anyone place value on you, as your worth has already been determined by you...and only you.

"firstly, you are a resilient person, regardless of whether you realize it or not! posting this on reddit IS a coping strategy, and seeking support is a definite step in the right direction. 

It seems like your dad makes all the big decisions in your life, and you constantly work to meet his expectations. I just want to note how BIG of a moment it is that you've realized that what he has done to you IS abusive. He might be suffering from his own trauma, but he has no right to take it out on you. It's also huge that you're shifting your focus from his expectations, to your own expectations of yourself. That's a sign of maturity and maybe the first step in healing.

If you think getting a part-time job is the right thing to do...go for it. It's a great idea. It might be nice to just work for a year anyways and take a break from the stress of nursing school. You could also stay in nursing school, but take out student loans if you wanted? depending on where you live. 

It's going to be scary making these big ""adult"" decisions for the first time in your life. It'll feel uncomfortable and there will be probably be a fair bit of conflict because of it. But you will also learn immensely from it and grow as a person. Don't wait until you're 30-40 to deal with this stuff. do it now. follow that annoying little voice at the back of your head. also get a therapist! :)"
"Being depressed it not only about being suicidal, or sad, or incapable to function in daily life. Yes depression can present that way in some of us. But in others, or even in the same person at different time, it presents different. 

Others cleats symptoms may be: 
- excessive angry/hate-guilt against your self (you said you hate your self)
- feeling ""lonely or isolated"" (you fear your friends are not real/close/caring enough to accept you if you are not ""as depressed as them"".
- numbness or feeling empty, even more when you are not reacting emotionally to something that should provoque an emotional response on you (you said you are going through something that should make you feel bad, but you don't feel anything). 
- feeling that ""you are not enough"" (you look like you feel like you are not even ""enough"" depressed :( ). 

And as an other poster said, a common trick of depression is exactly this: it convince your self that you are just ""weak"", you ""overreact"", you are just ""lazy"", ""a mess"", ""pathetic"", ""a drama queen"", ""attention seeker"". 
Well it's all false. 
Is your depression tricking you. Don't listen to it! :) 

I mean... you look pretty depressed to me. Depression is different for everyone that experience it, and in any case it feels SHITTY. I totally get the romantic part, where it ""should be"" very ""strong sad feelings"", but that's just not how depression works (at least not for everyone). Lot of us also experience it as numbers, emptiness, insatisfaction. And it sucks. And IT'S depression. And we, and you, deserve to just be happy. So you deserve the help, the therapy, the meds you are taking. 

"
"Like everyone here I can just speak for myself. I used to think I was doomed. Grew up in a suburban, happily average, upper class family and only learnt it's not normal to have sex with your dad when I was eight. My whole life crashed and burnt when I realized what was going on. After being saved from a pedophile rapist father, my parents divorced, I lost all my friends and went mute.

But this whole process helped me put things into perspective. The world is relative. It's not only what you see, but at least 50% what looks through your eyes. You can paint the healed new world black, but you can also live in a bliss of love when your surroundings are giving you hell. We don't know what this universe is, who we are and what is actually going on. Time is a construct. The past is lost forever, the future is a social construct. There is just one moment - right now. It's not a question of knowing better one day or American dream bullshit. It's the underlying fact that we know nothing and cannot even trust our senses or reason. Everything is indifferent. There is no good or bad in this world. Not even sure there is definite world.

Curiosity is the reason I didn't kill myself. If you want to have what humans call a normal life (job,family, property, structure) I have no idea what you can do. The only things that saved me was letting go of all judgement, becoming transparent and neutral towards everything. I fulfill my body's needs and stick around every day, to see what happens. I have no expectations, but meanwhile have found peace, an underlying love for existence and motivation. Optimistic Nihilism I guess... "

Yeah I no longer feel comfortable talking to any of my family members like that and I've sort of ran out of reliable/real friends to go to over this stuff. I was thinking about trying to just write it down but I feel like it's pointless to even try. I don't feel like anything is going to make me less angry. Hopefully everything works out for you though
"Yeah I space out all the time. Tbh feel like where ever I go is better than this crap fest.

"&gt; it really hurts. It makes me feel like even more of a loser

This sounds like a really difficult feeling to process. I think it's something very important that you need to work on. Having a therapist who brings out these feelings is actually a great opportunity imo as it gives you a safe way to directly address the issue.

You should absolutely discuss this with her.

I'm speaking from experience here to a degree. I've been through a number of therapists and had issues with 1 - similar to what you describe here. With hindsight I wish I'd taken the opportunity to work through those issues with her.

"I cut out most carbs. Basically, I stopped eating all highly processed grains and white rice. I also cut out sugars, including soda. I switched to Zevia, which is an awesome carbonated water that actually tastes like soda. I eat a lot of eggs, meat and cheeses. Greens, berries and melons. 

My energy level has increased, I’m not dragging myself out of bed in the morning. I used to need a 10 min nap in the middle of the day, but it’s been months since I the last nap I’ve taken. I’ve also lost nearly 30lbs, which is nice. 

Google “Keto Diet” it’s the closest thing to what I’ve been up to. "
"Thank you SO much. 

I’ve read a few books on Adlerian psychology (undergrad psych major!) and I really enjoyed them. 

Everything will be okay... I know that. I just feel so tired from fighting my way to where I am now. Fighting my way through the depression... trying hard to be a better person and change my habits. Is so worth it but sometimes I just wish I could get a little break.... to turn off my thoughts and just not fight and just catch my breath and replenish for the rest of what’s ahead. The battle is worth it... I won’t give up... I’m just tired. 

Thank you so much for your response! "
"Well I've spoken with both provincial labour laws and federal, as the entity in question is a federal one. But with provincial I seem to have 3 complaints against then that I can file, and on federal I have at least 2 that complaints there.

"Well it depends on what type of therapy you are looking for. If you're looking for a therapist by your home, you can go to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists). If you're thinking about therapy online, I found [E-counseling.com](https://www.e-counseling.com/online-therapy/) through a quick Google search. I'm not sure which therapist to choose for you because every individual is different. So, I can't say if it will work. However, this is what shows up on Google. I have found that when all else fails, trust Google. It may not be the perfect fit but it's probably your best bet."
"As someone with schizophrenia, I was seen by more than 5 mental health professionals over 2 years before they determined it to be schizophrenia. Most scans of the head are to determine if there is brain damage which could be causing the symptoms, mine all came back fine, a scan is not used to diagnose schizophrenia, but to exclude other causes. I would say, pursue it with a different mental health practitioner and check with her that symptoms are not getting worse or there are not new ones. At a distance, I think the best thing you can do is help her document her symptoms and encourage her to keep seeing people until she has a diagnosis or at least something which helps her.

Her symptoms sound similar to mine prior to my diagnosis but I obviously don’t want to say it is schizophrenia, hence I encourage you to encourage her to keep trying to see people."
My situation is kind of similar to begin with i had bad friends who would hide from me when they see me reschedule literly anything to get out of hanging out with me and tell me to fuck of so they can talk to the cool people dads a drunk so iv had to put up with his bullshit for to long i dont like talking to mum after out of the 5 kids she has the one me is apparently responsible for her divorce. Recently iv moved out on my own and i met this beutiful girl who i thought liked me she would send me good morning texts and tell me her favorite flowers but then all of a sudden she basicly tells me she never wants to see me again. Todays my 23rd birthday and iv never had a girlfriend so im feeling rather pathetic and alone also in a new state so i dont know anyone and evertime i see people happy together i just want to destroy everything they have out of spite

"&gt;   I haven’t ever been told mental illness contraindicates having children. 

That is somewhat true.  The problem is that while there are over 300 diagnosable mental disorders ranging from the mild to complete psychosis, there are only a handful of hard, fast chemical tests for any of them.  Symptomology and family history are really all we have.

"
I disagree. I think a lot of people become attached to their therapists and it’s pretty normal. Was just talking about this with my therapist and she was saying it’s normal for me to see her as an attachment figure and her therapist would be one for her. While yes you need boundaries still to say don’t become attached to therapists seems incorrect.
"I get the same thoughts as you. I do talk to people who want to listen and know what I'm going through. Mainly I come on here to vent and it does work sometimes. Sometimes I just want to be a hermit and not talk to anyone.  If you do feel like you need to talk to someone, I know you dont know me, but you can always message me on here or I have Facebook. "
"I see everyone else as equal to me, if not above me because I know that I’m not a great person. And I would understand if someone else killed me because I feel the exact same way.

Nope. I just have so many mental health issues going on that I can't shut my brain down easily. It is not as bad as over the summer (I didn't sleep for 2 days at one point before I crashed) but still annoying. I don't like taking pills and the only one I take is my anti-anxiety pill Clonidine. It helps me sleep somewhat. Thanks for the suggestion though.
"Obviously. But so what? So you get the house a little later in life? And won’t it be better to get it when you’re happy and able to enjoy yourself?

Try to see what the VA has in your area. Tell your wife if and when your ready to. It's not uncommon at all to go to therapy as part of treatment for anxiety/depression so she might just see it at that. When the time comes to cross that bridge you'll have support in the form of a therapist who  could help explain these problems to her in a reassured way.
"You're welcome. I mean there are sleeping aids in the drug stores, but I would talk to an actual MD to see if there is something better or safer that he/she can prescribe. I don't mind taking a sleep aid if it is just one or two nights of restless sleep, but for someone with insomnia...that is a little harder to deal with and you need an MD. :)

Be well!"
"I have never read a person with  schizophrenia  talking this positively. You guys are hero. During my internship, I had to work with multiple clients with schizophrenia some of whom refused to take their medicine and it was not pleasant. I won't say that romance and love is not for you because it hurts when we tell our clients that they may not feel a range of emotions but the way you're accepting is heroic, really. But you can hang out with people of opposite gender, you might develop some interest. The effect of antipsychotic varies. But don't be lonely, give it a try without giving up on your medicine."
"I know the actual assessment report is complete and ready, because the assessing organisation gave it to me when I left. 

I understand that mistakes happen, but I guess my frustration is because the regular ER doctor got her notes in already, the IOP intake psych doctor put notes in, and the psych ER doctor saw me for about two minutes, but put nothing in. 

It seems wrong that she couldn't at least have someone send the actual report to my psychiatrist...since they're both in Kaiser...

I'm going to send a message to Kaiser, asking for follow-up. Maybe I can even get a message to the doctor who saw me. "
"You may have a serious GI issue. Make an appointment with your doctor or Gastroenterologist ASAP. I have gastroparesis which can cause the kind of vomiting you experience. It can cause nausea but if I vomit from it, there is often little warning from my body. There are probably many other conditions that can cause this as well.  Search for the physical answers and while your doing it, let them know about your anxiety. If you can, find a good therapist. Whether it is a health issue or anxiety related, a therapist can help you deal with all of the issues. Take care and I hope you can see a doctor this week!"
"For panicattack i use this:
5 things you can see
4 things you can touch
3 things you can hear
2 things you can smell
1 thing you can taste.

So you just need to stop and trying to get yourself back on track. Sometimes because your hypochondria this isn't the best method. Baecause then you start thinking too much your body, and then you can only hear your explosing heart, and taste blood (cancer it is.. i googled that) 

So maybe next time just stop and focus on wind, focus on your table, what material is it? How many rocks you see in front of you at street. Etc. This is actually therapymethod, and help with other problems too, also hypocondria. When your head is trying to spot cancer inside you, just stop and do this. Many times in a day, do it even you feel good. Practice this, and try to get yourself back on track, and living this moment. Hope this helps"
"Thanks for responding friend. :)

Those with autism are a bit different, but he’s definitely a character to say the least. I also know that those with autism have trouble with norms, but I thought that they also have heightened-senses of empathy, sort of like me? That’s what I heard, anyway.

He absolutely needs to grow! I’m glad you pointed that out. He needs to understand that while I don’t consider myself a pushover or doormat, I certainly have boundaries and aspects of myself that need to be respected.

I certainly either need him to help me out here and be respectful, or I should stop talking to him. You seem pretty knowledgeable. Those with OCD have intrusive thoughts relating to violence or sexuality.

So his comment:

&gt; I’m going to go kill someone! 

Definitely isn’t the best comment to bring solace to someone with anxiety issues.

"Accepting and romanticizing are very different I think. I take my mental illness as part of my identity because I can't get rid of it, (Cheap professionals are not good, Good professionals are unpayable.) so if it is here to stay... I gotta do *something*. Ever seen those people in wheelchairs who do tricks with it? They are not doing it because ""Weelschiars are cool, innit?"" but because they can never get rid of the thing, so they might as well try to accept it's there and try to do something with it.

The reason we accept mental illness, and this is my firmly held belief, is because around 80-90% of the population suffers from some form of mentall illness worldwide, be it depression, anxiety, self hatred whatever, and being mentally ill became the norm. It's just that a majority of people have no personalities beyond ""Fanatically conform to social norm!!!!"" and thus they hide the full extent better, but most of them Obviously ave a few cogs jammed. Like my mother. You could write a PhD dissertation about depression and self defeating personality disorder about her, but no ""She is no crazy!!!"" Not my ass. "
"There is a lot of work that goes into keeping you alive. Much of it happens passively for you - your body digests food that you give it, your cells keep your brain and your muscles working so you can think and move around, your heart and lungs keep working to help all of your cells. Your body can be your biggest supporter! The problem is that your body responds to gradual changes you make, so when you are downhill from where you want to be it can seem like there is a lot of work that you have to do ""against"" your body, and its response will also be gradual. You're not really fighting your physical body, just it's habits. That's hard, but not impossible.

If you are in that situation, don't do everything at once. Pick what seems most doable or interesting to you and do that. Try to do it for a few weeks if you can. After that, re-evaluate, and look at how doing that thing has impacted you - if it hasn't, try something else.

If you really feel like everything is too much work to be worth it, or that everything leads to despair, then seek counseling or psychiatric advice. I hope you find something that works."
"Well how powerful are the zaps? I wonder if this relief is due to the endorphins your body is releasing after the shock.  

I can totally relate to you, though. My senior year of college (only a year ago) I couldn’t complete the day let alone any assignments without smoking weed. I know it’s different, but now that I’m not in that state, I can see that I was telling myself I needed weed to function normally, when in fact, I was using weed to numb myself from the reality that I was really afraid of “functioning normally.” I know weed isn’t the same, but I also self harmed when I was younger. For the rest of the day, I always felt like I was in a dazed, dream-like state. I can only imagine this feeling was a result of my body crashing after the endorphin and Adrenalin roller coaster I had just put my it through. 

In comparison to cutting myself, I felt that smoking weed every day all day was a pretty adaptive coping mechanism. It took me a while to realize that even though I wasn’t causing a lot of damage, I was still using an unhealthy habit of smoking to prevent me from feeling the emotions that come with every day life. (And they aren’t always comfortable to feel).

I’m glad you’ve found some relief, really. I would consider maybe talking to someone though. An objective opinion can do wonders, and you might really enjoy your sessions!

"See now instead of acknowledging  anything that I said you just want to tell me basically to fuck off because of the last paragraph? So yeah, obviously you did not understand anything I wrote and somebody with more tact needs to come in and explain their perspective it prettier to you so you don’t feel preached to. “Rescue me”

I guess you’re just ignoring everything I wrote except the last paragraph about how I was frustrated about the tone and implications of your post. I wrote it to express how I felt about the implied accusation, it did not make me feel warm and fuzzy, but it did not make me your mortal enemy which is how you’re coming back at me. You haven’t even acknowledged anything I’ve said. I replied to explain, not only to you but others who might have the same thoughts. It’s not YOU, it’s the IDEAS. 

The rest of it was just answering your question the best I could. Also in your post you did have a certain “tone” of being offended. You implied things. Things that aren’t true. Please don’t try to act like your question was completely innocent and naive. 

I hope that you now understand better, I hope you can see it from another perspective. I’m sorry that you have been dismissed by people in the past, I have too. But I am not dismissing you, and if someone were to dismiss you I would absolutely take issue with that. 

I got defensive because...well you read the post. But also because I had JUST made a post 3 days ago asking for a group like this and when I saw that it had been created, I was like HIGH, happy, and then when I saw a comment with implied motives about superiority, I was LOW. It literally hurt. Honestly, it’s like you were dismissing ME. 

I don’t want to fight with you dude, it’s not worth it. Supposed to be a question about why people over 30 would want their own space. Not even about that any more.

"There's a difference between not being able to help, and shaming people for being suicidal. I can't blame those who are unable. We're not superhuman.

They say some antidepressants are safe when you are pregnant but I don’t believe that. Anything meant to alter brain chemistry will also alter brain chemistry in a developing brain. There are no longitudinal studies on the effects on your child. Unless you are severely mentally ill I would not recommend utilizing psychotropic medications while pregnant.

"Yeah I think I understand what you mean, for many depression becomes what they are used to to the point that it is difficult to imagine being happy again or try getting treatment. It’s a very normal thing with depression as once sadness becomes such a huge part of your life it is hard to see future without it if that makes sense. Is this what you mean? "
"You're too hard on yourself. You need to stop with the psychological self-attacking.

"Do not withhold information from your treating clinician.  If you don't trust them, find another and then leave them.

Edit: also a support group might be useful, depending on the possibility of slipping work performance due to your condition, you may need to weight going to HR about ""accommodations."" Or at least a chat with direct supervisor. In order to hedge against termination. "
"I would, of course, be willing to give that time if I have too.  I was considering it mostly because it would give him more access.  He has never had any of these outbursts at home, so I have never seen them.  They only happen at school. I have tried to work with the school, but they want to go the discipline route and think threatening suspending him will help deter when he is already losing control of himself.  The virual or online therapies I have seen offer text and chat with therapists and they respond several times a day.  He is always instantly calm when I arrive, but I can't keep leaving work to go to him, nor would that help him to progress.  He needs someone that he can call on that can help him recognise his triggers and work through them. I love him to admit that I am not the person most qualified for this and to try and find him the best fit.  "
"Many years ago (10+) I drove myself to the ER, explained that I was experiencing an intractable panic attack and did not know what to do. 

I was seen immediately, they ran a bunch of tests to rule out a cardiac event, and sent me up to psych where I visited with a very kind and patient doctor.  I remember nothing of our conversation, but he bought me a can of Pepsi from the vending machine and ordered a dose of Ativan then let me chill out in a private room with a TV (I remember watching CSI).  

After 20 minutes or so, I phoned a friend to pick me up and I was discharged with a very short-term prescription for Ativan that got me through until I was able to establish care with my current provider.

"Just knowing how unhygienic people can be is gross to me. And I’m like extremely grossed out by bodily fluids. It even goes beyond like physical things though. It freaks me out how we can never know what’s going on inside someone’s head. So that, paired with the physical things that gross me out, make me way less of a people person to say the least. "
Personality disorders are very difficult to treat. Imagine if someone told you there was something wrong with your personality and tried to change it... wouldn’t be easy. Especially if you didn’t see the problem. But a very good clinician with a lot of experience could possibly help. Assuming your husband was open to it which it seems like he isn’t.
"What exactly is the point of blaming people?

Every single person on this planet is doing the best they can to get by. Do you think parents who deny that a child is suicidal do so on purpose?

And do you think you could punish them any more than they are going to punish themselves?

Too much of mental illness is already about blaming, which solves nothing."
"at first when i was made to see a therapist i hated it and it made me worse because i wasn’t ready for it, but as time passed and i was healing slowly therapy was a very helpful tool for getting everything out in a safe and productive environment with someone who will only try to help you, i highly recommend it if it’s what you want and feel you need.

"Bravery isn't fearlessness.  Bravery is being scared and still doing what you need to do.

 Panic attacks suck, but you will always survive them.  Next time you have a panic attack going to work, just wait.  Tell yourself that it's only temporary and will pass in a few minutes then pace around or something for a few minutes.  You definitely need to keep your job if you can."
"thats the goal :) it helped me out a lot just to know that meant something to you. from what little i know of you i know youre profound, and even though theres a lot of superficial people out there, theres a lot of profound people too and they'll make it worth it.

"Focus on one thing at a time

You learn through failure, not through success, every failure is a lesson in the path to success.

When you are depressed and gloomy you aren't engaging, people react to that. Introduce yourself to people, get interested in what they are interested in and talk to them about what they like. At first that feels awkward as hell but it feels natural after a while.

Be the best version of who you are, ask yourself what type of person would you go out with.

If you are fat, do something about it, eat well, start lifting weights and while you are there talk to people.

If you have trouble with girls, ask them for advice. Talk to them, tease them, interact with them, women fall in love through their ears, not through their eyes. Ask older women for advice too.

And remember every failure is a lesson in the path to success.

"Hi friend! I think you should try and see a counselor or therapist ASAP. I’m sure your school could probably help with that as well. This sounds like a combination of burn out, depression, and maybe even anxiety regarding your future. Even if you could talk to your advisor and explain what has been going on, they might be able to help you get through exams and finish your program. 

You’ve been in school for a LONG time going 100 miles an hour without rest. Our bodies can only sustain that for so long. Not to mention, you’re so close to finishing you probably have a lot of fears about what’s next after school and what if you don’t succeed or what if you hate it or what if what if. That subconscious self doubt can creep up on us and take us out before we even realize it. 

Please reach out for some help. We can’t get through this life alone ❤️"
"my friend does the same kind of thing, except he bluntly says it and sometimes goes into detail, i’m not jealous or anything like that i just think it’s disgusting. like i see him as a brother i don’t want to hear about his sex life �� imo though i think it’s really immature to brag about sex, it’s a personal thing, to me it’s like talking about having a poo or something, it’s just not really a valid conversational piece now is it, maybe that’s just me though, i find sex extremely personal and would never talk about it to anyone but that’s just me. i told my friend it makes me really uncomfortable, and he played dumb saying “why i didn’t say anything that bad” and he still does it from time to time, i just ignore it now and don’t give it any acknowledgement because it just seems he’s doing it to brag so i don’t validate it. "
"Yeah, I understand the feeling of disproportionate anger. You know it's not really justified and yet you're completely consumed by it - shaking with rage, hurting yourself just to find a way to depressurise. It's an awful feeling. Try not to fight it. Acknowledge it and respect it, vocalise the reasons that you are angry and allow it to run its course. The less resistance you give it, the quicker it will pass.

When that's done, talk to your boyfriend and take things from there. Make sure you're in a better place when you do.

If you want to speed things up, I find 5-10 minutes of vigorous exercise can really help (running is best for me).

On the longer term, I would really recommend getting some professional treatment. All-consuming rage that makes you hurt yourself is a clear sign that something isn't right mentally. There's no shame in admitting that to yourself. It might help to admit it to your boyfriend as well. Talk to somebody and work out a treatment plan - this is something that you could one day be completely free of if you get the right help.

Hope you're feeling better by the time you read this."

"Ah, yes. Then unfortunately you are definitely correct that this will affect your career.

Try taking some benadryl- the usual groggy feeling is just enough to allow other coping skills to work.

"It will take a few weeks to kick in - you won't feel anything at first, most likely.

If you develop side effects, tell your doctor. That goes double if you start feeling more depressed and/or suicidal, which can be a side effect of antidepressants.

Good luck!"
"Meditation and learning how to sit with the thoughts and the discomfort it brings without judging yourself. It seems cliche, but that really helps me with ruminating thoughts and negative feelings. 

You can never really push what you feel out of the way. You instead need to sit with it and let it be. If you try to push it away, the more you'll think about."
"Sometimes music can help. Look for sad songs. Either some you that already know or search reddit for sad songs, there are a few long threads on reddit with lots of different songs.

"Upon reading this after seeing your newest post, a lot makes sense. I don't know how they became a licensed psychiatrist but you're dealing with an extreme narcissist.

"You're an amazing person who obviously is well qualified for the role. Everyone who will go and have a interview with them will feel similar to you and be nervous.

"there are online therapy companies who charge about $150-200/month for unlimited therapy by chat, phone or video. i think you are limited to 2 weekly phone or video sessions but that should be good enough. you can also text throughout the month. just google ""online therapy"" or ""best online therapy"" and there are sites that have reviews of all the companies."
"I basically can't stop ruminating. Constantly about the same thing every day. I am basically ruminating about what I am supposed to do when I ruminate. My therapist told me you can't stop thinking about something, and this has made my thoughts and rumination the worst they have ever been. None of the techniques I have been shown help my rumination, but in actually fact make it a lot worse. I actually ruminate about the techniques. These ruminating thoughts have been going on everyday for months. I'm at the point where I am getting suicidal thoughts, and where I think killing my self is the only way out this."
"I have been in and out of psychiatric hospitals all my life. They definitely helped when I was suicidal. I can't speak about sobriety because my alcoholism started after my hospitalization. I no longer wanted to kill myself outright, but I fell into dangerous addiction to alcohol instead. I kicked it by myself 2 years ago after a year of drinking heavily. I got the most out of group therapy and art therapy. We also did a lot of socializing (we had tons of free time) and we were able to listen to music and draw and talk. It was OK. Being away from my family was the part I had hated the most. Good luck to you."
"It took me nearly 30 years (I’m 32) to realize that I should not be concerned with what others say about me. I’m still working on it. 

When it comes to your worth/value, your opinion is more important than anyone else’s. Loving yourself is the most beautiful thing, and you deserve to experience it. 

People might say negative things about you for the following reasons: they’re in a bad mood that day/always, they are jealous about something you have, they misunderstood you, etc. Learn to be okay with their negative reactions, and decide if you should respond. Usually, it is their problem, not yours. "
"It's such a hard thing to describe. Frantic thoughts but the thoughts themselves were benign. I'm glad my description helped you a little. 
I'm just blown away by this... Hadn't even thought of it for a long time and now I'm telling my mom about it. She's sad that I was having this weird experience as a kid but admitted they probably would have thought I was making it up. 
You just gave me a puzzle piece that was missing for a really long time. And the Google groups posts are so familiar. It's just crazy that it's such a benign thing and yet I spent a good portion of my childhood thinking I was legit crazy. "
"There is some overlap / similarity between some different mental heath conditions.    CPTSD/PTSD  can be misdiagnosed as BP or other things.  Happened to me.  The various drugs I tried were beyond awful or did nothing.    

Problem with a lot of psychiatrists is that they think drugs are the answer to everything.  And a lot of therapists align themselves with or work in a group practice that has psychiatrists.    If your  MH issue is trauma caused,  no pill is going to cure your head.  Only therapy.  But drugs have worked for plenty of people with various mental illnesses.  Find another psychiatrist.  Peace."
"God is always there for you, and if you allow yourself to walk with him he can turn the most miserable existance into something beautiful. He alone gives purpose, and is the source of all love and meaning. Without him you will feel like this for infinite eternity. I spent the first 19 years of my life so utterly miserable because i didn't understand mental illness, that i was severely anxious, depressed, bipolar and having endured a childhood of abuse. I was raised in church and everyone said ""just trust God"" and ""obey him and he will give you joy"". Well i never understood, i thought it was God's punishment for me not following him right. Well I finally got out of that situation at home and struggled with my faith on my own. But lately I've applied myself to pray every day, just once, and I finally think I know that purpose and joy they were talking about. I've gone into detail on my blog, romanseight18.blogspot.com . if you'd want to check it out I hope it will reach people with encouragement and hope. I'll pray for you, i know life can be absolute shit but that doesn't mean you don't have a reason to be here"
"I get really sad as a part of my PMS, but it’s not quite as severe as yours (as in I’ve wanted to die and could think of nothing other than hurting myself, like intrusive images and such, but I didn’t go through with it.) 

Obviously, you should talk to your doctor about this and a therapist. It definitely sounds like a medical issue that can be fixed with medicine. 

In the mean time, my suggestion is to take advantage of your more stable state during the rest of the month. You said you were afraid that you’d go through with suicide during your next episode. It is GOOD that you’re afraid of this; it means you have a sense of hope and self preservation left. While you’re afraid, leave yourself a note or some sort of reminder how much you love your life and the people in it. When you have your next episode, reading that note might help keep you on this side of the edge. 

This isn’t a replacement for meds and therapy, just something to keep you safe in the meantime. 

I hope this helps, knowing that you’re not alone and that it is nothing to be ashamed of. Stay strong, and stay here ����"
"Hi there. My current approach to this is to get professional help for my mental health problems, including therapy so that I have somebody to talk to whose job it is to listen to people having problems like mine. This means that I don't have to depend on my friends to help me resolve my issues. It doesn't mean I can't talk to my friends about what I'm struggling with, it just means that I don't need and depend on them for it.

This subtle change in dynamic with my friends is really important for me - it helps to take away that feeling of being let down if they can't be there for me for whatever reason (other stuff happening in their lives, can't relate, too much to handle, etc.). I think that's pretty important as it means you stop seeing your friends as potential therapists and see them as just friends again, so you can have relationships with them where you can be there for each other.

This may not work for everyone and it's early days for me at the moment, but I think it's a healthy step for me.

Remember you can always talk to us, and there are plenty of people here (myself included) who would offer their time for you if you wanted to discuss things privately in direct messages, so don't be afraid to ask. If you want to share publicly here or message me directly, I'd encourage you to do that as it sounds like you could really do with opening up to someone."
"Anything really, most of the time it’s just one of them drunk complaining about how bad the other is. "

"Don't know your employment status, but some employers offer so many sessions for free with a therapist! "
For sure. Mental illness is so hard and it’s hitting people really hard in this “era”. It stinks.
"Hahaha no. But I can manage it better. It never totally goes away, and really depends on the situation. "
How do you know? You can only know if the results are skewed if it gets compared to an unbiased survey.
"I see. Thank you for that. Though talking is not really my talent nor favourite thing to do, I’ll try."
I think I have also been conditioned in some ways to view sleeping as indulgent and lazy to some extent.
"I use daylio to track mood n associated activities

Try bullet journalling if you’re the creative type"
I write down every kind thing others have done for me before I sleep. It really re frames my whole mood.
I'm very lucky to have a good psychiatrist and your bottom paragraph is my goal for now. Thank you :)
"Its THAT what these moments of 'great truth' are that I keep having?!

No it is not. Been tested for that. I have great hearing and no concerns in the actual ears for my age.

He doesn't respect anyone. Hes really selfish. We all know hes suicidal. He would probably attempt suicide if he were put in the hospital. He's wearing us all down bc hes such an asshole to us.

"I'm no mental health expert but I did a lot of psychedelics for a few years and I felt like I was loosing myself and getting more and more depressed and eventually I felt like I was going crazy. So I stopped and it was hard and did take a few months but I feel way better now, I know this sounds generic but it's all about doing a little better than yesterday."
Just slept with a guy I think. I know I drank too much and didn’t eat enough and knew exactly what I was doing but now my cat is gone and I broke a crystal wine glass and have a horrible headache. I do have a psychiatrist but I could not tell him this shit. What the fuck am I doing this again I can’t be drinking so heavily and on such heavy medications.
"Sounds like you hooked up with a fucking loser asshole douche canoe. You obviously cant change whats already happened so my wish for you is to learn from this and dont make similiar mistakes in the future. Dont allow this one thing to dictate your self worth.

"Yes! Right after I have a panic attack I start feeling extremely depressed, hypervigilant and anxious. Depending on the severity of the attack, these symptoms last for a few days up to a week. I think that understanding that this hightened level of anxiety is directly related to the panic attack makes it more bearable. I know that it will eventually subside."
"just be safe, and ask your doctor if sjw is gonna be potentially dangerous mixed with other stuff because unfortunately i'm not a professional i just have my personal experiences. when i had SJW with valerian, i was manic and it caused amnesia, i literally don't remember last year at all but i have zero memory issues since i stopped taking the herbal stuff. "
"I like to separate myself from the success I might or might not have in keeping a job. If I can't keep it and I get fired, then I have something to go to the doctor with. Look, it's so bad that I can't even keep a job. Please help, my case is at disability level. Personally, I wouldn't give up, tho I know this hurts. Make him fire you, and then don't take it personally. It's the illness that kept you, the illness that he's mad at, the illness that is making life so hard. Make the doc realize the effect of the illness by seeing through what it does to your life and documenting it. Idk, that's my advice anyway."
"I might have a mild form of it but I also think that what I have is more complex. It's not that one third of the time I feel dissociative, it's that the rest of the time I'm just coasting through life on autopilot. I have great memory and the decisions I make in ""autopilot"" are the same I'd make when fully cognisant and present. I can force myself to be fully present but it's mentally exhausting and I can't keep it up for longer than a few minutes. 

I also feel like it's the part of my brain I use for math. It's very mentally exhausting for me to try to learn math. And there are other symptoms to when I try."
"No I get that I do. For me, apathy is kind of a defense mechanism. I’m not totally apathetic but around my family I am. But that’s just because I’ve battled a lot with them and grown a resentment towards them. So interacting with them and showing emotions can be painful but I realize it only causes more resentment between us lol. Maybe trying to get to the root cause of why you feel this apathy can help? Like it’s a defense mechanism of some sort because of some past trauma that you need to heal from. I don’t know if you see a therapist but maybe you can see one to dive deeper into that if you want."
"There have been times and places in my life in which it was really difficult to find anyone nearby who was compatible as a friend. When I was younger, I assumed that it was my fault, but looking back at age 63, I can see that it was mostly luck and circumstance. What has worked for me is building a life, doing the things I enjoy and getting involved in some activities, saying Yes to things and people who took me a bit outside my comfort zone (in a safe, constructive way). Friendships do come along, but it takes awhile. Find whatever anchors you can and hold on, and be kind to yourself. Hugs and best wishes :)"
"You asked the same thing of another poster so surely you will have no problem sending me your credentials. Unless you're lying? 

Why did you say that someone was not a counselor and ask for their credentials if you are doing the same thing and cannot provide proof?

The other poster mentioned they had a flair of some sort given to them by mods as proof they were a counselor and you rejected this as solid evidence. Why would I trust your comments as ""proof"" if you would reject something like flair as proof?

Don't make claims you can't prove :) Lying on the internet doesn't make you a more successful person. "
"
I recommend experimenting with different techniques until you find one you think might work for you. “Mindfulness” is such a vague term, the trick is to find practices that work for you. 

I thought it was BS when my therapist had me employing various mindfulness coping techniques (this was about 4 years ago). I kept practicing though, and eventually I felt a noticeable difference in my anxiety/dissociation when employing the techniques.  I also started meditating about two years ago, and I noticed the benefits of mindfulness creeping into my everyday life. 

On a side note, I am incredibly thankful to that therapist for encouraging me to employ these techniques, even when I thought they were useless. I truly feel that she lead me to finding a healthier and happier way of seeing the world. 

TLDR - I thought mindfulness was useless BS, but I was wrong :) "
"I get them as well. I often wake up in the night in the middle of a nightmare and if I manage to fall asleep again, fall right back into the same nightmare. The intensity of them also comes and goes for me, but at this point I’ve had nightmares for so long (10+ years... I’m 23) that I don’t know what it’s like to not have nightmares or even just to have normal dreams. When my anxiety is up, I also feel afraid to fall asleep and lay awake wondering if staying awake with my paranoia or falling asleep with my nightmares is worse. 

I have no solution. I have tried meditations and breathing exercises, ASMR videos, exercise, medications, etc. The only thing that seems to somewhat work is making myself so exhausted that I fall asleep soundly, which isn’t very often. Sorry, I don’t mean to be a downer... I just want to let you know that you are not alone."
"You might want to start taking a light anti psychotic. The good news is you haven't had your complete psychotic break yet, and if you start treatment now there might be a chance you don't have to stay on antipsychotics for the rest of your life. Plus they might help your depression. There's going to be a trial period for you to find the right medicine, stick to it. 

Hallucinations don't just happen without cause. I started having auditory hallucinations when I was in college, 2 years no treatment later, visual hallucinations for about a week. Then all hell broke loose. Constant, I mean constant, hallucinations for 48 days straight. Bugs all over me, hallucinating people screaming in my ears for hours, shit grabbing you and yelling at you if you try to sleep. I almost died. 

If you're doing drugs stop. This can get better, or it can get a hell of a lot worse."
"I tried to use betterhelp for a few months, to discuss some anxiety and relationship issues I was having.  At first I was worried because my therapist I was matched with seemed very accusatory and like he was blaming me for all my mental health problems.  And it’s like, yeah, I know it’s all in my head, that’s why I’m asking for help.  Isn’t it your job to help me get out of my own problems?

Eventually, I tried to reschedule a session because some last minute plans to hang out with friends came up, and my therapist on betterhelp told me I’d be better off quitting therapy altogether if I wanted to miss one session. Something about “not having my priority’s straight”.  To be honest, it was more than I didn’t want my mental health to be the reason that I bailed on friends yet again and wound up sitting at home alone another night.

Needless to say, I quit using betterhelp.  And now I see those ads on reddit all the time and it makes me want to punch the screen. My experience with it was shitty and a huge waste of money.  Maybe stop advertising it to me... I’m clearly not interested.

Sigh..."
"In my complete opinion (which is most-likely rubbish) I think yes... and no. I believe at the very beginning of it, some of us can choose to navigate ourselves out of the downward spiral but typically, at least from my little experience, in the beginning it starts with letting our circumstances get the best of us, blaming ourselves and others, then questioning and quite possible creating what the \*\*\*\* is wrong with us. I personally made myself depressed... so I  think  by ruminating on my problems, blaming myself, holding myself victim to circumstance and cat the beginning could actually feel the line between contempt and misery but I felt I deserved the misery so guess which way I went? Now I've slipped into it and the path that got me here is so hard to navigate back to its origin that I feel it's embedded in my subconscious mind and now I believe it is truly depression accompanied by it's lovely friend ""Anxiety"". It could very well be our own fault but don't dwell on that. Our fault or not there are ways of coping better and leading a more positive lifestyle and coming out of this battle the best we can."
"It ebbs and flows as you get older.  I think if it's hormone related it'll lighten as you age, and if you're mindful and continue to objectively learn about yourself you can understand your condition more as you age. 

If you don't have the mental capacity to study yourself and how you are and learn to understand yourself and your needs - you'll continue to decline in the process of aging.  

.....

Also for grad school,  can you lighten your load sighting medical issues?  Mental issues should be taken seriously.  I would also consider seeing your local doctor or psychiatrist to possibly get some medication to reduce your anxiety so you can focus better.  If you were less stressed overall I'm sure grad school wouldn't be as upsetting. :) 

I think a lot of people with anxiety have fears like these,  are concerned about losing family, and for some its paralyzing.  

I hope you feel better soon,  I know this amount of stress can be debilitating.  You really have got this handled either way,  trust yourself,  your body,  and get some rest,  talk to your family about how you're feeling.  You'll be in my thoughts :)"
"Two things I'll say

1. Just keeping appeareances isn't dealing with the problem, you need to go to therapy. It helps, they help me untie all the knots and she goes ""woah woah woah"" when I'm stupidly overthinking stuff and she gets me right down to Earth again and makes me feel better, making sense of my thoughts and putting them in order. Btw I'm in the midwest too, hi!
2. An ESA isn't the same as a Therapy Animal. Do you want a pet? That's what an ESA is. They're not trained for anything, it just means that their presence helps you, so they have SOME accomodations such as no-pet buildings having to accept you (within reasonable terms) and not charge you fees, and same with stuff like airlines. But that's about it. If you were trying to go to work with a dog being an ESA won't qualify. So having that said, if you just want a companion go to the nearest shelter and get one, cause an ESA is basically a pet with A FEW extra rights.
3. CAN and WILL you take care of a pet? Just a reminder they're not toys and they will need you to be responsible, caring, loving, even when you don't feel like it, might make you spend money, break things. I'm a big animal lover, by no means I want to offend I just want to make sure that if you go get an animal make sure you will give him a good life too!

Ok it was three things--

I don't think it's cheating the system or anything like that. But I mean you might go to your first appointment and realize you don't necessarily NEED an ESA, you will start talking about other stuff, who knows. So ask yourself really what do you expect from your ESA, why do you think you need one, company? To get distracted by taking care of them?

But there's nothing wrong in asking. You wanna talk about weird? I'm trying to figure out how to tell my psychiatrist I'd like to try medical MJ for when my pills can't handle my anxiety, without getting judged lol"
"First, you need to know off-the-bat that what you're describing isn't your own personal weakness or anything like that. These companies are dedicated to ingraining this behaviour into you. I think they call it habit-forming, or something similar? But it's just a sugarcoated name for technology dedicated to getting you to be dependent on it. It relies on the same neural system as addiction, although it's not as severe as a physical addiction. It's a dependency, also called a psychological addiction, and breaking these patterns of behaviour is difficult. It's definitely something you are capable of, but it's designed to be difficult.

Second - well, I'll start off by saying that I struggled with the same thing. Except I would stay on Facebook exclusively. Regardless, what helped me was mindfulness. That might sound like it's out of nowhere, but daily mindfulness practices helped me realise and *actually feel* the desperation in my brain (the organ, not the mind) when I wasn't getting the dopamine hit that social media would give me. Realising the physical process that was going on inside me was half the battle.

The next bit was to do some reflective thinking. I've dealt with mental illness my whole life but haven't had a (decent) therapist until very recently. When I felt that impulse to reach for my dopamine-hit instrument (in this case, my phone) I would instead take a second to sit back and think about how I felt. Was I actually hungry or had some other need that needed fulfilling, but I was using the trance of the infinite scroll to ignore it? Was I feeling lonely or worthless? Perhaps I was trying to escape from some difficult emotions? Often there were a bunch of different reasons that I was relying on my phone to feel ""okay"", and once I actually addressed the problem it was easier to detach myself. It's something I had to do over and over again. To be honest I'm still not totally over it, but cutting social media entirely would mean cutting off contact with a lot of people who mean the world to me, so I'm still kind of stuck. However, it is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I don't get anxiety if I don't go on facebook anymore - in fact I barely go on facebook. I can wake up in the morning and not look at my phone for a few hours and feel totally fine. My productivity got a lot better as a result.

It's a process, but you will get there. If you're seeing a therapist, please don't hesitate to reach out to them for help. Just because the DSM doesn't talk about it, it doesn't mean that it isn't genuinely impactful on your wellbeing or something your therapist can't help you with. I hope things go well for you."
Alright. Thanks for listening by the way. I usually don't have anybody to talk to about this kinda stuff.
"And what does ""able to"" mean? You do it and....? You feel something? You enjoy it? Or how is it for you? "

Aye thanks mate. I may talk to my folks about going back to therapist but Idk how to go about doing that.

Do you think it's worth a try for my panic and PTSD? I heard it makes smart people dumb when they do ect
"I agree with this. I’ve been on 200mg, with no symptoms., there are no affects from such a small dose. "

Never get off or reduce your medication without the guidance and instruction from your a medical doctor.

Omg I tried to reply to this and type out my story and I sent it to someone else now it won't copy/paste
Omg yeah dealing with health insurance is a bitch and half ��. Hopefully it will get better one day.
Sometimes I feel like I’m internally fighting another me in my mind whenever I have to make a decision.
Thank you so much.  This is extremely helpful.  I still feel frozen but I think I know what I have to do.
"That is reassuring, thank you.

If anyone else has dealt with this I'd love to hear about the experience."
This hit hard. I feel the exact same way and it is this very mindset that ruins my relations with people.
We have the same situations too. I haven't much motivation to leave house and go along with other people.
"Yeah I can’t fall asleep ANYWHERE. Even if I’m really tired. It will takes lots of practice , tanks !"
"Yes, the CBD should benefit the anxiety which could be the crippling factor at the center of many issues."
[Trichotillomania](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/trichotillomania) is actually quite common.

"After my nightly shower, I burn an incense, light a candle, put on some calming essential oils, and write in my “one minute gratitude journal” (Amazon $6- or make ur own so easy.) then I meditate with Headspace for 10-15 min. Calms me right down and puts me ready for sleep. Plus, recognizing what you’re grateful for really puts a lot in perspective. :) "
"First, get more sleep. I usually dissociate when I'm functioning on no sleep. Secondly, detachment is more common that one might think. Albert Camus' The Stranger gives good insight on the phenomenon. It started happening to me in high school but now as I understand it more and know it's just your body's response to anxiety, I'm much better. You will be too. "
"Headspace (meditation app) has a pack specifically for anxiety which really helped me.

My morning run is the most effective thing for me though - wake up early and go running, it sets the day up in the right way and gives your body a shock, but a positive one, which changes the tone of any anxiety you might feel later in the day.

Good luck with your finals!"
"Hey I'm sorry I didn't mean to cause serious concern, what I meant was that since I won't choose to commit suicide, that the potential for an out by overdose is actually kind of appealing. I have actually found that my drug use has shifted my focus away from suicidal thoughts and I'm not in any danger of making that decision in the near future.

"I haven't decided and I don't want to decide to ever but I think ""I want to die"" ""I want to kill my self"" ""I should crash my car into a tree so I die"" like every day.  And I don't want it to get worse bc if it does I'm afraid I might actually do that.  And what if I hurt someone?  What if  in doing that someone else gets hurt?  What about my family, my dog?  "
I know the feeling trust me. It’s like you see Red and just go off and can’t help it. It sucks and I’m a really independent type of person who’s not much for telling others my problems let alone strangers but maybe talking to someone can help. I’m trying to do that now myself and it’s hard af to do but I know it’s necessary to try and get better
"I'm also in the UK, absolutely sucks. I thought about trying to get money up to go private but apparently you still have to go on NHS waiting lists so what's the bloody point  in that. Also if you get a diagnosis of anything, you still have to get a diagnosis from a NHS doctor before you can be referred for any relevant services. And waiting lists are YEARS. "
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm no expert in mental health (I only suffer from it sadly) but all I can say is for you to keep being you and support and stand by your brother. Your support &amp; patience with him is invaluable and shows just how nice of a person you are. I will say that if it does become overbearing for you to never hesitate to reach out for help.
"It could be a really big thing you are taking on, trying to help someone with depression. Depends on the depression, but if it's severe you may not be aware of what you are getting yourself into.

Good luck to both of you"
"Not sure why they down-voted you. Mild Aspergers could cause one to miss social cues. Does he have fixation tendencies or highly talented in any one area? 

Narcissism also can miss social cues from research I’ve read. 

It’s not your job to Dx him though. It’s your job to protect your own mental and physical health.  Please take care of yourself ❤️"
"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can affect anyone who’s experienced or witnessed anything traumatic (everyone’s definition of traumatic is different). Maybe you can suggest they talk to a therapist. If that’s not an option, meditation has been shown to be helpful :) You can PM me about it if you’d like, I’ve got some personal experience I can share. "
"Psychological abuse is often unintentional.

The family dynamic you mentioned is exactly what I was in. For years I was in an abuse situation. It was mostly just me that dealt with it. Only years later did others recognize what was going on.

It makes it much more difficult to deal with, to be sure, but doesn't change the reality of what you are experiencing."
"Sounds like unrealistic expectations coupled with a lovemap that is a little messed up.

Women want a well rounded man, who has hobbies and interests and who also takes care of them.

You need to pace the relationship, and drop the big expectations, you are there to connect and to enjoy each others company, think 1 year, 2 year timeframes, building up slowly."
"This is the only thing I have taken for anything mental health related.. I just finished antibiotics but I’m not sure if that would affect it. It’s day 1 and I feel ready to give up already!

"Would you prefer to have never known about your husband’s affair? If you could go back in time do you wish you had never found out about any of this?  

Anyways it’s also possible to forgive someone and leave them, forgiveness is for the person doing the forgiving as it allows you to move on. Forgiveness doesn’t necessarily mean staying in the marriage."
"You are whatever you put out onto the universe. If you have shit energy and always pessimistic, that’s exactly what you’ll attract. 

I honestly think you should focus on yourself, perhaps therapy. The right people will eventually come a long. Yeah sure company from others is nice, but at the end of the day we only have ourselves. Take care of you first. "
"You did nothing wrong. In fact, you went the extra mile and reported it. You are a good person. I know me saying it won't make you believe it but it is true. Maybe consider talking to a professional about what happened. They can help you process it and give you coping mechanisms to deal with the intrusive thoughts. I'm sorry you have to go through this ��"
"You’re not insane; delusions are more common than you’d think. I’d still recommend getting help, though. But I have good news: you seem to be self-aware and conflicted about your delusions. This is a good sign, it means you’ll probably have an easier time with treatment than someone who isn’t aware that they’re delusional. Good luck and God bless!"
"Hey! It's okay. Normally it take repeated offenses, but you should not worry about it. This is not your fault, and sometimes this stuff happens. I have gone through similar situations so I know what it feels like. I am sending you all the mental hugs in the world. 

(If your in the US) All you have to do is call your health insurance and tell them you need a new doctor. They will give you one. I know it's scary to get a new doctor, but it sounds like you need someone who cares and really understands that it's a rough process. I am wish you all the luck OP. I think you will find the right doctor for you. &lt;3 "
"I found the best way to redirect a thirst for alcohol is the Occupy all the other senses. Seriously, I can smell certain types of alcohol across the room. These things just drive me crazy.  I know you are on a bench right now, or maybe you started walking.  Grab anything and start smelling it. I am so sorry, but your allergies have to take the back seat to this.  Flowers are a bad choice.  someone's old socks that have been thrown out for a week are perfect.  I was once in a bar and completely stopped drinking after someone vomited right next to me.  Find the triggers that will make you take over your brain.  "
"It sounds like you understand the situation well, and I'd say clearly set out your boundaries. Don't be afraid of being angry or upset. You have every right to feel that way, and he should be accordingly respectful. Rarely do people who say they are going to commit suicide actually do it, they are way out of order. It sounds like you're being used to make them feel better. If/when they show up again make sure you're clear and cut off communication, it does sound like you're being manipulated and I wouldn't spare and more sympathy on them, feeling crappy will come with the territory. But be strong it will pass."
"Lexapro and other SSRIs do have downsides, but it’s primarily just possible side effects which are benign. If you get side effects from one, there are about a dozen others to try, all which affect different brains differently. You mentioned dependence and that’s an interesting topic. SSRIs don’t cause the typical type of “dependence” that you’d associate with other drugs, mainly because the effect is more after time than immediate. Some of them can have withdrawals, but it’s nothing compared to those that alcohol and even weed can bring about. Especially at a low dose, it’s worth trying out IMO"
"Oh sweetheart. My heart broke for you. I just want to hold you in my arms and comfort you right now. :'( Please know that if you ever need to talk, I am always available.   
And awesome on the bench pressing! I am a female, less than 5 foot tall and I was about 130-ish at the time, and I could press at least 100 lbs. :) I used to do karate (Tung Soo Doo-I was a green belt) and I was in gymnastics for most of my early childhood. I am impressed.   


The offer stands though. If you need to chat, just hit me up. I am not that much younger than yourself. I am almost 48. :) Take care and lots of love sent your way."
"I am in Pa also, and our 2 sons are in a sort of treatment for their High Functioning Autsim. They both can decide if they want to continue seeing the mobile therapist and the psychologist since they are now 16 and 14. They can sign the encounter papers themselves. Our other boy is only 8, so we have to still sign for him. I actually find this OP very offensive. Bullshit the benefits don't outweigh the drawbacks. I am on SSDI (Disability) and I would have NEVER gotten it without the diagnoses that I have. It helps us financially because I can't work. Period. Nobody is going to hire a pyromaniac anyway. Heh. My sons get SSI and it helps out. They can get therapy for no cost and help in school when they need it. So stop talking out your ass. The diagnosis (es) aren't what defines a person, but damn if it doesn't help when they want to get help for their problems."
"I was always this same exact way. I held onto everything because of sentimental reasons. A few months ago I had to move into a much smaller place than before and I had to decide what to do with all my stuff. I ended up throwing out so many things I never thought I’d ever get rid of. It felt freeing to me and like I was no longer stuck in the past so much. I didn’t realize how good it would feel to let go of some of it. But I don’t know if everyone is like that, but I get it. If your stuff is overwhelming though, just try to get rid of a little at a time, starting with items you think you can probably live without. I just told myself that I’ve been holding onto love letters from when I was 12 years old and I never once looked at them again, so why keep them? So if it’s something you never look at or use, you likely won’t miss it. You know? Good luck "
"They do legitimately work for some people. I don’t mean to say they don’t work at all. I’m just saying that the science that’s been used to support them is proving to be wrong. Just like gravity still works even though it was poorly understood for a long time and certain associations were made with it that later proved to be wrong. SSRIs can still be a part of a treatment plan, but they’re not the right fit for everyone and the contemporary research gives some reasons why they’re not universally effective. 

You maybe could try some other things. Maybe a different SSRI would have a positive effect. Maybe you need a completely different type of medication. Maybe none of the current common meds will work for you. None of the meds I’ve tried so far, across multiple classes, have had a positive effect on me. They’ve either been neutral or negative. "
"I don’t know of any virtual therapy, specifically, but I have a few thoughts. 

Have you talked to his guidance counselor about this? They may be able to provide him with some help during school time, at his school. They may also know of other professionals the district has that may be of use to your son, again, during school time. Since they know your son, they may be able to suggest the best out-of-school therapist in your area. (I know that’s not what you want, but hear me out.)

You say you have the time between school and bed with him, but you don’t want to give that up. What if therapy could help him be immensely happier and more successful in school and all parts of his life? Therapy is only one hour a week at most. You would still have all that other time with him. As a mother, sometimes it’s your job to put his needs above yours. This isn’t meant as a judgement of you (in fact it’s a credit to you that you cherish your time with him so dearly) but something to think about. Could you give up an hour a week of your time with him in exchange for him being happier, healthier and more successful?"
"Oh my gosh thank you posting this! You sound like a good person. 

 When I was in the ER for being suicidal all the guards did was put me in restraints in the bed. I was lying there for so many hours all alone, scared and with no medical attention for a long time. I'd never been restrained before for any reason so it was very distressing. 

It would have been nice if someone had come over and just talked to me. Said they were sorry I was hurting. Or glad I was there because the staff would (eventually) help me. Maybe ask questions about my life. Like what is it favorite food or music, distracting things. 

At the time I was restrained I believed the guards &amp; ER staff were actually harming me not helping me. Because being alive was worse than dying, in my mind at that time. 

 I developed a shorter version of PTSD and was terrified of all officers for months afterwards. 

I believe that could have been offset if someone had just talked to me, acknowledged my pain and fear and offered a few words of comfort. When someone is hurting that much small gestures of kindness have a bigger impact than you could ever know. 

I'm doing much better with my depression now and want to be a police officer because I think my experience would be valuable in the force, assuming I maintain good health. Thank you for asking this, I wish other people could have such a kind heart. "
"Its a good question.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, the process is, being aware of the fact that I am feeling something (an emotion), then figuring out what it is, *and doing something about it.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned awhile ago that a lot of people with abuse issues get really good a suppressing or shutting down their feelings, neglecting them, not acting to resolve them, not respecting them.  Either that, or just *reacting* and doing things that are damaging to themselves, like substances, overeating, self harm etc. This was definitely me up until fairly recently. I didnt even know that was a bad pattern, that was doing harm to me and the people around me. My usual pattern of (dys) functioning was to ignore feelings , let them build up, and then explode on anything that gave me an excuse to get mad, or go and act out in ways that caused me harm.

&amp;#x200B;

Not good.

&amp;#x200B;

So now the work for me is to  (1) acknowledge there's a feeling. (2) Pay attention to it, and (3) try and figure out what the cause of it was, and (4) identify it, so I know what it is. (Another thing abuse survivors can be crappy at is discerning what different feelings are, and what they mean. For most of my life the only two feelings I have properly known have been 'happy' and 'sad'. Clearly if you go through life only having this repertoire, your inner life will be pretty impoverished. For me, it certainly was.

&amp;#x200B;

If the cause is something I can do something about; something someone said or did, a situation thats bugging me, a physical issue, or whatever; then (5) I try to address it responsibly and in an adult way so that it doesnt start to build up and get me out of control. This means valuing myself, respecting my own right to have feelings, and then dealing with them as an adult. I have found doing this has improved my quality of life a great deal.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're a person who learned you werent worth much and your feelings didnt matter, these patterns can be lifelong, but they dont have to be. The work is to understand whats going wrong with how you do feelings, and then to start to respond differently. IMO."
"@BlueGreenandPink - Thank you for sharing your story.  I'm rooting for you and I hope you follow through with your passion to pursue your dream job! 

If you're covering all of your own expenses except for rent, is it really hurting your parents to cover your part of the rent?  If you are excessively using electricity, water, and gas, then I may see where they are coming from.  You mentioned that you go to therapy every week and exercise 3-5 times a week; it looks like you do your best to be active outside of the house while taking care of your health, rather than using up all of the utilities at your parents' home. 

It's really awesome that you haven't given up, since you mentioned your grades started as average but you achieved a 4.0 GPA in the upper division courses.  There seems to be more pressure for people in our age range (31/F here) to ""still be in school"".  I don't know if you have academic competition in your family, but my brother (27/M - part time job / part time school) definitely gets a lot of shit for being in community college and our relatives keep poking at the fact that our younger cousins will be graduating before him.  Fuck those toxic people, we should be encouraging each other and lifting each other up. 

By the way, I came across your post because I've just decided I want to go back to school and pursue a PsyD as well!  I've gotten my Bachelor's degree in 2009 in Communication, worked in a variety of marketing jobs, and realized I'm not being fulfilled with what I do.  My community college grades were good, but my cumulative GPA at graduation was 2.98 :(.  However, I had just gotten diagnosed with ADHD last year and now it all makes sense to me why I didn't do as well as I thought I could from high school through college.  I recently started medication for my ADHD and may have gotten the confidence to try my hand again in higher education, now that I've had some time think about what I want and effectively research the steps to reach my goals. I actually wanted to study psychology during my undergrad, but my whole big family discouraged me from it, assuming that it will not help in the job market and drove me to do what they thought was best for me.  I may have to write my own post to elaborate on my background, how I feel, and the rest of this story.  

But I found your expression here very inspiring.  I hope this helps you and good luck!  "

"i know this feeling my one year will be on December the 30th, you're doing so well, im proud of you ❤️"

thanks for the appreciation"
"Can't wait to write a post about you asking why you think you can get away with being abusive because I hurt your delicate feelings. 
Let me guess, you're a gun-toting white nationalist who doesn't trust the government and let his paranoia and insecurities permeate every aspect of his life and now you feel justified in being hurt that someone stood up to you. "
"Depending on what state you live in, there may be options to seek treatment without your father’s consent. This is a question you should be asking your current provider as well as the provider she referred you to. 

I’m assuming it’s a matter of consent and not just an inability or reluctance or your part to make a phone call to schedule an appointment. "
"Honestly sounds like depression and anxiety. I am no doctor however but these are very common symptoms, you should encourage him to see a doctor or psychiatrist just to be sure. 

For Depression and Anxiety, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)is the best way to go. My dad and brother went through this when their depression came up and it helped them immensely. "
"I would say that you are getting too activated on Zoloft, and I would also suspect that your sleep paralysis is a result of sleep apnoea which increases glutamate which would cause an even more intense reaction to Zoloft. One of the major signs of sleep apnoea is depression, anxiety and tiredness (Just like MDD). I would get a sleep study done just to be sure."
"Not to make you feel like an oddball, or outcast, it's just that you should be able to take what people say and brush it off, not want to bash their head in. Obviously there is a lack of context, and I'm not getting the full story but, most people I assume would maybe hold a grudge not want to kill the person that's verbally attacking them, in most instances. "
"Oh, I can send you proof of my title, absolutely. I'm just not willing to give my managers access to my post history, because I'm petty and it's depressing.

So we've established that I know more than you about this subject, yes? Would you like to listen now or keep wailing?"
"Read [The Relaxation Response](https://www.amazon.com/Relaxation-Response-Herbert-Benson/dp/0380815958/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537804199&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=relaxation+response&amp;dpID=51HHFmDOe7L&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch).

"She could have both, who knows, she refuses to get tested, and since the MRI and the CT Scan she had showed nothing, she thinks she's perfectly fine, yet she's never been to a specialist afterwards to discuss her symptoms.  

  
Those types of tests are not a determined way to diagnose someone.  It's been a controversy in the medical field for quite some time."
"Tried therapy it failed. I don’t have time to try again, I don’t have time to take care of myself. 
I would rather not deal with life, its to much effort for the outcome. 

The point is we are following rules that have no purpose. We have rules and humanity survives slightly longer, regardless humanity will go extinct and all of our lives are for nothing. "
"Yes. Stress/anxiety over finances is one of my biggest triggers. Unfortunately, that won't ease until Feb. when I am expecting a huge settlement on top of our tax refund. Things will get better for us. Just counting down the months basically. :) I know relief is in sight, and I am SO looking forward to remodeling the kitchen. :D I am super excited about that. "
"I am so sorry. I was in the exact same situation as you a few years back. My dad got me a kitten to help with my depression and newly diagnosed personality disorder and one day he just collapsed on me. I was told by the vets that he wouldn't make it and sometimes kittens just pass away. It's called Fading Kitten Syndrome and there's nothing you can do about it. You did nothing wrong. Sometimes these things just happen and the fact that he died loved by you is more than you could have ever done. Albeit his life was short, he experienced something that not many people do and that still means he had a good one ❤"
"No, YOU are the reason you have anger issues. Until you can fully accept responsibility for your behavior and not shift the blame to someone else, you have little hope of recovery. 

And here’s a thought: How about you remove YOURSELF from the situation where you a danger to your daughter and potentially your wife instead of whining about how CPS might take your daughter away from you (as well they should if they ever find out the extent of your last little tantrum).   Remove yourself from your home and enroll yourself in an intensive in or outpatient therapy program before you seriously injure someone else. "
"Thanks but the prognosis for this disorder in adults is pretty shit. I can learn to control my compulsions better (I sort of HAVE to keep control) and learn what triggers my disorder, but being ""cured"" of it won't happen, according to the Psychologist. :( It is a very destructive disorder if it gets out of control and can cost a ton of damage to property and even loss of life. I have an advantage younger people might not have: I have self-control from years of controlling my other Impuse Control issues.

Thanks man. I appreciate the message back. I am really struggling today after having an easy day yesterday. "
"That reinforces to me that what you're dealing with is intrusive thoughts rather than a desire to harm others/animals.  You're not 12 anymore, you have impulse control and a developed sense of right and wrong - evidenced by the fact that you haven't behaved violently for 20 years. 

I hope that you can find a way to forgive yourself. Even though you're not acting on them, these obsessive/intrusive thoughts are obviously still causing you a lot of suffering, and really negatively affecting your quality of life. How can an emotionally immature 12 year old child be expected to deal with that without acting out? 

"
"This is what plagues me too. I was hoping for a little leniency when it came to absences at school, but the disability office did literally nothing for me. I could have 10 extra minutes on tests (which I didn't need) or I could have nothing. Being crammed into a hot room (with tiny desks that I barely fit into because I'm tall) with 40 other people and getting frustrated with teachers who don't feel like actually teaching, is just too much for my anxiety and panic disorder sometimes. I've tried to go back to school 4 or 5 times, and I can never do more than a single semester because my panic attacks are too disruptive. Every time I get close to having enough credits to graduate, the school changes the graduation requirements.

I'm almost 35 and I can't hold down a job I'm qualified for, which is basically just retail, and I feel like a shitty failure constantly."
"I’m seeing a lot of advice about how to help your son, which is great! My advice is about his girlfriend. Talk to her, and make sure she knows that she doesn’t have to stay with him if she doesn’t want to, and that his actions are his own. Make sure she knows that if she still wants to end the relationship, you are supportive of that, and you don’t blame her. As a girl whose ex used to pull the “ill kill myself if you leave” threat, it’s absolutely terrifying to feel like you’re singlehandedly responsible for someone’s life. Your son is obviously struggling and very sick, but it should not fall on a teenaged girl to fix him. She can’t, only professionals can- and it sounds like staying with him is probably not very good for her, emotionally. Make sure your son knows that you want him to be safe and happy, but also that it’s unfair and abusive to manipulate people with threats of suicide, and that if someone wants to end things with you, they have that right. I’m very sorry for what your family is going through, I can imagine that this is an incredibly difficult time for everyone involved. "
"Yes, omg yes. Lolita romanticizes/ normalizes pedophilia,  Beauty and the Beast romanticizes/ normalizes Stockholm Sydrome, abuse, narcissism, Dexter romanticizes/ normalizes/ justifies murder and psychopathy...

There are so many systemic issues that can be traced back to how they are represented in society. Inherent mysogyny allows mental illness to be expected in some people as a strength or a weakness. Women who are narcissists are evil, but men who are narcissists can make decisions for the country. Men who are depressed can be abusive husbands because they are brilliant artists and they struggle with their mind, but women who are depressed had their inevitable suicide coming because sex and drugs, ""Omg they hurt so many people! It's so sad!""

Men who commit suicide win awards, women who commit suicide get sexualized.

As individuals in society, we internalize these standards and apply them to our own analysis of ourselves. It isn't a mistake that artists could get away with having perceived disorders in Psychology. It was a pass, especially for men to not have to adhere to social norms (as long as it wasn't threatening to men). Now, the narrative is different. Now, it's gaining popularity to be more compassionate and understanding social impacts helps. However, people of color are less likely to get care when they seek it because they don't meet that preconceived notion of the depressed white teen or depressed white housewife or depressed white overworked father. There exists the understood trauma of abuse and poverty, but the narrative of people of color being functional with exhausting anxiety and depression isn't there.

It's not accessible to everyone on the same level and it becomes a fantasy in entertainment, rather than getting the compassionate and understanding representation it needs.



TL;DR: Psych class should stick to the scientific side of understanding and learning and leave the literary flourish to the patients who can better express it since they live with it. Psych students can express their artistry outside of class. Society needs to be more compassionate and less ignorant of mental illness."
"Ah, the Broughton hospital sounds like the perfect environment to make a recovery :). Thank you for sharing"
"Back to you thinking you're the only one who knows the truth.  So more arrogance.

1/10.  Get new material."
Hopefully just intrusive thoughts that are not your own. Sounds like Pure OCD. https://youtu.be/Q9yKaI0vLJs
"I agree, if I'm venting out loud I'm past the point of talking it out rationally. Thank you for sharing :) "
I am not insulting you. Your depression makes you feel that way. Quit letting your emotions think for you.
I notice it much worse in social settings. Like a night and day difference. Does it confirm that it's tics?
"I totally understand. You did the right thing, though, I’m sorry that you’re going through a hard time "
I'm so proud of you!!!! Good for you. I hope you find support from those around you for taking this step :)
I've been randomly thinking that I want to die. But now that i think of it that's probably anxiety as well.
"In the same boat, but due to chronic social anxiety. It sucks hard. Inbox is open if you ever want to chat."
It may be some sort of addictive habit. Some perhaps flawed or even false image that I need therapy forever
"It usually does, but how much it helps depends a lot on how willing you are to let go and forgive yourself."
"It won't haunt her at all, I'm guessing.  She'll be *pissed*, maybe, but she will feel no guilt or remorse."
It's already on the to do list for further down the road.  Right now is about stabilization and boundaries.

That's kind of what happened. I ended up just staring at him and then wishing I would have said something.
"What sort of help got you to where you are now?
I recognise the symptoms but I can’t find any solutions. "
"Yeah I think from now on I might just have to say it as it is, because it needs sorting before its too late"
"Yeah buddy, master first the english language and then we can speak of drawing the ""monalesia"". Understood."
You can NEVER control what people think of you or say. You can control how you feel and respond to others.
You do realize English is one of many languages. And language is art . Can you draw the monalesia perfect?
"You may need to consider inpatient, or look for a therapist that specializes in mindfulness, dpt, cbt etc. "
You spout out some fancy words and think yourself as an genius. So i want to know what your profession is.
"You’ll be fine. Just start taking your normal dose, but run it by your doctor/psych if you’re worried. "
You’re not the only one.  Depression makes you feel bad about having depression.  Definitely frustrating
"i have seen a psychiatrist, i do go to parties and do theatre �� 

i am literally a house of cards tbh "
it's what's worked for me in the past the most to solve most of my problems. it makes me feel normal again.
"Can I have some of that energy here please? My 47-year-old arse can use some ...  


:) Sounds like a bout of mania. I don't know a whole lot about it (well...not without a certain prefix), but I am sure someone will be along soon to let you know what they think. I wish you luck and if you can bottle some of that...just send it my way. I am awfully tired. &lt;3"
"Definitely consider seeing a doctor, and getting into treatment. I would recommend either CBT or DBT. CBT is very common for depression. DBT is very effective form of treatment for many of the symptoms you're describing, it teaches you skills that help you manage and regulate your emotions, how to handle interpersonal relationships, and how to manage distress. "
"Dude, she sounds like a MASSIVE asshole. You need to point this out to your sister, because it sounds like she needs to learn how to make better friends. And why didn't she do anything to keep her friend from doing this stuff? If your sister doesn't do anything about this you need to tell her fried to get out of your house for being a disrespectful little twat."
"I have wondered about this. I was diagnosed in December, but I’m sure I’ve been depressed for at least a couple years. I didn’t start having suicidal episodes until February, after I’d been on an SSRI for- about six weeks, I think? We might have just upped the dose, I don’t recall for sure. And I’ve had suicidal episodes pretty regularly since then."
I’m like that and I think it’s probably the environments and what time it is in the day. Like in one class where your more quiet you might be tired and don’t really enjoy the class but for the ones where you are louder you might really like those classes and the teachers and students and you might just feel more comfortable in that environment to be loud.
"Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm sorry you were traumatized from your experience. Hopefully, he isn't. Since he is 18 he is with the adults now instead of kids so maybe it will be a different experience for him. We just want him to go to therapy &amp; get something out of it. Not sit there and not speak. Once he opens up he may be able to start healing. "
"What makes you think that LSD would just happen to be in your food? 

It might be comforting for you to know that when it comes in contact with certain chemicals it gets destroyed. Also no amount of LSD can kill you, and it takes a LOT to hurt you. You might even enjoy it. If you try LSD even your anxieties about it may go away when you realize its not so bad. "
"[BPD](https://www.psycom.net/depression.central.borderline.html) has several defining symptoms, the largest of which is extreme and unwarranted emotional reactions. 

[Depression](https://www.psycom.net/depression.central.borderline.html) can manifest in several ways, the most obvious of which is sadness that doesn't go away and impacts your daily functioning. "
"\&gt; you give them all the healthy food and necessities they need 

Ah but the SAD (Standard American Diet) is nowhere close to healthy, with all the carbs and sugars suggested. Food and diet causes more mental issues than anything else. Keep the population sick, keep the population thinking they need mental health/excessive medical care, keep the $$$ flowing."
"Probably just bored and need something to do with your hands. I channel all my self-harm thoughts into physical punishment. 

Endurance sports are solo sports that advocate people to try as hard as they can and push their bodies to the limit. I've competed in 10 hours races and currently pushing to do my first 20 hour swim. 

People call it escapism, or having a death wish. I think I'm just not producing enough endorphines with my 9-5 desk job so my body wants punishment.

FYI if you are posting on here. At least you can admit you feel like you are not moving in the right direction. Good on you to ask for help. "
"This happens to me time to time (also self employed). When i feel like that and just can't make myself actually act on my need and/or desire to do stuff i use the little amount of energy i can in preparing to act. Prepare workspace even if not gonna use it, plan photoshoot on paper, buy things im gonna need, read about ""the thing"" etc, make sure when the time comes i just gonna need to ""do the thing"". Sometimes, right away or at some point, this minimal effort approach motivate me to act, sometimes it takes longer. If this happen so often that shit is hitting the fan other steps will need to be taken offcourse. "
"You may find mindfulness meditation very helpful in allowing you to better deal with these thoughts. One reason is that it helps you learn how to separate thoughts from yourself.

Some will summarize this as: ""You are not your thoughts."" A form that others find easier to process is: ""You do not have to believe everything you think.""

Most people, especially in the west, find these foreign concepts. But the idea of not having to believe everything you think can help you take a step back and feel less stressed about the thoughts. It can thus also help you deal with the underlying issues (self-hatred, for example)."
"I recognize that this may be an awful environment, but it is not worth giving your life over. You're a real champ for sticking through all this bullshit, genuinely. Just remember that school is not forever, and if it gets to a point where you can no longer cope, you should talk to a counsellor at your school, a teacher, or your parents if you have the opportunity. I'm so sorry you're going through this love. If you ever believe your life is seriously in danger, CALL THE POLICE. A permanent solution is NEVER the right thing to do for a temporary problem. Coming from someone in high school, I know school feels like forever, but as my mother once said, the people who struggle during school the most are the ones who come out on top. You have so much to live for: your family, your distant friends, and your ambition for physics. You'll get through this, I promise you. "
"I didn’t reword my post, I was just saying I reread it and agree that I didn’t word it as well as I wanted to, might have been because I was tired as fuck or I’m just retarded and didn’t proofread. Either way, the last paragraph I kind of ask without asking if others can relate to these feelings, which I think I expressed properly. I am not asking for anyone to feel bad for me.

I guess nows as good of a time as any to reword what I wanted to convey.

I’m not saying I’m using my mental issues for excuses or anything, maybe I subconsciously am but I’m not actively doing so in the real world. I was wanting to say that I have this voice in my head occasionally when I’m feeling really depressed or anxious that tells me that I want to get attention, which is why I am this way. Maybe this voice has some truth but I’m not sure.

If anything I do the opposite of seeking attention and excusing my short-comings.

Also your wording reads somewhat aggressive, I’m not sure if that’s your intention or not. I’m not trying to say that’s necessarily bad though, maybe that’s what I need, some tough love."

Get your own place. Make it a safe place where you have control. It can be spartan and still make you happy.
Go see a doctor if you haven't already. You need a proper diagnosis. I would also recommend therapy as well.

"Cheers man. It definitely helps to say it out loud to someone who’s really listening. I tried to talk to my mum about it, but I felt like although she was hearing what I was saying, she wasn’t fully listening. If you don’t feel you have that person, I’m there for you man.

It can only get better. Cause I can’t imagine how this shit could feel any worse"

"I had problems like that all through my late childhood to my teenage years. I saw a doctor and I was given an assessment. Then it was a therapist to confirm the diagnosis. It was severe anxiety disorder. I still have it, just definitely not as bad as it was. I can kinda talk to people or groups now. I'd recommend you to see your family physician if you're able. "
"If they haven’t actually put the hold on you, you can either talk to them and see if they will release you, or just go (which would be leaving AMA, against medical advice). Be warned though that if you ask, they may say no, and keep you on the hold - and if you just go, they may consider you even more of a danger to yourself and send police to bring you back. "
I’ve used psychology today also. I like that they had filters so you can filter by issues covered and insurance. I also found reading the profiles very helpful - I probably read 20 before I found someone I wanted to contact. I usually use the first session to basically get the feel of the therapist and see if I want to return. Feel free to ask for more info =]

"Some of the symptoms of ADHD and autism overlap a little. Also, there's ADHD - Inattentive type (doesn't show symptoms of hyperactivity) and the Hyperactive type, as well as a combination of both types. I really hope you figure out what's up.

"That's a really strange reason to break up with someone. If you were stalking someone, you would look for them more than 3 times in 3 years. Check the times you were doing this. See if these are times you would normally be sleeping. Maybe it's a form of sleep walking. I've known people who do some weird shit while they're sleeping. Cooking, eating, driving, etc."
There is definitely more going on than just depression so it's great that you're going to talk to a doctor about it. I haven't experienced that really but I do think about pulling my veins out. I don't have that tingling. That's really interesting. Would you say you have an impulse to rip your skin or just something you keep thinking about? If that makes sense.
"What you are experiencing is normal, it's the normal result of depression, understand that it is the result of depression and doesn't define you as a person.

Since it is the result of depression you should focus on staying on track with your treatment. Think of it as your one, main task every day. Accomplish the task, day by day. It is doable and you can do it."
"Wow it turns out your question on the asktrans subreddit wasn’t stupidity, it was just pure malice. You are a bad person and you should feel bad.

"1. Formatting is your friend.  Try using paragraph breaks next time.

3. Of course, if you *frequently* find yourself threatening to beat up women you think are disrespectful, that may be an issue you want to work on, or at least do some self-reflection on.

4. Would you be within your rights to ask someone to leave somebody else's house?  Probably not.  And even less so to violently throw them out of somebody else's house (or to ""just"" threaten it).  If that is your main concern, try /r/legaladvice."

there were instructions for all these things that i somehow read wrong. shit always happens to me. 

might be useful to mention i score at the very low end on visual-spatial tests and my working memory is quite poor as well. "
"I do a thought exercise every day. Before the day ends I take a thought that really fucks with my mind, write it down, write the fallacies about it (such as: am i overgeneralizing, am i mind reading, am i jumping to conclusions etc) and then i write a thought on the thought that can help my mind (but is believable).

Example:
Thought: I will not fit in the university, Im too awkward and i will have social phobia all throughout the semester.

Fallacies: Fortune telling, all or nothing thinking, emotional reasoning

Healing thought: I may be awkward at times or even most of the time but i wont be awkward all the time. University is not made up of one kind a person- i will find someone who can accept me. Just because im feeling something doesnt mean its the ultimate reality. 

Does it make sense? Hope i can help.
Ps.I learned the exercise from the book Feeling Good. "
"I have hypochondria as well, but in addition to it, the thought of having to be assessed or treated for something (that’s not relatively minor) makes me panic as well, and I’m emetophobic. It’s a bizarre mix I think. Anyway something that helped me at least a little, apart from what else was mentioned in this thread, is just not looking up various illnesses or what the symptoms I’m feeling could be. My pharmacist knows not to give me the medication Info sheet but to tell me the serious things to watch out for, because I will make myself sick thinking about it. So yeah, I just avoid looking that stuff up. My brain is a big ol’ blob of contradictions and anxiety lol. I also work in healthcare and have a decent knowledge of medical stuff so that’s fun ��

Anyway, I hope you’re able to find something that helps because it’s not fun by any stretch. "
"I’ll just give what immediately comes to mind:

A benefit would that the therapist would be hearing multiple perspectives that could be used to help guide either or both of you. Which could also lead into the position of also being able to do effective relationship counseling. 

A risk would be that it’s human nature to develop biases and assumptions and to have favorites. Therapists are, in the end, still people. Good therapists are better at keeping those things out of the equation, but, when I was a teen, I had a couple of therapists who got false and biased information from my parents, and they based their approaches on that info rather than letting me come in and start from a clean slate. In many, if not most, cases, it’s better to be able to start fresh with a therapist without the presence of existing background that comes from a limited perspective. "
"Maybe, maybe not- but hear me out. Maybe not all the way better- never perfect, but nobody is. We all have our quirks and for me, I measure “better” as taking steps to lead a more manageable life. 

For my bf and I, it means taking steps on our own and communicating what works and what doesn’t with our anxiety (both of us), or his depression, or my aspd. A huge part of my life has been working hard on issues that prevent me from leading my life the way I’d like to, but now, it’s just minor tweaks. 

With my anxiety, for example, a huge thing for me that meant getting better was learning how to predict them and how to stay calm in situations I couldn’t avoid. It’s all just really personal. Feel free to view those around you as your team, and if you work together, sometimes your team will notice what you can’t. Use your resources, things get better. "
"The best advice I can give you is that you will only get as much out of therapy as you put in. If you don't give 100% to your behavioral health then the results will suffer as well. Also, its ok if you dont mesh with your doctor/therapist/whatever. If you feel like its not a good fit that's perfectly normal and its ok to find someone else. Anyone who is good at their job will agree as well. If they don't agree then they aren't good enough anyway. 

Its important to research medications and understand them and their interactions with other medications. Be careful with any benzodiazepines. Withdrawls from them and from alcohol can literally be deadly. 

Anxiety is hard. Learn to understand when its your anxiety and when its your natural alarm system. Take your time to heal. Dont compare yourself to others. Trust in your doctor. Learn to trust yourself. You got this!"

For me instead of looking back on my life to see what I've done it's more looking around wondering what I am going to do with my life.

"I don't think the medication makes you a false representation of who you are!  I think of it as the opposite actually.  You are not your mental illness.

"I think 'sociopathic issues' is a bit of an unfair observation to make at this point.

"It's probably not affecting his BPD that much, I don't think.

"&gt;  So my body is depressed for no reason?  

What do you think depression should feel like?  
I think it would be really helpful if you would try to explain what depression means to you.  
And more importantly, what you think the difference between depressed people and yourself is.

&gt;  And how do my symptoms differ from anxiety?  

They do not necessarily differ from anxiety but you mainly listed depressive symptoms.  

Something that is really important to understand, medication does not make you feel better.  
Anti depressants do not ""make you happy"" they just help you with the process of getting better.  "
"Hmmmm, interesting. Is he deeply dissatisfied with something about his life? I’m not scared or disgusted by sleep but I feel annoyed if bedtime rolls around and I haven’t done anything meaningful that day. If one did this every day maybe the annoyance at sleep could grow. I don’t know it’s just a guess. The only other thing I could think of would be something in childhood. When I was young my mum was depressed and often went to bed really early leaving me up by myself which I found quite lonely. She was always tired and I resented that at the time. Could be something like that? Btw your English is fine :) "
"I think a combination of both really helped right at the beginning. Due to some personal finance things I am not currently going to my psychiatrist, but I am able to email him if needed. 

My meds help “more” currently in that I don’t need them in conjunction with a psychiatrist right now, but that doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t help if I went back. 

For what pushed me to finally speak to someone, I think it was my frustration with myself that I never felt like, well, myself. 

To get on meds, that actually took a trip to the emergency room to ultimately find out that it was an anxiety induced migraine. "

Me. I have a bad habit of staying in a job for 1-6 months tops and then “ghosting them.” Just out right disappearing on them with out any notice when depression or anxiety strikes really bad again. It’s only a matter of time before I do this. The only job I was able to keep for a while and actually ending on good terms was this chinese restaurant which was probably the better job I’ve had because I barely had to interact with anyone during it which was amazing for my anxiety and depression. It’s such an issue and I’m afraid of how I’ll be when I get out of college and need to find an “adult” job.
"Yes you are exactly right. It started the school year after I turned 11, which was 6th grade. I have a daughter in that grade now and thankfully, none of my kids were EVER bullied. They never had to go through what I had. I am so grateful for that. In fact, I get a lot of praise about my kids (we have 5 and one of them is in college now) from teachers (they are well behaved, etc) and their peers all seem to like them. Now I don't know if there are any kids who pick on them, but they never seem to hate school or afraid to go, so I am assuming that they are not being harassed. I have so many problems besides my depression, and it seems like one has just cropped up recently and I wasn't prepared for it. I can tell you about it privately, as this is not a thread about me, and I don't want to hijack it. Depression/Anxiety really is a bitch on wheels and I hate it. &lt;3"
"Some days...I don't, to be brutally honest. Of course, my illness is a strange one, so coping is a bit different for me. You should look into counselling. Sometimes you need to go to several different therapists to find the one that clicks the best with you.   


I would do anything to not be mentally ill because we are treated like second-rate pieces of garbage on the shoe of society and nobody wants to understand us. Especially my issue. All they can tell me is ""oh, don't do that--it is so DANGEROUS!"", which is like telling me I have 2  feet or that the sky is blue. They focus on that instead of what I am telling them. It's frustrating that society is like that. That adds to the depression some of us already feel. The only thing I can tell you is take it day by day. Step by step. Minute by minute if you have to. Look for good things in your day, even if it is hard to do so. Go get help, and keep writing here. There are amazing people here and I have felt supported the whole time I've been posting in this subreddit. Just let it out. It's ok. We're here to listen. Good luck to you and I am sending you loads of love."
"Well when she says stuff like "" I've already given you two christmases this year"" in a very blunt way, as if waiting for me to say ""thank you"", implying that because she's sent me two rounds of stuff I didn't ask for I should be happy all the time, it seems like the gifts mean leverage sometimes. Or when she told me that she wished I wouldn't be upset around my birthday because of how much she spent trying to make me enjoy it, as if to make me feel guilty I wasn't all jolly and that I needed to be, because she had sent me things.. it seemed like there was an ulterior thing going on. 

While she may not be, these are the kinds of things my abusive mother has said many times to me after giving me things to bribe me with or try to win affection or feel appreciated. It turns much more volatile with my mother obviously, but the reason I wanted to get opinions about this is because I've had many a counselor tell me to be careful in relationships because sometimes we're unaware of what we attract. 

I do agree it's probably not manipulative, but it doesn't feel *right* if you get me. It feels pushy and it feels like because she's doing this, she wants me to act a certain way and it seems like she's getting way too much out of giving the gifts in almost an addictive way. 

I'm gonna have to address it I know, and time and her reaction will tell what I need to do. Thank you. "

"&gt; The family I have are either drug addicts or broke and barely making it through life themselves.

My sister is a hypochondriac.  Every week she is dying of one thing or another.

Her therapist says that this is often (not always) something from early childhood.  Growing up was there anybody else in the family who was a worrier?  Mom?  Dad?  Crazy Aunt Hazel? "
"First of all i work on healthcare but on my free time i am able to do whatever i wish. Second you asked a question about that you thought you didn't have depression in which i explained but you managed to take it as an insult.

I never said you dont want to treat an issue neither did i mentioned what you where going through. Please stop deleting your past comments"
"Honestly I feel immensely better since I started my medication. I already went through therapy before trying Lexapro so I knew what I needed to do and change, the medication just helps me do it. Before I wasn’t able to implement the coping skills my therapist was trying to teach me and now I can. Plus I sleep like a baby every night which is healing on its own. "
"I SO hear this. I try to tell people what is going on, and all of a sudden they have 100 things to do and ""will get back to me soon""...which they never do.

"I have an actual label for it now too so maybe that’ll make it easier. I could just send him a quick message saying, “I think I have dysthymia or something similar, I’ve felt this way for a long time. How can we fix this?” And either he helps me or I can just move out on my own or something ��‍♂️. It would be pretty hard but I think I could do it"
"I've had depression and have bipolar disorder. My advice for dealing with depression is to accept it. Accept that life sucks and you are not happy. Accept whatever stupid story your mind is telling you. In a weird way it eases the fighting and let's you be at peace.
Anyway, that was my little recommendation. See if you want to use it. I hope you feel better anyway"
"It took me 12 years to get proper help, I sat in front of my doctor after an attempt and she looked me dead in the eye and said ‘there’s nothing wrong with you just go home and grow up’

"Learning to process emotions is part of becoming an adult. In your case I would suspect something that stymied your ability to do this, even as a child, is stopping you now.

"NO prob. Eating is GOOD. :) 
What did you have? Anything interesting?

We went out to a Chinese-American buffet today with the family. It was DELISH. I had sushi and I had shrimp and stuffed clams. :D Drank a Pepsi. Had a lot of laughs with the kids and I almost felt...NORMAL for that short time. Then we got ice cream. YUMMIE! :D Now I am full and sleepy as heck. "
"We tie our emotions and general mental well-being so closely to our friends sometimes. They're our support, being with them makes us happy, what else could be better? And then you see them being happy without you, and it can just play on those little insecurities and bits of loneliness in your mind.

Feels horrible, but is completely normal my friend. Don't panic."
"You need to sit down and clear your head. I can't give you much advice but if things keep getting worse, then you need to see a doctor as soon as possible. I'm not sure if you're currently on medication right now. But if not, then you need to talk to a doctor and get on something. These symptoms aren't something you want to ignore. Get help if you haven't already."
"I can't hope to understand your pain, but at least you had friends who cared to take you to the bar. I don't know if you live somewhere where your not accepted but there are places where you would be. I can get depression making you sleep I've lost days to it in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

You need to try to get out there and find things that make you feel alive and make life worth living. I'm not sure if you have healthcare because I'm also american and I know how hard that can suck, but if you do you should see someone and explore medications.

"It's really very difficult to get a good idea of what a company's culture is like without actually working there. Sometimes there are red flags, but a lot of times I find that you just sort of have to roll the dice. 

The good thing is that most companies are fine, or at least have individual people who make it worthwhile even if the company itself is poor. You seem to have gotten the worst possible, which is a real shame for your first job. 

I don't think most college educated people feel the way you do about their jobs. While it's not always sunshine and roses, it definitely gets a lot better than you describe. "
"Are you willing to share what you do?

If you’ve got all this free time and side projects why not work on one of them BUT at a rate that isn’t going to stress or tire you out? If they are things that wouldn’t get done anyway who cares if they get done slowly? If you can get away with playing around on social media so much there must be something more productive that you can do and since nobody seems to be monitoring you it sounds like it could be anything you want! Do a personal project if you want! 

Don’t fritter away time on social media bullshit.

I would LOVE to have time to deal with real projects let alone side projects at work. Being able to spend time on something that would help me develop would be even better! 

Come up with something you really want to do, do it at your own pace, and try to make it seem at least a bit work related if you have to!"
"Thanks for the advice and suggestions :) and I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me, it means a lot.
 I feel like I'm prepared for her return home this week with some exceptions.She has been much better since she got a few days of good sleep. But just today she keeps saying how tired she is, and that she can't sleep through the night. She wakes up around 3 a.m and then can't fall back asleep,tossing and turning. All she wants to do is come home and sleep in her own bed :(

I know if she doesn't correct her sleeping pattern then she is sure to regress. I'm trying to find a way to get her to relax enough to fall and stay asleep when she gets home. Lack of sleep was one of the main causes of this breakdown and I know her body NEEDS to catch up on sleep before she can return home. Do a lot of people have this issue during and after a mental breakdown?

"That is really the only choice. I know it is hard telling them, but you might have to. I have been there (almost died by my own hand twice within 6 weeks of each other in 2015) and I didn't tell my husband at all that I was getting to the point of suicide again before the attempts. He was caught off-guard when I tried to take a bottle of pills in front of him. Got tackled by the police too that night and carted off to the hospital where I was violently ill for hours before they finally gave me some medicine for the vomiting. I saw Death in the corner of the room (probably just a hallucination formed by my mind trying to comprehend all that pain I had been in), and it was scary as hell. Please PLEASE tell them. Your life is worth more than anything, and unless they're abusive (I hope not!), they will want what is best for you. Good luck. Let me know how things go ok?"

"&gt; So it's like development disorders? What is the point of therapy if it can't fix the psyche?

It's not considered to be like developmental disorders because it's not considered to be a disorder, but essentially yes, the principle is similar, it's ingrained and can be managed but not treated (psychologically). Therapy is an excellent tool, but like any tool it's only right for certain jobs. This is one job therapy is not right for.

&gt; I can't believe that making myself a freak is the only medically accepted treatment. I'd rather die. I wish this was a more socially accepted choice.

It's not a matter of medically or socially accepted. It's a matter of what works. And not every trans person transitions, surgically or hormonally, so making yourself a ""freak"" (you're speaking in a group that contains trans people so that language is not exactly ideal) is not your only option. But the people who don't transition are the people who are, although trans, mostly comfortable with their body.

Gender services might be able to help you find some peace with your body. You will still be trans, but you might have less dysphoria. Ultimately though a lot of the work there comes from you, it's internal. And a lot of it is luck of the draw, if you just happen to be someone who truly does not connect with their body, you might be stuck with that feeling unless and until you transition. What manner of transition works for you may vary, maybe hormones would relieve your dysphoria and you wouldn't need surgery. There's no way to know.

&gt; There must be some medication that helps.

There isn't. That is the fact of your situation. There is no drug that makes this stop, if there was they'd be forcing it down every trans person's throat, social acceptability be damned.

Being trans is a very hard road. Coming to terms with it is by no means the hardest part. I wish you the best of luck."

"I think the dual relationship is inevitable, given the size and closeness of our community. We are very small. "
I write a little note somewhere I can see that says a positive message and surround it with hearts and flowers!
"I've been taught these things for a long time man, it becomes *manageable* but it's always there and it sucks. "
If things don't work out. Remember that you can always message me to get some of this stuff out of your system.
Im trying to not walk with cash and to the places i go have minimum like $10 card fees to deter my eating there
It's just nice to have common ground with someone because I would never admit any of these issues in real life.
"I’m interested to help out :) I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, generalized anxiety, and bipolar. "
I’m the same. It’s as if there is a part of me that is seeking death whilst the rest of me is busy working.
"Know well: anxiety, depression, PTSD
Know a bit but have skewed ideas about: BPD, bipolar, DID, schizophrenia. "
"Nothing to apologize for, I know that place. Just take care of yourself, K? Much Love and Infinite Mojo to ya'!"
"See, my anxiety randomly just spikes. So, that's hard to answer! Still with grounding techniques. You got this!"
"Take it moment by moment. If that’s too much, second by second. Step outside of yourself if at all possible. "
Thanks. I just hate when they call me a fuckup. At least she doesn't beat me since she got her new husband haha
The only way you'll ever be able to make any more progress is by apologizing. But that's your decision to make.
What's your name or what school are you going to shoot up? Why not tell there's nothing to lose at this point.
YAY! Glad to hear someone else knows my pain. :D I can LOOK at a donut and gain 5 pounds. Sheesh...for real. ;)
"Yeah, it really does make me feel a bit better. 

I can't believe how hard it is to make yourself feel better. "
Yes. I can’t stress this enough. This is exactly what happened to me. The bad feelings just slowly fade away.

"yes! diet is important. Take enough vitamins as well. 5htp is good for mood regulation, anxiety/depression.

"God, no.  You have no obligation to lift a single fucking finger to help anyone you don't want to, not even with your past.  You could tell them in public--in the middle of the cafeteria on the busiest day of the year, in front of their grandparents--to get fucked and leave you alone to eat your damn lunch in peace and you would still be in the right.  

Good luck."
"Good for you, thanks for doing this.

"Grief is weird and unique to each instance of loss it comes with. Theres no prescribed way to mourn, and definitely no right or wrong. I vomited when I first found out about my friend, the tears came when I saw her mum. Your tears may or may not come, and they might come with laughter at a silly memory, with or with out warning. It's a process.

All the best to you"
"Hey, not telling anyone to ‘snap out of it’ lol u clearly misinterpreted my post �� as someone who ALSO struggles with depression, just giving a tip to ease the pain. Sometimes something as simple as an act of taking care of yourself can get you through the day. It’s a gentle reminder BECAUSE, like you said, it’s commonly forgotten by those who suffer. "
"I am SO sorry... That is so awful... I think you need to allow yourself time to grieve, it's totally normal. Pets are family so your response is Imo a normal reaction to such a big loss, and a traumatic one at that. Be gentle and kind with yourself, time will make it easier. Maybe make him a memorial or something to provide you with some closure. I'm sorry again :("
"I can't be at work  without my wireless earbuds. I feel you on when they broke, I was so shitty. it's so much better listening to my playlists and feeling some way because of the music. euphoric if I had to put it in words.

Whenever I'm in the car I always crave my music so I can be in tune with my true self, or i'll feel shitty or tune out the world"
"I think about this a lot. I think the main reason that people get on so easily with their lives is that they don’t think about it. All they think is that they have to make a living and provide for their families and maintain their job etc, without really ever stopping to think why they’re doing it. 

In short, ignorance. Ignorance is what allows people to live "
"I'm actually wondering myself, as I've had beliefs in the past that now that I look back I'm sure that those were delusions, could have been psychotic depression as I have depression, along with several other issues. So I'm just wondering if it's as a result of something bigger. I would have thought your SIL has bipolar, but I don't know a lot about schizophrenia. "
"If you are completely alone you should consider getting a job and save up for a move. It will be messed up not to tell him that you're planning on leaving, but you gotta survive as well. 

Unless you have friends that will support you, no one is going to give you handouts. You're gonna have to become a fighter in spite of your anxiety or whatever you have going on."
"I’ve been to the ER 4 times (including this last one) for this. Usually I can use the grounding techniques I’ve learned and be okay, but sometimes I get so dissociative I go into seizures or I get the urge to harm myself as a way to ground myself into reality. The times it’s been to that level of severity were the times I went to the ER. And I’m in the US. "
"Showering. Sometimes I get into a real bad funk and I will literally just lay in bed for a week straight and even the simple task of having a shower is just so so so far out of reach. The bathroom is 5 steps away but I still can’t bring myself to do it. It just seems so hard. Don’t let him make you feel bad about it, some people just really don’t understand. "
That’s how I’ve felt. Though my experience is less than half what you went through. I went through 2 doctors. The second one recommended I try therapy first. Both him and the psychologist were awesome and we were able to start making small improvements. Unfortunately I couldnt afford to keep going and eventually moved out of state when other things happened.
"I think the best thing you can do is talk to someone about it and be patient. I'm lucky that I'm really close to my mum, and since we both went through the same thing we were able to counsel each other in effect, but it was many years before I could actually consider my brain to be free-thinking again. 

But even now there's still things that get me. There's still certain bands that I can't listen to because it's like it gives rise to this innate fear that I'm definitely going to burn for eternity for listening to this kind of music. It's tough, it's probably never going to leave completely, but it does get better. "
"I used to game a lot for the last two years and I liked it but the whole time I felt like something was missing. Not seeing people face to face and having real convo made me feel so detached. I do live with my parents but nobody in my family knows anything about me, the only people I've ever talked to were my old friends who I never see anymore. I feel so empty when I'm not at school because I just feel so alone, the weekends are the worst. It's so odd, I hate group work because it makes me anxious but I love it because it just feels so good to talk to people, but in the end it's just school work, we're not friends."
"I would not diagnose you with bipolar. It sounds like you're having normal fluctuation of moods. When people struggle with bipolar it is episodic, so the symptoms do not shift in a few hours. For a bipolar diagnosis you would need to have depressive episodes and either manic or hypomanic episodes. A depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks and a manic/hypomanic episode must last 1 week. It doesnt sound like your symptoms last that long. Also, if you're able to control the moods and they arent interfering with functioning then a clinical diagnosis is not necessary.  I based my answer off of the DSM-V criteria.  "
"It sounds like your parents are kind of using that dx to define you. You should be able to fly as high as you can, dear. Take it from a mama who has a daughter in college now. She is almost 20 and is at a very difficult school to get into, and she is doing very well. I would never tell her she couldn't do something she really wanted to so because she has some kind of ""disability"" (she doesn't). Now, our boys DO have Asperger's (all 3 of them--lucky me!) but I still want them to go as far as they can. I support them whatever they want to do. :) Fly, young bird. Fly as high as you can and soar. &lt;3 Good luck to you!"
"Well, many therapist wont work, and some will work wonders

Im a young teenager that has accepted that I will forever be single. I just can't imagine ever being in a relationship. As with friends I haven't really had a close friend because I split ways with them. All the people in my classes have their own friend group and judges anyone who wants to join. I get pretty obsessive about topics and it scares people away now. I just have no idea what would fix me right now other than some serious personality changes, but recently whenever I've tried fixing my self esteem issues I feel like I am just increasing my ego. 

"
"Yup, this. 

Don’t fight the delusions but don’t feed into them either. When my clients decompensated and became delusional I used the word okay a lot. (As in, him: “there are gangs out to get me.” Me: Okay. Did you have lunch yet?”)

If your friend is established with any outpatient providers, he needs an appointment. A psychiatrist may be able to have him admitted for more than just the 72 hours or whatever he was just in for, or may be able to get him to an intensive outpatient appointment. I have spent hours of my life gently convincing delusional clients to agree go to their outpatient psychiatrists. "
"find someone to talk to. a crisis line, a therapist, or a friend, or family or your partner. This is overwhelming you to the point that your mind is distancing itself from the emotions. You need an outlet. also, screw the military. i'm pissed that you served 5 years and this is all you get back in return. it undermines all the hard work you put into transitioning, and it's a slap in the face. they stole so much from you (physically/mentally), and this is the nail in the coffin. it's not right, and it's not okay.

i'm wishing you the best man, you really really deserve it. just do what's right  for you in the moment."
"&gt; she’d had a change of heart

she lost her respect and attraction towards you.  That's it.  Let her go. Don't try to figure it out or get an explanation. 

&gt;There was a guy who gave her some attention, but I don’t believe she pursued that.

Believe that she did. 

""In other words, a woman may be attracted to only one man at any given time, but as the status and fortune of various men fluctuates, a woman's attention may shift from a declining man to an ascendant man.""

&gt;something that was so perfect

it was not perfect and you know that.  she's not yours anymore.  Living paycheck to paycheck, debts, and other stressors... you were part of that, rightly or wrongly, she attributed the failure to you, you are the man, she is just a woman and she cannot be held accountable for anything, anything that goes wrong is your fault...that's how it works these days."
"Absolutely common to run across any mental health medication that do something beneficial but don't address other issues, or cause other issues.

Best thing generally is to get in with a psychiatrist when you start running into issues as you want the expertise and familiarity with the medications.

I would think in your case it's probably a case of either increasing the dose (though may not be an option, I know dosing on Prozac for OCD is typically on the higher end) or augmentation by adding something else (Wellbutrin, anti psychotic, etc.).

I take four right now that are working OK together (absolutely the best medication has ever worked).  They work very well together and kind of balance side effects out too.  

The good news is that generally OCD is harder to treat than depression.

You can also think about therapy instead of altering medications or doing both. "
"Are you ready to have your mind blown? 

BeyondBlue is an Australian organization that puts together guides for dealing with depression and anxiety. It was there that I learned about one coping mechanism that probably is the reason for your inability to finish tasks. Its called distraction, no joke. [http://resources.beyondblue.org.au/prism/file?token=BL/0556](http://resources.beyondblue.org.au/prism/file?token=BL/0556) (page 46)

As a response to dealing with depression and to avoid self-harm an individual might create distractions to avoid problems. Its a coping technique that triggers during stressful times.

 I dealt with depression for a long time on my own and now I feel like distraction is hard grained into my personality. 

The way I deal with it is by taking on smaller projects and setting reasonable expectations for myself in what I think I can accomplish. "
"Your thought is not irrational at all, it just sounds that it's the fact that we are not taught this shit in school.

You are more likely to make money doing something that you love than doing something than you don't.

However don't just follow your dreams carelessly, money is important, but there's a threshold when money stops being important; you need to find that balance, what you do is to play the social game, you need to try to guarantee as much success as possible, no matter the means.

What I mean is that you need to be effective, you need to do as little work as possible for the biggest monetary outcome so that you then have more free time to enjoy to yourself rather than worrying. This includes things like learning how to invest, figure out your taxes, investing on your health, and remove debt, refuse any form of debt; get a scholarship, do whatever you need not to pay for uni, whatever it takes.

When you maximize your effectiveness you can as a matter of fact reduce your work time, to the level that it makes you happy, having time to explore the world and whatnot; if you manage to get to absolute efficiency then you won't really need to work other than care of your investments, even making as little as 300$ per month, you'd be happier that way.

Now you have to see where in that situation does having a degree in engineering is, consider:
 - Does it put you in debt?
 - What's the happiness/effectiveness correlation?.

I recommend you to watch youtube videos on the topics of investing, debt, taxes, business, finances and whatnot; these will remove your very rational fears and help you to take the right choice."
"Thank you for sharing this. 

I don't think my experiences are the same thing, mostly because there was no terror associated... Though there was a feeling of panic. 

I would start to notice that my hands felt abnormally large, like Mickey mouse hands. And when I touched my teeth together it was like they were huge and somehow more sensitive. Not painful just, idk more aware of my jaw closing and my top teeth coming into contact with the bottom ones. Like my mouth was as big as a football stadium and could feel that big sensation.  

Then my thoughts would go from normal to frantic. Like I'd think ""I wonder what time it is"" and the voice thinking it wouldn't be calm and normal, it would be like someone freaking out. Every single thought. Freaking out lady in my head. But the thoughts weren't different in content than usual, just screaming and panicked in tone. 

I would eventually start to feel that feeling of time moving painfully slowly while at the same time feeling like my body was working on fast forward. But I'd look down at my hands and they wouldn't be moving any differently, so that was really disorienting.

This got to happen less and less as I got older. I'm 36 now and I can't remember the last time it happened. This is the first time I've talked about it as these words don't adequately explain the experience and I feel like no one will understand what I'm trying to say. Nice to have the chance to maybe be understood, thank you. 

Edit: just looked it up and holy crap, maybe that is what I was experiencing even though I wasn't afraid during it. From wiki  
&gt;The person affected by Alice in Wonderland Syndrome may also lose the sense of time, a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective. In other words, time seems to pass very slowly, akin to an LSD experience. The lack of time, and space, perspective leads to a distorted sense of velocity. For example, one could be inching along ever so slowly in reality, yet it would seem as if one were sprinting uncontrollably along a moving walkway, leading to severe, overwhelming disorientation. 

That so perfectly explains what I was feeling re time. Crazy! "

"
Don't go out of your way to show them off. I would not recommend telling these kids the real reason behind the scars. Just make something up and remember to be consistent with what you say. Never hurt yourself like that again. Those scars will take awhile to heal and go away. And you don't want to live your life walking around with the reminder of your painful past.
I actually just made an appointment at the local student health center for anxiety. Hopefully I can get Clonidine too I think that will definitely calm my nerves a bit. I’m sorry to hear you had to go through this ridiculousness too! But I’m glad it worked out for you! I may very well end up chatting with you! You have been amazing and have made me smile a bit!
"I Had a psychiatrist tell me that I probably wear people out so now I'm scared that I'm going to lose all my friends. I know the struggle, I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and dysthymia with general anxiety disorder. I've been battling for over 20 years now. One of the thing that keeps me alive are my pets. My dog and my cat won't be able to process my death, the only thing they know is that I abandoned them. I can't let them down like that. Keep fighting the good fight, you are not alone and I'm sure your cat loves you very much and that's a good thing to focus on when you're lost in the darkness. "
"No, unless you had a clearly defined psychotic illness. Not permanent if you did though long term treatment would seem more appropriate.

Well high dose (or combination) antidepressants +/- an antipsychotic (I usually recommend quetiapine) would be my way of managing severe mood/anxiety states, alongside psychology (which is as important as the meds). I dont know you obviously, so cant/couldn't advise specifically for you.

Its always a risk when meds are being changed - but as long as there's clear communication between patient and prescriber then it usually works out. At worst you return to your original treatment."
"Same situation here. I’m worried I’ll never untangle what I was conditioned to believe or not. I find I try to be open minded and think outside “the box” but then that fear is always whispering in the back of mind “what if they were right, you will be punished”. 

I was so alone in questioning it when I was young and still kind of alone now because most people I talk to can’t relate. 

The biggest side effect for me is this constant guilt and anxiety I feel that I will screw up and even though they won’t be there to say “I told you so”, something in the back of my mind will be saying it for them. "
"i’m the same as you, when i was younger i was a lot worse though. over the years i’ve gotten a tougher skin in general, however i still cry over the smallest things, for example i went to watch the meg with my boyfriend the other day and i cried at a death scene in that lol. i don’t see it as a bad thing, it’s a part of who you are (unless it’s actually a disorder or something) i like that i’m sensitive, it makes life more vibrant. i’d take being sensitive over being numb any day, i spent years feeling absolutely nothing because i was so depressed and it was shit. embrace it, emotions are part of life. "
"I think being kind is extremely important and has always been a thing I try to live by. 90% of the time, those who are acting out DO need that compassion. 

This does come with an important caveat, though. Often, there is a very good reason those people are not getting that compassion from someone else already, and I need to protect myself too. If I'm not well enough to deal with helping someone who may lash out at me, then my own emotional safety comes first. 

I think an important part of being a good person is extending compassion to yourself, as well. You can't help anyone if you're a mess from supporting harsh and abusive people who can't control their behaviour. (Not saying this kid in particular was harsh or abusive, just explaining why extending support to everyone may be unwise.) 

I also wish the world was a nicer place and I commend you for wanting it too. "
"I wrote a blog post on this but I don’t want to seem like I’m self promoting so here’s what that section said:

It is incredibly normal for this to occur. You can become so overwhelmed by something that you find yourself unable to get out of bed for fear of the tasks you have to do. This can seem even trickier to navigate and can lead to a vicious cycle of not being able to do something because you're worried about the fact you haven't done it yet. Here's what to do:Treat it, first and foremost, as a usual depressive episode. It may seem more severe especially if you have a reason you need to be out of bed but if staying in bed is the right thing to do for your health then that should still be what you do. Focus on your basic needs first and then drip feed yourself challenges you need to face as the day goes on.Try and get someone to help you. Whether they are chatting on the phone or sat on your bedside, vocalising way you are feeling can often put things in perspective. Ask people around you to get your clothes for you or maybe some breakfast. They may even be able to help you with what you are worrying about.Challenge yourself to do things in short minute long bursts. It is often starting something that is the hardest part so you may well continue with whatever you were doing now that you've started. Just be kind to yourself and if you need to stop, then stop."
"Just a quick helpful tip, PTSD and CPTSD are often misunderstood as needing a very stressful cause, like physical abuse, a car accident, being in a war zone, sexual abuse, etc..

This is far from the truth. Trauma is unresolved stress, nothing more than that. The extreme situations often cause lasting problems because the stress is insanely high, and nearly no-one is equipped to deal with stress that intense.

However... Given what your parents are telling you, they're not helping you process your emotions. It's something I see over and over on this subreddit, ""what is this weird detached feeling I have?"" ""It's dissociation, you might have cptsd"", ""oh but I was never abused"", ""have you seen a therapist?"", ""No I haven't, my parents don't want me to go to therapy, they don't believe in it"".

And that's likely exactly the problem. The people who're supposed to teach you how to deal with major and minor everyday stresses are actively telling you to ""just do X"". That doesn't sound anywhere near helpful, if anything, it sounds like emotional neglect. If you're feeling bad, do you remember a time where one of your parents told you it's going to be ok? Where they hugged you and let you cry it out? Or allowed to let you get your anger out without telling you that you're a bad person for being angry? If they haven't, then that's like 99% sure the reason why you're feeling dissociated, they're literally telling you to ignore your emotions, and that's what dissociation is, a learned detachment from your emotions and feelings.

Trauma is decidedly _not about abuse_, again, it's about _unprocessed stress_, or _unprocessed negative emotions_ if you like.

Some resources for you to Google:

* Childhood emotional neglect -- see if the concept matches your story
* CPTSD
* The body keeps the score, a fantastic introduction to what trauma is really about
* Pete Walker's books and his website"
"&gt;**I'm quite familiar with developmental conditions such as autism which would explain but can't be sure myself.**  

Murkey, you are not describing autism symptoms here.  I've never heard of an autistic person who has ""great social skills"" and ""no trouble making friends or striking conversations with complete and total strangers."" 

&gt;**He gets along with people really well even though he says he is an introvert.** 

It is very common for introverts to get along well with other people.  This is why many introverts can do well in jobs where they interact with people all day long.  Yet, being around other people -- particularly crowds of people -- tires them out, making them want to spend time alone later that day.  In contrast, extroverts find it energizing to be around other people.

&gt;**Has been becoming increasingly distant and now refuses now to join us on  family days out, meals, or planned events and seemingly takes no  interest in maintaining familial relationships.**

This is concerning behavior for a family member who shows ""no sign of any kind of anger"" and ""normally loves meetups.""   It is unfortunate he refuses to talk to anyone about it and instead claims he is ""tired.""  Significantly, you are describing a man who loves to join groups of friends and strangers but who avoids all family gatherings.  Are you sure about the ""no sign of any kind of anger""?  I ask because you say that, during adolescence, he sometimes became violent with you.  Has that lack of emotional control -- which is common in teenagers -- continued into his adulthood?

&gt;**He's always acted a bit strange just in general.**

What effect has this had on his relationships with GFs?  Has he been able to successfully sustain close intimate relationships -- outside the family -- for years?  I ask because, if the childhood abuse had resulted in his having moderate to strong traits of a personality disorder, those traits likely would be strongest around loved ones (because they are the ones who are able to trigger his fears).  This means, however, that he likely would be pushing his GFs away in the same way he is pushing family members away."

"Thank you my dear. It takes baby steps, a lot of them, but every one counts so so much. Wishing you all the love!"
Thank you you are very kind to take your time to help a stranger on the internet. Have a wonderful day my friend.
Thanks man. The urges are there. Just burned some toilet tissue in the bathroom ... it is harder to resist today.

That sucks. sorry for your loss. The best thing you can do is catch it early and give them 100% support. I think.
"That's not what I meant. I mean what are you talking about? Something about a parasite?
I genuinely want to know."
That’s how I felt too and I felt so bad for thinking that. I’d hate to make someone’s mental health worse!?
Xanax is crazy and I’m amazed it’s legal. Throw a little alcohol into the mix and it’s guarenteed Black out
Yes. Tell them. They are going to be in way worse shape if they figure it out on their own or something happens.
Yup. I’ll deal with them firing me when/if it comes to that. I’ve decided to try and survive the coming day.
very true. i just have to scout around for awhile until i find the right person i suppose. thanks for the advice
Aw sweetie. Can you talk to someone about this? You sound so much like me in my younger years. I can offer a lot of hugs for you...just remember you ARE beautiful no matter what anyone says about you. Take that beauty inside you and run with it and know that people are going to love you for who you are (sounds like your bf already does!) ... I wish you so much love.
"Even if you seemingly have mental health issues from out of no where or for “no reason”, it isn’t your fault. Some of my mental health issues are due to trauma and some of them are the “no reason” type thing. Sometimes our brains just struggle to make/use/recognize the proper neurotransmitters to keep us feeling mentally healthy, and that not your fault. :)"
I agree about focusing on you. I just sensed a very misogynistic tone in his words and i don’t agree that you should limit yourself to male therapists and I don’t agree that you weren’t enough of a man for her or that she was cheating/leaving u for another dude. Just wanted to add some perspective that TRP dudes universalize and see things from one perspective
"I like this answer. There are going to be many scenarios where you find someone who you are uncomfortable with that are your boss, mentor, officer, contractor, etc. It's an opportunity to except who you are and not be upset others for their accomplishments.  As someone who is graduating at 30 due to an illness trust me I do understand how shitty it can feel at times."
Makes sense to me. I've had many years of psychiatric treatment and it's all been useless. Doctors don't even attempt to work out what's actually going on. And now I have developed the self-image of being a mentally ill freak. None of the programs and such I have ever done helped. There is no good help available. Hate this bleating about 'it gets better' from idiots.
"Thanks. It IS pyromania. I have already been diagnosed...:( I just hate saying that word. My mind does this stick-fingers-in-ears-and-go-lalalalalala thing on me whenever I see or hear it. That is so weird because one of my favorite songs is ""Pyromania"" by Cascada...and I can sing that just fine. -_- Yes, I get the irony in that. I wish you lots of love and luck too!"
"That is a really good reason, mental health stuff can impact your ability to get some careers. Totally smart choice from that perspective.

Are you working on your depression yourself? Reading about it, trying the advice, etc? That can be one way of coping without needing any paperwork. And there are anonymous ways you can get support for depression, online, I think."
"That's a tough combo to deal with. I feel like I'm not made for the World sometimes too. It seems like it's too much alienation at times, and alienation is the worst feeling. You can find your way to a day where you don't have to deal or live with those judgmental people, if you find a path, be it a career or a lifestyle, a time where you always know your next moves."
"This is called Bi-Polar...You may not have been clinically diagnosed but from the things you stated...Those are the telltale signs. You have extreme highs and extreme lows....hardly, if any in between.  There is medicine for this. It worked for me and I did notice a major difference when I took it.

"Yea that specialist part is why I stopped going. I got the meds then didn't get the bill which was  200$ until the day BEFORE my next appointment. Which I can't pay now because the job I was working at I could afford to pay now I can't. 
So im stuck picking and choosing which days to take my meds that barely work till I can get a job where I can afford to pay again. "
"I also don't really celebrate my birthday. The catch is I choose to although I felt rather sad about it. 
I'm introvert. If I wish to celebrate a special event I prefer do it myself. For example, I love driving. I take a long alternative route to home while blasting my favorite music with full on bass, and I was satisfied with it.
Maybe you and I are people in two different worlds. But I hope this can help you.
Also, find professional help about your drug problems. It may or may not be the main problem of your current situation. No matter it is, the heavy reliance on drug will be a obstacle of any form in your future."
"I feel exactly the same way, I thought about having a will for a long time as well. You could die at any given second by some other idiot’s doings, like a traffic accident that isn’t even your fault for example.

I agree with you on religions, I think it’s the same thing too - they were created as a way for people to feel good about this whole issue. I can’t imagine how useless a person having an existential crisis would feel 2000 years ago with no immediate access to a wealth of knowledge or help (the internet and public services!).

I don’t know man, I guess we’ll see. Hope it’s a long road until then!"
"it's hard to not have any vices when you're depressed. i used to eat junk all the time, but because of my metabolism i didn't gain any weight, just got acne. i got really into lifting weights some years ago after cleaning up my diet, and then slowly added the junk back in, but now it's not an issue because i'm also working off the calories. so when i wanna eat shitty things, i can. that's what i'd recommend. basically clean up your diet, lose a bit of weight and keep it off by going to gym regularly, and then add the comfort foods back in, just not in mass quantities like before. YMMV of course, worked for me though. "
"Don't. Cymbalta withdrawals are hell (I'm on it and have been on effexor previously). Abilify is obviously a mood stabilizer, and medication compliance with mood stabilizers is notoriously low because a lot of people decide to stop taking them. Most of the people I met in inpatient were there because they stopped taking their BP meds.

If you really want to do this, find a doctor who supports the decision and work with them.

Finally, examine why you want to do this. While holistic can work for some people, there are some illnesses (like BP) that pretty much always require medication when more severe. If it's depression that's a little easier. Obviously it's a risk, and if it goes wrong you want a medical professional to evaluate you and keep you safe. If yours doesn't think it's a good idea, get a second opinion if you like, but most of the time there's a good reason."
"I have a strange disorder (I am a fire-starter, obsessed with fire, a fire-bug) that is very unlikely to be ""cured"" in someone my age group. As for Depression--I don't think personally I will ever be ""cured"". I have learned how to manage it and the warning signs for when it is getting bad again. Same for my Anxiety. The other issues I had gotten through (Anorexia, Self-Harm and Alcoholism) have been ""cured"" but it is a lifetime of maintenance now for me so I don't relapse.  


The Fire-setting and Anxiety are closely entwined. When I get stressed, I start fires to get rid of that tension, and it works. I feel satisfied, relieved, and happy after I do so. I try to maintain both these conditions, but it has been worse over the past week. Hopefully a Therapist (on a waiting list) will help me find ways to cope. If you have any specific questions, you can message me. :)  
"
"Well I'm not sure how it works in the UK, but over here you first fill in a questionairre and are then asked some one-on-one questions by a professional.  


THE. BEST. ADVICE. is to be honest! I know some things can be incredibly hard to talk about because you feel ashamed or don't want to go to that place. Please remember that the people there are trying to help you and that getting help is nothing to be ashamed about!  
I personally left out some things the first time I got an assessment and it only worked against me.  


Another good advice, although it might be for later in the process, is to never be afraid to ask if you can change who helps you. Your own mental state is a very personal thing and if you, for whatever reason, feel uncomfortable or uneasy with someone, don't be afraid to ask if you can switch!

Good luck tomorrow and I hope you find some good help."
"I can strongly relate to this post. 

After I was emotionally traumatized I experienced the same thing. I didn't feel anything other than anxiety and pain for \~11 years. In this time, I questioned whether or not I was a sociopath as well. After such emotional trauma it is normal to build walls up around your heart, so to speak, as to protect yourself from the tsunami of pain and tragedy flowing in at the time; yes, even without the knowledge that the walls are being built. The problem here is that while these walls do in fact protect us from the negative, it also ""protects"" us from the good as well. Also, it takes a REALLY big and strong wall to stop a tsunami, and something even stronger to tear down that wall. In my case, long-term psychotherapy aided with medication (Adderall) helped enormously. It is important to keep in mind that there is nothing weird or shameful here. The mind and body have mechanisms in place to protect itself, as does every other living thing. 

Be aware that this is my experience and that it may not be yours, and that's fine. But if it is, then there is hope, you just got a lot of work to do!"
"I’ve had the “we don’t want to label you” crap from mental health professionals too. To me it doesn’t make any sense. I’m the one experiencing the illness so surely I have a right to know what my diagnosis is? We shouldn’t need a reason to want to know.

I mean, if you had a physical health problem and had a bunch of tests and stuff and the doctor was like “I don’t want to tell you what you have, we’re just going to focus on treating it”, wouldn’t you find that pretty weird?

I want to know what my diagnosis is so I can understand my thoughts and behaviours better, so I can accept that I have a recognised illness and not just some vague issues. Also it’s a hell of a lot easier to tell someone “I have [diagnosis]” rather than “well I have some kind of mental health problem, I get [XYZ] symptoms, but idk what it is really haha...”.

“I don’t want to label you” is such crap. Since finally getting my “label” a couple of months ago after 8+ years in the system it’s become so much easier to recognise my symptoms and understand myself, meaning treatment should be easier to process."
"Guided meditation is the best thing I can recommend for controlling anxious thoughts. It takes commitment and won't work overnight, but doing 10 minutes every day is more than enough. So maybe just focus on that for now. Headspace is free to start and it had totally changed my relationship with anxiety.

I don't want to overwhelm you with suggestions so I'll stick with this one, which anyone can do.

As far as medication is concerned, I'm going to refrain from commenting too much because I don't know what meds they suggested and, even if I did, I'm no doctor. It's ultimately between you and your therapist whether you should take them. They may help you, or they may not. If they don't, you can try other meds and find what works for you. But if you are adamant that you don't want to take them (which is definitely your right) then tell your therapist that and focus on psychological therapy instead. Either way, keep going to therapy. If it isn't working out for you, try another therapist, but try to be open minded and give every solution they offer a fair shake. They only want the help you.

But please do try mindfulness meditation. I have never met somebody who has seriously tried it and not significant benefited from it. I can't make you do it but it is, in my opinion, the safest, most reliable and most productive way of helping you get your anxious thoughts under control."
"For a while, it seemed like nothing would ever get better in my life. And even now, things seem to sometimes get harder and harder, but I also realize I've gotten stronger with time, though it's been slowly and gradually so only when I look back, do I see it clearly.

I've been on and off medication for 7+ years. Struggling with depression, anxiety and other things including a diagnosis which makes sense to me now where I for years felt like there was something wrong with me. With the new therapy that deals with my diagnosis, I feel better and continuing to exercise, go out for a run in nature where I'm surrounded by trees has helped me SO MUCH. I make sure to get vitamin D and fish oil and other supplements because it's said to help against depression too.

I believe that when you continue to fight, things will get better and you will get stronger. Sometimes it can seem hopeless and sometimes things stand still, but you keep moving. I'm not taking this lightly, because for a while I had such anxiety I could not sit still, my heart would beat so fast in my chest, I felt like something bad was going to happen at every turn and it was so painful for a long time. But you have to keep going!
You are strong for fighting through this even when it seems like there's no point because things stay the same. I refuse to believe that it will continue that way if you keep going and try new things that could help against depression etc. Something's gotta give. But I don't take it lightly when you say it's constant suffering - because while I'm not that down right now, I do remember how painful it was while I was in that emotional hell."
"I think, especially when it comes to health, people do a lot of the “this worked for me/someone I know, so I’m sure this is what you need.” I see a lot more of it in mental health, but it’s there in other areas all the same. Most times, it’s well-intentioned, but it can also be a thing of affirming their own path. I saw that sort of thing in photo sales a lot, way back when: people would show up asking advice about a specific camera that, as it turned out, they had already purchased from a competitor. Sometimes, I was too honest for my own good, especially before I realized they had already bought it. 

For me, the biggest thing is knowing that people are there and that they’ll help with whatever I choose to pursue, treatment-wise, rather than insisting I try something specific. They can make recommendations, as I’ll readily admit that I don’t know everything, but when people get pushy or insistent or attach any sort of judgment to whether or not I do what they say, that’s when it becomes aggravating. Also, I’ve had people cut me off when I didn’t do what they said. That’s definitely no good. 

Patience is another huge thing. I have one local friend in particular who just checks in with me periodically, often a couple of times per week, and sometimes asks if I want to hang out, and is patient with me if I have to turn her down or cancel. I used to feel absolute crap about turning her down or canceling, but her sticking around and continuing to affirm that it’s OK if I’m not up for something has meant a lot to me. I still feel bad, but not as bad. 

I’m glad you found relief in therapy. A lot of us aren’t that fortunate. So, while encouraging the idea of going to therapy is great, leave it open to a person to not do it. 

I refused to go to therapy for a long time because of bad experiences, the social stigma, the programming that I needed to just “pull myself up by my bootstraps,” etc. Then, I didn’t go to therapy because I couldn’t manage to even schedule the appointments. So, maybe even offering to help with scheduling the appointments could be a thing? 

My most recent path to therapy was to finally get on Medicaid, then finally make an appointment with my GP, she set things in motion for me to meet with a psychiatrist, that psychiatrist, while I was there in his office for the appointment, phoned over to a local agency to set up my first talk therapy appointment. Once I had that first appointment, I was able to manage setting up subsequent appointments because my therapist blocked off a weekly slot for me. Now, I basically just have to get there. I don’t have to set anything up.

"TLDR- mass shootings are really hurting the narrative of people with mental disorders 

I researched and wrote a paper (for grad school) on mental health stigma and it’s effects on treatment seeking, which included this trend that you’re noticing and your observations are definitely backed up by lots of studies. Here’s some relevant chunks of my paper if you’re interested - 


There has been increasing mention of the need for mental health care in the United States. This seemed to be a promising development which would lead to good outcomes for those with mental disorders, but so far it may be doing as much damage as good. As you may have noticed, much of this public discussion over mental health care gets even louder in the wake of mass shootings. I think people have good intentions when they use mass shootings as an opportunity to discuss mental health and expanding mental health services as a way to prevent such horrible instances from happening again, but it comes at a price to the image of those with mental disorders. For people who are unfamiliar with mental health issues, only being exposed to people with mental disorders through mass shooters, whether the shooter actually had a mental disorder or not, gives off the impression that people with mental disorders are more dangerous than the rest of the population. This perception of dangerousness is not true, but the stigma towards people with mental disorder unfairly says otherwise. More people wish to distance themselves from people with mental disorders, which is not only hurtful on an emotional level, it is also financially detrimental since it hurts people’s ability to find employment and housing if they have a mental disorder. Adding stigma to a situation that is already challenging enough on its own can be enough to prevent people from being able to seek treatment, and keep in mind this is only one part of the battle for someone confronted with a mental disorder.......


.....The general population has learned more about what mental health issues are, but their views of people with mental illness have gotten worse (Schomerus et al. 2012). Across different industrialized developed countries, the general population has begun learning more about mental disorders. The general population is getting better at identifying the different types of mental disorders and have become more knowledgeable about different types of treatments including counseling and medication. There is also greater awareness that mental disorders are caused by biological factors. This knowledge has shown a reduction in blaming people for their disorders, but at the same time there has been an increased stereotype that people with depression and schizophrenia are frightening and a danger to others. The reported desire for social distance, or desire to minimize encounters with certain people, has particularly increased towards people with schizophrenia. People have increasingly reported that they would not want someone with schizophrenia as a co-worker or a neighbor. None of the countries included in the study showed an increase in acceptance towards people with any kind of mental disorder within the last decade....

I kinda suck as a writer but I’ve got pages of studies which back up a lot of what you’re saying here and it seems to be a trend going around the world. It’s something I’m going back to school to hopefully help fix. Sigh 
"
"&gt; Oh god yes. My entire family suffers with some sort of mental illness.

There you go.  This is very common.

"
"But my being worthless is nobody’s fault but my own. That isn’t mental illness, it’s realism. It’s honesty"
Did making amends with your family help you get through this? How did your family react? Thank you for your reply.
"Have you ever commited a crime that had caused pain such as: killing an animal/human, beating, rape, robbery etc? "
"Having a label makes everything make so much more sense. Good luck man, you're taking all the right steps! �� "
Having an emotional outlet can assist i in the prevention of PTSD. Just encourage her to complain about it often.
"Hello, he is recently turned 30 years old. He hasn't had any kind of psychological evaluation in the past, either."
I can listen bro.. it can help me a bit since we all have different reasons.. my situation was never like this...
I have already given up...my body just hasn't gotten the message and my mind won't let me end it. This is torture.
I know I just have like a lot and I feel weird just naming off all this stuff like they won’t believe me I guess
I needed this so bad. Thanks. I really could use one. I've been depressed for a while now and anything might help.
I personally would leave out Dr.google. just be honest about what youve been feeling and go from there! Good luck!
I would get some psychological testing done. It helped me a lot. I sound very similar to your daughter (18F btw).
If you text 741-741 you will be connected to a trained volunteer who can help talk you through whatever you need.
It's not a book but [check this website out.](https://thiswayup.org.au/how-do-you-feel/worried) It might help you.
"I’m so sorry you had to experience the horrors of a psych. stay.

"My particular Mania has been REALLY bad the past few days and I couldn't figure out why. I guess I know...

Hmmmm."
"My psychiatrist never prescribed me cymbalta. I've tried SSRI (escitalopram) last year, but it made me feel worse."
My sister's therapist said she was addicted to misery in just those terms.  Funny you described yourself that way.
Sounds like he needs some more training. I would report him to another teacher that you trust or to his superior.
"Thank you so much, it means so much. Just hopefully I get answers and I can do my best to carve a path for myself "
"Thank you, I'm just getting settled with it. I will always accept and pass this advice to others that want to help"
The stigma sucks. :( I’m sorry friend. Your diagnosis doesn’t determine whether you’re a good person or not.
"Yep, remember it's nothing to be ashamed about and it's best to talk to someone and not let it all get bottled up."
Yes and at the same time there's a disgust I feel about myself for not stepping up and the stupid excuses I invent
You all could choose to respect my boundaries but you never will. I'd rather die than have a long life of torture.
i seen one and they just told me it’s probably the side effects mixed with the anxiety but that was 2 days ago..
"&gt; Being trans is a very hard road. Coming to terms with it is by no means the hardest part.

I guess I knew how it is, I just wanted to reconfirm that there really is no way out. That's what hopelessness feels like. I just don't want to disappoint my parents and I'll try my best to lock the demons away until the very end.

&gt; I wish you the best of luck.

Thanks."
Are you ever able to spin the thoughts on their heads? For example witnessing death..could you turn that into being more grateful to be alive? It could be a habit of thought you can change by shift in perspective. If it’s compulsive and you find it impossible to stop then maybe some therapy would help? Do you have any help/support with your mental health currently?
"Currently it’s boxed up and being stored in my parents’ shed, and I plan on taking it all with me when I get an apartment in a few months. They always made me feel bad about taking up so much room with my boxes, which I think is one of the reasons why I still feel guilty. I also hate clutter, but I love my stuff, so I’m being pulled in two different directions. "
"I can't diagnose you, but do think you should look into the disorder. Educate yourself on it, and start looking for online or local help. My friend has been living with BDD and seeing her suffer was heartbreaking. She has been doing so much better since she started therapy and professionally operated support groups. You can definitely feel better if you work on it. 

"
"I have ocd too. I’ve had this obsession as well. The reason you keep thinking about it is because you consider it a “bad” thought. What you resist persists! It is normal to think about “horrible” things. It is not normal to act on them. Let them pass through your mind, don’t try to control them or judge them...then they will become less and less frequent. "
"I wish you much luck. I am starting therapy very soon (in the next few days to weeks) and I am scared as hell. Just try to relax (I KNOW hard to do!) and try your best to explain exactly what you're thinking, feeling, etc. Be as honest as you can. I just got put on the fast-track for therapy because they deemed me needing immediate help. I am sending you lots of hugs!"
"Life catches up to people dude and it might feel like you are going insane but you most likely are not, you just need a well deserved break from reality and go and see the better side of life, like another comment said, go and see the countryside and try to focus your mind on something better than this, good luck to you bro and just know my DM's are open for a chat :)"
"Like I said, they still have a kind of working class attitude and you can't blame them for that.  My parents were very job oriented as well.   Me, my sister and brother all had jobs pretty much within a few months after graduating high school.  That was how we were brought up.
 
You might have to rise above that without their help and break that inheritance yourself. "
"Maybe I should clarify that I’m not offended, and you don’t need rescuing. Reddit, or the internet as a whole, is very quick to get defensive - it’s bizarre to me when I’m sitting behind my screen chill as a cucumber. Please don’t preach to me, when I admitted that I don’t understand and thus can only assume. Which is why I asked, and cared enough to ask. "
"Oh sweetie. I hate when family does that. My mom used to make me feel like that all my life, and now I am seriously ""screwed up"" because of her lack of knowledge about and refusal to accept my mental health issues. Please know that I believe in you and I wish nothing but happiness for you. If you ever need someone to chat with, you can contact me. Lots of love to you!"
"Okay, but ask about ""the therapy"" seems vague. Do you mean that I should keep asking the therapist what would help me? I mean, how would I know if therapy is right for me? How long would it take? The uni. has stated that it's a short term thing and usually lasts less that 12 sessions. I think it's really small time frame to know whether a therapist is good for or not."
"People who self diagnose BPD are inaccurate more than any other self diagnosis. But if it is BPD, there's no easy fix, and you're going to make yourself miserable trying to handle it yourself. You definitely can't help if he doesn't want to be helped. You need to make sure you value your own happiness and well-being, and that you are with someone who values that too. "
"Tough love could also drive him away from you, which would be detrimental. When my suicidal ideations pop up to drag me down, somewhere in the back of my mind, i remember i am still needed by at least someone. He knows that you are his main support system. Make him feel like he is yours as well. Make him feel needed and loved without saying much, if that makes sence. "
"You are not a bad mom! You are a human being. A trip to target is not essential. 99% of the time thinking ‘am I a bad mum??’ Is a sign that you are anything but. Shitty parents don’t worry that they’re shitty parents. They don’t care. 
Take a breath. Try and cuddle your little one. They will get over it soon enough. Try again tomorrow if you feel up for it. "
"You’re too young to be formally diagnosed with a personality disorder. Also, only clinical psychologists or clinical psychologists in training should be diagnosing you. Psychiatrists with medical degrees are okay too. Don’t trust other therapists to properly diagnose. And even psychologists and psychiatrists get it wrong. Diagnoses are subjective and problematic. "
"it's quite odd how narcisism presents itself differently from person to person, for me it keeps me safe from hurting myself, wanting to succeed, so i'm always trying to become a better person and think positively, if i was on your cousin's place i would not only open the door but also project a fake overpositive personality on you even though i'm all fucked up inside."
"I hear you. Keep swimming, Friend. I'm sorry the water is so choppy &amp; frigid, but maybe you are even now on the cusp of something that brings you immense joy. Opportunity knocks very quietly sometimes &amp; there could be some little amazing experience just waiting for you to open the door. I understand that there are times when it may seem better to just close it forever but there is always potential. Always. I struggle through every day but I might someday have a positive effect on our world, so you could, too. Have a virtual hug &amp; chin up, buddy. You can overcome one minute at a time if that's what it takes!"
"I told my sister after the twat had gone home that's what she did was disrespectful and that since my dad would not put her out that I would be the one to do so and even call the police to have her removed from the premises, but all I received was flippant yeses that basically indicate to me ""Yeah, sure, whatever"". IF this friend is allowed in our home again which it's possible my father might not allow that particular friend to visit, but in case he doesn't take action (my father has a reputation of this) then I'm willing to throw the friend out despite consequences from any family that might disagree with my actions."
"I'm sorry you had this happen to you... no one should be abandoned with the sole reason being their mental health struggles.

However, I kinda feel like the answer might be very simple, but I'm just guessing. Seems to me like you tend to give your all to a relationship, which is not bad in itself, but it's only healthy to keep yourself in mind too - that being having healthier self esteem, self respect and practicing good self care. In the end, the qualities you neglect while in a relationship are a beautiful part of you that even your partner can value. 

I'm sorry if I'm off, hope it's at least some food for thought "
"It will get better. While my wife isn't dead, she left me two weeks ago, and I have a similar hole in my heart. I also suffer from depression, bipolar, PTSD, and lost my only grandparent this week. It has been so hard, and I still feel like I'm barely holding on, but I have been through tough times in the past, and it always gets better.

If you can, maybe talk to your pastor or priest. There are a lot of emotions that one deals with during the grieving process, and doing it alone is too hard. Find someone to help you through the process and navigate the emotions that you're feeling, and you will get through it better."
"That is another problem. I am extremely scared of doing/saying stuff I am not sure how could end

There is this girl I like. She has been my friend since I was 3 years old. I am about 80% sure she likes me back. She said she constantly thinks about the possibility of her liking me. But I won't do anything unless she says to me she actually likes me. I don't want to say something that might shaken my relationship with her



That also aplies to my parents. I don't want to scare them, so I need to be sure they will be comprehensible and not get to worried about me. But I know that is impossible so that is why I came here"
"You’d have the set of symptoms even if you didn’t have the diagnosis. The diagnosis just allows you to know how to help yourself in the right way, and allows others/ professionals to know how to help you too. It’s the same with a physical diagnosis. You’d still have diabetes &amp; all the symptoms even if you hadn’t been diagnosed right? It’s the same with mental illness. Don’t take this diagnosis as a curse, work with it. The treatment for bpd and depression is quite different (especially medication wise) so you’re on the right track. Things will be okay, and you’ll learn to manage your emotions xxx "
"true, good point mate!
Also, no evidence or explanation for this chemical imbalance. Yes its there, but does it cause the depression or or it a result of the depression? Scientist don't know. I'm sure our brains look different but was it like that anyway or because we have become depressed?... annoyingly difficult thing to find out! I think we often forget that mental health, especially anxiety and depression (coming from such natural emotions), is just as likely, if not more so, due toour life circumstances and a response to it and the way we think, rather than some genetic thing. Im sure it can be genetic too though "
"Ooh, I'm so glad you can relate! Well, not glad that you feel this way, cause it's often scary...but I'm glad to have someone who can relate to me.

Often, I feel like I'm not real either. I feel, when I think really hard about this ""theory"" of mine, that I may play a key role in the life of the main character (or at least one of them, if multiple). Kind of a ""main NPC"" if anything.

At my most ""blinded"" regarding this delusion of mine, I think there are times where the ""audience"" isn't listening/watching - and honestly, I prefer the times I think they *are*. 

Following that; Once when I was a kid, out of the blue I walked outside my house at night into pitch darkness, which wasn't typical of me to do. For some reason, the experience was terrifying - like going out of bounds in a game - and like I wasn't supposed to be there. Nothing visually scared me. I didn't see or hear anything that made me paranoid, but for some reason, I panicked and ran back inside, and suddenly everything was fine!

That's just some more rambles, though - my bad. I never really get the chance to talk about myself IRL :)

Thank you for replying!"
"If it’s any consolation I know exactly what you are feeling. I dealt with this all throughout my relationship but now sad to say I’m actually on the other side now. My relationship has ended and it had nothing to do with my anxiety, mood swings, fear, and it is strange the thing that ended it was something I never really saw coming. However, even though he wasn’t nearly as supportive as your boyfriend seems I was sooo afraid of losing him and had anxiety constantly thinking if we’d be broken up by Christmas etc. Realizing that one of my greatest fears came true I can honestly say it wasn’t all bad. This break up made me realize what I was giving up for someone who was not nearly into the relationship as I was. Lately all I have been thinking about is all of the new opportunities I have to travel and see the world. How I am not tied down, etc. My point is is that as I get older I realize that life is a journey and sometimes what could seem like the end of the world may actually not be as bad as we think. That is why I am seeing that having anxiety about any of was only tearing me apart. You will never be able to avoid,guess, or protect yourself from the future.You just have to fight those thoughts, work on thinking more positively, try being more in the moment. It’s not easy but it helps. Sorry to ramble hope my little two cents provides you with some comfort. "
"Some of the things you said there remind me of me a little bit. I’ve been having therapy for a while. I, like you, have never really been truly suicidal, but things are still difficult. I’ll tell you what I’ve discovered in case any of it resonates with you:

Unfulfilled goals/desires- I’ve had big dreams since I was little about life, career and relationships. Ive buried a lot of this. This makes me frustrated and angry and it spills out in all sorts of directions. 

Not speaking my truth- I say what I think often but don’t confess how I feel all that much. Done this for years without realising. 

Being hard on myself- I really beat up on myself for failures, flakiness and mistakes. Thinking angry/hateful thoughts toward yourself takes its toll, even if it’s just a thought like ‘I knew I was going to miss this train, god I’m such an idiot’. 

A combination of all these things can make me angry/snappy because there are things inside me that I haven’t expressed. So when people come to me and want my time or effort for something this voice inside wants to say ‘no! I’ve got more important things to worry about than that, why don’t you know this? You should know and understand me properly!’ . It’s irrational at times but that’s the feeling. 

Sorry to write an essay lol, I don’t know if any of this made sense but I felt compelled to share it."
"Yeah it seems from the literature that it's quite common in a general context to happen, to varying degrees, to people in a transient manner. Usually in childhood and often during fever. Once or twice type of thing. I've read that it's possible that about 30% of the population have experienced some form of AIWS like episode at least once. It's very close in nature to the delirium state.  


And yes, it's not nice to have it recur periodically out of the blue, when you're watching tv, playing the computer, reading a book or, more often than not, trying to fall asleep. I'm actually very relieved that you grow out of it. Before I found that out I've been going about with a palpable sense of apprehension about when it might next occur, though in a way I could never quite verbalize or conceptualize properly to myself. It has over the years become quite intrinsic to certain phobias I have about certain textural, audible or visual propertional relations between things. If people speak too quickly all of a sudden, or I touch something too thin, like a headphone wire, I get pangs of anxiety and for a moment feel a glimpse of it again, mistaking the sensation to be another onset.  


Luckily It hasn't actually happened now for a long time, barring a few minor particularly strong 'blips'. the most recent of which actually triggered me to go back to therapy. But that's another story!"

Get off of Seroquel.  It's a really shitty drug that will zombify you and that's even at the lowest possible dose.
Hmmm. I was under the impression that it was the opposite case. I guess I have to do more research than I thought.
I don't want to see a doctor or a psychiatrist because I don't want to go back on meds. But I do have a therapist.

Yeah I feel the same way at times too. That's why you need to take care of this right now before it gets any worse.
You too friend. :) Rest easy and I will talk to you soon if you need me. I am going to bed in a little while. &lt;3
paraphrasing is the best. I also use it sometimes to know that I understood the meaning of what someone said right.
"Antidepressants impact people differently. Not to mention the differences between individual drugs. Just because you don’t feel like he says he feels doesn’t mean they aren’t working. Also, “leagues better” is very subjective. For all you know he is having an experience similar to yours but in comparison to how he felt before it’s an incredible difference. "
"Don't waste energy worrying about getting worse.  That's just a cycle that feeds into itself.

&amp;#x200B;

You are in a better place than you were before.  You are better able to cope this time.  Just focus on one day at a time and you will never reach that day that it is all too much.  It's like they say, there is only one way to eat an elephant; one bite at a time."
"Have you ever discussed this with your doctor?  talking it out with a counsellor/therapist also might help. In regards to whether the problem is in your words ""real"" or ""fake"", I think whatever you feel is real to you and the doubt and confusion this is causing u are 100% real. Talking about it might help you as it can help you look a little deeper at what's going on. "
No need to be afraid! If anything they will help you cope and get through this. A lot of university’s also offer a low cost psychiatrist that you can go to. Your thoughts are obviously freaking you out. That’s why you posted here. It’s a really good first step that you reached out for help. But the next step is actually getting and accepting help. You can do this
"Psychiatrists are doctors, and mostly what they do these days is prescribe medications. They do not engage in talk therapy about feelings. 

However, what you describe sounds like someone who is not only rushing to get to what you want out of the appointment, but isn't willing to listen much to your concerns. I would at least make a report to the campus health center. "
"Started with Prozac, only because my sister recommended it.  She is fine on it but it turned me into Mr. Potato Head.  I switched to Effexor.  That worked for many years until it didn't.  I had to wean off and switch to something else.

I am now on a low dose of Zoloft.  Yeah, there are some side effects but the good outweighs the bad.

Yes, I see a therapist as well. "
"Well that's no fun.

I've been taking Busiprone for about 3 years now. I don't remember experiencing anything like that.

If I take it on an empty stomach I can get lightheaded.

It has helped me manage my anxiety, and I think I only upped the dose once in the last 3 years.

So I'd stick with it and if you aren't already try getting some food in you before you take it."
"Ya it sounds like you have some legitimate reasons for being depressed.  I would see a therapist. You should have no trepadations about therapists, they are here for you. A good therapist will understand that you have trouble opening up and help you to do so that shouldnt be a worry. Sometimes it takes time, but if you see someone you will almost definitely get better."
Yes I’m going through the same thing. Pretty much got prescribed Zoloft and it screws with my head literally. I have MDD and mild anxiety. I’m considering CBD oils heard a lot of the calming effects. I use to smoke marijuana and it helped me a lot. The person that commented about marijuana literally has no idea what they’re talking about. Don’t listen to them.
"I agree with the others. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this with a professional. If you could find a holistic, functional or integrative doctor-they would be in support of this choice more so than a conventional doctor. There are so many things that play in to our depression and anxiety such as the foods we eat (especially grains and sugar), if our hormones are balanced, if our thyroid is acting optimally, the chemicals we're breathing in every day...etc.... If you find a great doctor that supports those things they can help you with testing and coming up with a plan of action. I wish you the very best in your journey!"
"I'm not sure exactly why you are certain your career will need to change. With appropriate medication, hopefully you will find yourself to return to feeling productive and stable again. You went through some huge trauma, and given your family history it's not surprising that it unfortunately probably triggered a hereditary predisposition to come out.

Definitely start talking with your providers. Print out what you wrote and hand it to one of them, if needed. It's totally understandable to withhold these things, but hopefully you will find that laying it out on the table gives you the chance to feel the relief you need."
"No problem :) 

The original post is quite confusing and I’m rather uncertain of what the purpose is... furthermore... if someone is presented with THAT many “symptoms”, some of which, might I add, are diagnoses themselves... and the OP and the fiancé aren’t seeking professional help.... well they might ALL need professional help!!!! 

Sorry OP....  no offense to you or your friends... but mental illness IS VERY SERIOUS and it really sounds like your friend needs some professional help.... and perhaps you and the fiancé could benefit from some professional help as well to better cope with the issues presented!"
"Really sorry to hear about your treatment and situation. It reminds me in many ways of my own, years ago.

There's a good chance that you could be helped a great deal by therapy grounded in mindfulness practice. Mindful meditation is specifically designed to improve one's ability to notice and fully experience our environment, thoughts and feelings. 

It does take work and time. And as a warning, it can be painful, initially at first, to tackle emotions head on if one has been ""blunting"" them for a long time. You should do this with someone who has training and whom you trust. But the end results can be very worthwhile."
Thank you. I have always been an advocate for him. In school and otherwise. He is on an IEP and I am the one that usually asks the questions and comment when things sound like they aren't in his best interest. His mom does her best but I tend to notice things that she overlooks. We do hang out and play video games sometimes. He likes FPS games and I can't play them (I get motion sick &gt;\_&lt;) but we do hang out sometimes. We will have heart to hearts and I actually think he hears me. But then...then he does the opposite and I am like SMH. I can only keep trying my best and hopefully he is listening deep down inside.
"What steps you take is entirely up to you depending on how concerned you are for her safety.  Anything you do without her consent such as talking to her family or roommate or anyone else about this situation is likely going to put stress on your relationship.  It's up to you to decide if it's worth it depending on how serious of a danger you think she may be in as a result.


If you ever feel like she might be at risk to cause harm to herself or others as a result of this, I think that trumps any concerns over upsetting her.  You should inform her family and if possible you can call emergency services where she lives.  "
"I have received 40 treatments of TMS for depression. 5 times a week, 50 minutes a session to begin with. I didn't experience benefits (uplift in mood) until around treatment 30. Because it was so time intensive it was difficult to go to (be driven to) appts 30 minutes away from my house daily Monday-friday and still feel poorly. I was also frequently experiencing headaches due to the tapping, loud sound (I used earplugs during treatment), and pain from laying in the same position for 50 minutes (I can't really explain it but I am really stiff so when they initially positioned the chair it was uncomfortable but I didn't realize it would be..)

&amp;#x200B;

anyways, the full effects lasted for me for about a year. I was able to attend university and ultimately finish, with the help of some medications and therapy.

"Can completely relate, have about 8 half knitted projects on kneedles, x3 half complete crochet blankets &amp; an incomplete painting on the table. However I have completed a few projects this year &amp; I'm very proud of them. It took me a long time &amp; I flitted between them, started &amp; destroyed many projects in between but I persevered &amp; importantly I didn't beat myself up for not doing them.
Depression for me has a hideous ability to leech all the enjoyment out of the things I love doing, turn them into guilty &amp; feelings of 'why can't I finish this, I should be able to concentrate!' 

but as soon as you resolve to focus on what you enjoy about it &amp; understand that it's OK not to finish things straight away, you'll enjoy your hobbies more &amp; maybe even finish one or 2. Postpone it until you're in the mood to carry on... (Even if it's not for a month, or a year) you'll cycle back to it. 
Try to take the pressure off &amp; enjoy your creativity.  Some people respond better to setting timescales for when they'd want to complete a project, but when it's a hobby, I say do it when you're in the mood. :) "
"This is an interesting one, and I resonate with it at least partially. Not for the exact same reasons but with the overarching theme. As one man to another who struggles with self love, it's hard. Especially if your own brain chemicals are fighting against you. 
Figuring out how to love yourself as a man is also difficult, both within the confines of how we view masculinity and how you express yours. It turns out, the more cofident you are in yours the better people see you. Even if your version of masculinity isn't traditional. 
Excersise helps, you don't have to go balls to the wall at first, it's about how often you do it vs how hard. Anti depressants wont help you love yourself, but they will motivate you to do things that make you love yourself. If it's not something you're averse to, mushrooms a few times a year CAN go a long way to helping. 

It hurts to see a young man go through many of the things I did/do. I'm not saying I may not still kill myself one day, but it does get better. It also gets more complicated. You can PM me if you want someone just slightly older to talk to who has an idea of what's up. 
(M 23)"
"Typically, the only way I handle it is by being too afraid of both failure and success to go through with it. This may be because I don't hear a voice telling me to do it and I don't have particular concerns about how it'll affect anyone else.

For me they're conscious thoughts, which I find real scary. I find it stems from this line of thoughts: ---&gt; I don't feel anything other than negative emotions ----&gt; I also feel detached from everything ---&gt; this is a pitiful existence and I have no reason to put up with it ----&gt; ah, I really wish I would just end it.

Otherwise, I sort of will myself into a state of cognitive dissonance. I know that my negative thoughts may well be delusional. I also know that depression causes emotional and cognitive stagnation. I use that small piece of knowledge to will myself into believing, at least on the basis of probability, that there is the faintest hope my life won't always be like this. I end up believing a complete paradox: that my life will get better and worse. I call it Schrodinger's Lifeline, for in my mind both are happening at the exact same time; it is only once I've taken the step into the future that I will reveal to myself which one I may bring about. It doesn't make me feel better, but it prevents me from going through with the ideas of any thoughts I might have.

I dunno. Hope that's at all useful.

"Thanks for your input. I am conscious of all of the concerns you've raised. Despite the working relationship, we're pretty good friends. We were friends from the get-go. I'm not meddling in her life, I'm leveraging my strength to help a friend. I don't think I'm mistaking any of her social signals, either. I believe I know her well enough to be able to parse when she's uncomfortable. She expressed her thanks to me a couple of times during the night, and talked positively about the interaction with another co-worker who commented about it later. I'm also half her age. We're a couple of women with a lot in common who enjoy each other's conversation. And, again, I can tell she wasn't uncomfortable because I listened to her speak and stayed alert for cues that I may be making her uncomfortable. 

I know that she felt that way because she told me she did. I am not guessing what she's thinking, I am listening to what she says and helping her see an emerging pattern. Imposterism is incredibly common. I prompted her several times to let me know if it just didn't sound right (ideas like that are tools, and we throw out tools that don't work) and she confirmed again and again that this rang true for her and she was grateful for my help identifying the problem.

I think you're reading ill or dysfunctional intentions into this situation where there are none. My intentions are to gain some understanding for myself and to gather some resources for her to persue if she chooses. I'm not micro-managing her at all, and she was as engaged in the conversation last night as I was. As I said, it has been weeks since we worked together so there was much to talk about, anyway.  We are, again, pretty good friends. 

You said I should not read into the mind of another adult, but you've just made a whole bunch of uncharitable assumptions based on a totally inaccurate view of the situation I've presented. I see that you are trying to draw from your own experiences, and I'm sorry that those experiences were negative for you, but perhaps you should consider that you're projecting a lot of negative emotions through your response that just do not exist IRL."

Extreme random happiness out of nowhere can be a warning sign of suicide. The happiness might come from him knowing that he's going to end it.

If they wanna see a therapist, maybe offer to drive them to the first appointment, or offer to call some places they wanna check out for therapy. Ask if they need help getting groceries and go with them. The point is to help them feel more accomplished by doing small tasks like grocery shopping or organizing their room. Ask them what they would like to get help with and if they wanna be left alone they can ask for it. Ask if you can check in after a certain amount of time, maybe a text like ""hey i am here if you want to talk"". You are doing a great job of asking for tips and wanting to help this person. They are very lucky to have you in their life"
"Vent away!!! Please do! 
I know this feeling so well. You sound like you DO need anxiety meds. They would at least take the edge off of the panicky feeling you have. I hated that feeling so much when I was in the Psych Hospital. I kept thinking that I would NEVER get out of there and never be able to cope while there. After a whole 2 days or so of panic, they gave me Clonidine, which helped IMMENSELY. I was able to focus on the groups and I even made friends while there. We would color and listen to music and just chat, and from then on, the rest of the week had flown by me. The next thing I knew, the Psychiatrist was telling me I was being discharged. I felt sad to be leaving, to be honest. Can you at least try to get involved with your peers at all? Go to the library or if they have a cafe for the students (the college our daughter goes to has a place called Gracie's and that is where all the kids meet up and hang out) or take a walk? Sorry if these don't help, but that is all I can think of. 

I hope you can get something for your anxiety soon. I still take Clonidine to this day (1 mg once a day) and it helps not only with my anxiety, but also my...firesetting behaviors. Heh. The only bad thing is that is makes me sleepy so I take it at night. Maybe you can ask about getting something. I hope you do. Take care. Message me if you are feeling lonely. I will talk to you. :)"
"(1) Self confidence is more than just acting like you’re secure in yourself. Learn to trust your gut, your inner voice.
- Maybe you feel needy because perhaps you rely on others to judge you, rather than judging yourself from within. You might have an idea of who you are, but you can’t trust it until someone else agrees with you. Learn to let that need go. Trust your own judgement. 


(2) Your self worth should not depend on how well liked you are. If you face a situation where you aren’t sure if you’re “being selfish” or being smart - think objectively at what good it brings into your life vs. how much it does damage. Weigh whether what it brings to you is worth the damage. 
- You cannot be there for someone else if you aren’t there for yourself first. If another person dares call you selfish, they aren’t someone you need to keep around. 


(3) When it comes to insecurities/fears, play the tape through, and you’ll start to see that the things you fear may not be so scary.
- You’re worried you might be the annoying one. Worst case scenario: you are annoying. What does that mean for you? Does that mean you are a bad person? Do you lie, cheat, steal, do malicious things to hurt others? If not, what’s to worry about? 
- You worry your friends talk about you behind your back. Again, if you are not a “bad person,” what does it matter if they do talk about you? If you’ve done nothing to hurt them, their bad mouthing you is more a reflection of their character than yours. 
- You cannot control what other people do or say. Focus on what you can control - who you surround yourself with and how you behave. "
"Hello thanks for responding!

&gt;**What effect has this had on his relationships with GFs?**

​

He has in the past been very unsuccessful in maintaining relationships until this year. This year however, he has found his first girlfriend and while we're all very happy for him he has been acting very strangely

For example he is very protective and for months would not let us see her. This is understandable in relationships as you don't want to make things too serious and scare the other person off but seemed strange given that he has already visited her family on many occasions. We only got to meet her once when by complete accident they bumped into us during a meal. The chances of that happening were extremely low and he had turned off his phone so we couldn't message him if he would like to join in. When we met he introduced her and she seemed nice and got along with everybody really well. I think everybody was confused why he was so secretive.

Another example of the aforementioned is when my dad happened to sit opposite of her on the train purely by coincidence. He was furious.

More examples include that he gets very defensive and snappy if you talk about relationships with him and quickly changes the topic, and arranges dates in such a way that we cannot see or say hello to her. If he is being picked up by his girlfriend he will get picked up out of view of the house, behind a bush, etc. It has made us wonder if perhaps he is ashamed of us or fears that we might judge him / scare away his girlfriend if we were to get to know each other more.

&gt;**This is concerning behavior for a family member who shows ""no sign of any kind of anger"" and ""normally loves meetups.""**

Yes this has worried us. We all love him and up until his 30th birthday he was extremely social and would always spend time with us or invite us out. Our nieces love him so much and would usually see him several times a week but haven't seen him now in many months. Every year around this time him and I have a walk along the cliffs. It's sort of a tradition of ours -but he hasn't suggested, or mentioned the idea of it this entire year which is extremely weird.

&gt;**Are you sure about the ""no sign of any kind of anger""?  I ask because  you say that, during adolescence, he sometimes became violent with you.   Has that lack of emotional control -- which is common in teenagers --  continued into his adulthood?**

You can usually tell that he is angry with you because he will either state it outright or give you the cold shoulder. Sometimes saying few words in the course of a few days but talking fine with other people. If he was angry with us we would be able to tell because he wouldn't talk with us at all, but right now he is living with us and is really friendly during normal conversation.

Just to add that the first instance of his violence has been since about 25 years. As a teenager he was always playful and gentle. Would never even dream of hurting an insect and would most likely scold me if I were to do something violent myself.

&gt;**Murkey, you are not describing autism symptoms here.  I've never heard  of an autistic person who has ""great social skills"" and ""no trouble  making friends or striking conversations with complete and total  strangers.""**

Apologies, I only bring this up because he has been this way since a toddler. Autism isn't the right word here.

Since the entire time I have known him he has been clumsy and has done dangerous things while being seemingly oblivious to the immediate danger that he puts himself and others in. Examples would include nearly burning down  the house / suffocating the family, and attempting his own ""freestyle parkour"". He has always acted in ways that lack common sense or logic and often involve convoluted solutions to problems he invents. This might include putting cups of water around the house in random locations to make the air more humid, or leaving rubbish in the garden to get rid of flies.

If it is indeed a developmental condition it might explain why he has always had these traits and never grew out of them, or if like you suggested it is a personality disorder then that might explain the possible attachment issues he has.

Either way thank you for your time.

PS:

I would also like to add that I feel really bad for saying all of this. Part of me is aware that it is my brother's decision to live as he wants. I do feel guilty for bringing this up but recently his behavior has become so obvious and out of place. It has distanced him from the entire family I think to the point that we can't avoid talking about it. We all made a decision together that we wouldn't talk about my brother behind his back as that was something that mum would do and that doing so would also give him actual reason to avoid us. We are not an entitled family and really respect each other's personal space but just he has been acting so abnormally recently that it is starting to concern us."
I think your facts are slightly off. 50% of your population will not have a mental disorder. I think more around 20%

"Already planning on seeing my GP, but they're on vacation currently.

Doesn't hurt to ask random strangers online. (:"
Have you told him about these fears? Maybe he'd be more intentional about checking in if he knew he was hurting you.
I did the same thing! I liked my student counselor more than any therapists I’ve had in the past. Highly recommend
I do. It’s hard. And it’s a main reason I procrastinate. My anxiety just ensures it always gets done eventually.
I don't think you can if that's not what he wants.  I'd focus on protecting yourself and your child from this person.
"I generally avoid taking selfies, I know what I look like, what's the point in taking hundreds of pictures of myself?"

"If a parent abused their child, they deserve to be told it was their fault. There's no reason to forgive such people."

"It could have some OCD elements as well. But it happens when I'm around others, whether friends, family or strangers."
"It will get better. Message if you want to chat. Remember to feed yourself good food, sleep, shower, and take a walk."

It’s lower than that. The heritability rate for schizophrenia among second degree relatives is approximately 2-4%.

Maybe write in a journal or keep a mood log so you can show your therapist/doctor the suffering you are experiencing?

"Same here. However, they really need a better system for those who can’t use their site (due to being too severe). "
Stop wasting people's time on a sub that's supposed to help people with *real* problems. It's shameful and immature.
Thank you for your kind words! Your comment really helped me shift my perspective on depression. Thank you for that.

"&gt;  I do not currently have any kind of access to mental health facilities unless I pay exorbitant fees that I simply cannot afford. 

Try ""talkspace"" I haven't tried it but saw ads for it on Facebook it's much cheaper and you get to talk to licensed counselors online. You need therapy, a counselor helps a lot find your way out of the maze.

"Even then depression and anxiety is really generalised e.g. having depression is just narrowed into being that guy who is lethargic and can't get out of bed and wants to commit suicide. Just have to stay patient and instead of getting angry at people for not knowing, it's better to try and explain. I myself am still trying to figure out/get a diagnosis for what I 'have'."
"I can offer lots of hugs. Having a mental illness isn't the worst thing. Hell, I have several diagnosed and one that has yet to be diagnosed, and it is OK. You might want to talk to your family doctor first and see what he thinks you should do. He might tell you to talk to a psychiatrist, who can diagnose you or ease your mind. Good luck and I hope you feel better. &lt;3"
"I can't stand either, have to disable it somehow. And seems like a lot of people are being sponsored by them, which makes me question them a lot... Maybe it's because if something has to be so intensely advertised and bragged about by paying people and sites to post, then chances are isn't worth it, but that's my rule. Plus the ad itself its so cheesy and not appropriate"
"I know what you're saying. But I have tried to contact them on new social medias, I saw them in the street a little while ago and they completely ignored me.

Their families still talk to me, and a lot of people who I thought would know what happened have been surprised to find out I'm no longer friends with the old group anymore. They just cut me out with no hesitation."
"I saw that a “Psychologist” commented on here but has since deleted her post, stating that fluoxetine is an antidepressant, not an anti-anxiety medication and that “you can’t compare apples to oranges”.

The OP is on Sertraline, which is an SSRI, therefore my post is completely relevant. This is why people should read posts in their entirety before commenting! "
"It's a disorder characterized by intense and frequent mood swings, fear of abandonment, difficulty controlling impulsive behaviours, chronic feelings of emptiness, and short-term breaks with reality via dissociative, paranoid, and/or psychotic episodes. Generally it is a result of childhood trauma or abuse along with inherited vulnerability (it tends to run in families)."
"Ive been exercising lately,and i kinda want to lose weight. I guess i can do it.

Ive been doing it,and i havent felt mentally magically better.

Right now, i want to stop using internet and stop playing video games. Ive wasted time on these things. I want something new.
I want to be happy,and smile. And spread a smile on other peoples faces.

And i dont believe in god. "
"Just explain all that to them. I can't guarantee that they will release you, but if they think you are a danger to yourself or others, they just might keep you there until a full eval can be done. Most times, in my experience, if you explain that it wasn't a suicide attempt and you have no plans to hurt yourself, you should be OK and hopefully released. Good luck to you!"
"The thing is that I know that I have some undiagnosed issues but I've been dismissing them to the point that I can't really recall with clarity all those stuff. It's like a big issue in itself :/.

"Thinking about dying or thinking of the actions you'd take to kill yourself? There's a big difference. The brain often thinks of death and runs imaginary simulations to prepare itself, as that's its main goal: survival. It'll imagine us jumping in front of a moving car or train etc. Now, if you're thinking of taking action or harming yourself, then definitely seek help. "
"Well done! It's so hard reaching out, you're courageous af.

Honestly is the best advice I have. Imagine you took your car to a mechanic but didn't let him see the engine, tell him what had happened to the car, or lied about what the car was doing every day. Remember the mechanic is on your side. Leaving things out isn't lying but will harm your progress just the same ;)"
"When you are dealing with depression and anxiety, your assignment of yourself as ""lazy"" is not making anything better. You aren't lazy, you are struggling with a mental health issue. And when you call yourself ""lazy"" it's not to motivate, it's to tear down. It is the same as every other bad name you call yourself. (paraphrased from a therapist I work with).

&amp;#x200B;"
"I disagree. I know you’re trying to help, and I’m taking in everything you’re saying. Our situation was never perfect, but we always were. We always had each other’s back and brought out the best in each other until recently when it’s almost like she switched off a switch.
 I believe that people are inherently good, and I’ve gotta believe that she’s not evil enough to cheat of me. 

And it’s been three days man. At this point I still gotta have some hope that she realises what she's giving up and fixes it. This is my way of coming to terms that it's probably not gonna happen, but what is life without hope?"
"I'm already dx with pyromania d'oh. I start fires but they are all small controlled fires. I have enough common sense to know if it isn't safe then its a no-go and I end up pushing those urges back down.

I feel so hopeless...nobody in real life I can tell (I am still on a waiting list for a T) and I don't see my Psych for 2 more weeks ughhhhh. I had those fantasies again just 10 minutes ago. Saw cars on fire. This is what happens when I can't burn something...it comes out whether I want it to or not. 

Google Pyromania if you want an interesting read. I started crying when I was told that's What is inside my mind...sigh."
"If you need some good techniques for agoraphobia, the best one I was ever taught was this - as you venture out of your house, take stock of everything around you. Most people with agoraphobia do this naturally, as it's part of the hypervigilance and anxiety. Then ask yourself, ""what here is going to hurt me?"" The answer is usually nothing, and if you actually can identify something harmful, you can safety plan around it. By going through it step by step, it takes the power away from the unknown. 

While waiting for therapy, there's some good online-based counseling services that are not very expensive and can help a lot. "
"Mild auditory hallucinations like the ones you describe are fairly common in individuals with very high anxiety and/or have a history of one or more traumatic experiences.  It's rarely an indicator of a psychotic disorder.  

If you were to start to regularly hear voices or other strange occurrences you should be concerned and get checked.


All in all, the fact that you experience this is probably an indicator of a very high level of anxiety regardless of the cause.  If you want to be a police officer it's probably something you should work on with a therapist to get a good handle on before going through your training.  "
"See if your doctor offers genetic testing for medications. Basically it swaps the inside of your mouth and looks at how your body will metabolism different medications. I did it and come to found out the medication I was on wasn’t going to work for me because my body didn’t break it down properly. Besides that, it takes a few weeks to notice a difference. I never feel like mine is working until I forget to take it for a day or two and notice a big difference. Zoloft is in the SSRI class of medication too which is on the lower end of anti depressants, but unfortunately that’s where insurance companies make DR start. "
"Unfortunately my partner also suffers from mental illness so it's hard to discuss much of anything unless he's having a good day. Honestly, in the state him and I are in its not a great relationship but I know once we both get ourselfs figured out we will be like we used to be years ago, happy and content. I'm a bit isolated, I don't go out much because it becomes too much for me and my partner works 45+ hours a week so I'm alone most of the time. I try to surround myself with people but I don't really have anyone. I recently got a pet rat to try and motivate me a bit, it at least gets me out of bed to feed him everyday. "
"When you compare what a ""bad day"" is to someone who doesn't suffer from depression, it gets frustrating. Therapy is amazing if you connect whether it be group or solo therapy. Skipping it is common, I often skipped because I was angry, and tires of waking up and just not being able to move because of my thoughts. There are a ton of coping mechanisms, as long as you voice yourself, it begins the self love process. I believe in you, the struggle will never cease. Self medication via drugs, food, therapy etc. are often misused. Value yourself and the decisions you make to improve your day to day mental battle. Did this help?"
"You think OP is dealing with someone who ranges between careless and demeaning, to actively abusive... And your plan is to antagonize this person? Good luck with that! If that's the kind of person he is, it will not be effective and will only worsen the situation. If that's not the kind of person he is, it will not be effective and will only worsen the situation. 

I mean... Realistically, your advice is no help at all. OP came here looking for a solution, I'm pretty sure she's aware that leaving him is an option. The only alternative is communication or couples therapy. Your advice is useless to anyone in any situation. "
"Try to understand that they are likely trying to help you. Maybe they are being tactless or insensitive but they have good intentions.

Once you've accepted that, talk to them and tell them about the progress you felt you were making. They can't read your mind so, from the outside, it may have looked like you were in a rut. Tell them what steps you had made and how they made you feel by putting pressure on you, and that the result was that you took a step backwards.

I'm trying not to blindly jump to your parents' defense here because parents can be dicks as much as the next guy, but if you're not communicating with them then they won't have anything to go on, and they'll keep repeating the same pattern. Just be honest and open with them without attacking them and trust them to respond in kind. If they don't then come back and tell us and we'll try to help you work it out."
"Some people romanticise it for sure. It’s an important part of their identity. For me, when I was depressed, chronically anxious and going through trauma, I did all I could to hide it and I rarely and selectively spoke about anything if anyone asked. Close friends and family could tell I wasn’t ok sometimes. I just didn’t want it to define me. I didn’t want anyone to perceive it in me, not even my insomnia. I wanted to be functional so I never got any help for it, I couldn’t bear to recount everything that got me feeling so awful. Most people had no idea I was mentally ill fir years and I preferred it that way. Thankfully I’m better these days, thanks to CBD oil, after years of suffering. There’s a lot of people like me who no one would ever suspect that they’re suffering pretty badly with depression, anxiety, trauma, etc. Now I’m very protective of my mental health because I never want to go through that shit again. It never felt to me like my mental health problems were there for me through times where no one else was there. I thoroughly enjoy my own company, but it was not fun when I was mentally unwell"
"Poor sleep makes you gain weight. Are you diabetic? I am. Anything with Metformin promotes weight gain.
I had dangerously low testosterone. Was taking pills until I was switched to injections to protect the liver. Guess what? Even testosterone injections can cause weight gain. I was 335 until I got sick from Fentanyl and went down to 192. Quit that. Went back up to 300. Got healthier. Now I am at 254 and still losing. I was told by Endocrinologist that my belly fat acts like a giant endocrine gland. It sends signals to the pituitary gland that changes your body chemistry. Your body's reaction to testosterone is to convert it into estrogen, which increases belly fat. It's a vicious cycle.
Besides a few medication changes and tweaks, the biggest change I made that improved my health and allowed me to lose weight was improved sleep.
I got a CPAP machine and use it religiously. I take pain meds and Ritalin. My thyroid was off so I got meds for that. I monitor my blood sugar and BP 3 times a day.
I still have sleepless nights but I am on a disability pension and that allows me to catch up on sleep. I also work part-time.
This all has taught me to cover ALL my bases and that my moods, motivation levels, anxiety, depression and all my physical problems were interconnected.
You have to take a whole-health approach and don't give up mak8ng changes. It's much like playing whack-a-mole"

he really goes deep and talks about what worked for him, get the audiobook version, he reads it, you can get first one free on audible then cancel after, think you will relate and for me thats gold to find someone else who shares my story

*A revealing, raw, funny, and heartfelt memoir from one of Australia's most well-known and well-liked celebrities. But while everything looks great from the outside, the real picture has not always been quite so rosy. Osher has always known he's different to most other people. Struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, and weight issues since he was young, he tried for years to drink away the anxiety and depression. He ended up unemployed, divorced, suicidal, and certifiable on the other side of the world, yet somehow he managed to put the broken pieces of his mind back together and make a life for himself again. He lives with a mental illness - and he's come to terms with it to live an authentic, rich, and fulfilling life.*"
"Firstly, just want to say: what you've done for that family has not gone unnoticed. I can promise you that your son appreciates and LOVES you for everything you have done, and sees how much you have put into the family. This isn't your fault, and sometimes, we find out too late when a loved one is suicidal...you've done your best as a father.

I think you're right in assessing that this is more about his past than anything. This might be the rock bottom he needs to hit in order to get the right type of support. There's nothing more vulnerable than being caught during a suicide attempt and depending on how this situation is handled, he might learn to be more open to healthcare/social service providers. Make sure you advocate for him if you notice he's not getting the support he needs. The healthcare system is crappy sometimes when it comes to mental health

I noticed that you said ""how can i get him to realize that his life is important?"" and to that, i would say - you simply can't. this is his battle to fight. He has to realize it himself; and you can't carry that responsibility on your shoulders. You can't walk him through his own trauma/whatever it is that effecting him. 

The most important thing for you to continue doing is to stand by his side, and to leave the door open, and to continue giving him love. Maybe ask him how he would like you to help &amp; just check-in with him time to time. And if he doesn't like talking about his feelings with you, ask him whether there's any activities you guys can do (like sports, video games, cooking food) etc for stress relief/bonding that are less intimidating to take part in (vs heart to heart conversations)

edit: Also! Continue role modeling. He's probably used to chaotic relationships, so by staying in his life, you're just showing him that it's possible to simultaneously love someone without hurting them. Keep on doing you &lt;3"

What I usually do to avoid the thoughts is play a really boring game on my phone like solitaire or Sudoku, or some coloring type app. It tires my brain out to the point where I pretty much fall asleep before I have time to really think about that stuff. hope this helps xx"
"I don't necessarily disagree with going to the police. It's forcing some bodies hand that I disagree with, we don't know all the facts of the situation. That could be the best course, or it could be calamitous. If the person who says it is also serious, it removes the power of the parent to make the decision, who also knows more about what is going on than any of us here."
I would start taking it if prescribed. Its one of those things that you won’t know if it works for you until you’ve tried. I know a few people who ecitelopram works really well for but then I myself tried it and it didn’t really work for me. Biggest warning with these medications I’d suggest is avoid alcohol while taking it as it will likely make you pretty sick.
"If it's ingrained deep, push that shovel down a little further and dig that shit out. Live for yourself. I started my YouTube Channel as a way of forcing myself into doing something i'm not 100% comfortable with. I just had a feeling others could relate to me so I decided, if I can't meet people like me in real life, I'll find them online...which is also why i'm here. :-)"
"If what you’re looking for here is a diagnosis, you will not get one. Not from me at least. 

But if what you’re asking is if all these things you’ve mentioned points to some sort of medical or mental health issues, then yes you’re on the right track. I know because everything you’ve mentioned is/was me. 

She’s your close friend, why don’t you talk to her. "
"If you over-spend your money and start too many projects when you are feeling 'on top of the world' this could be bi-polar.  If you function well when you are feeling good and don't run into those kinds of problems, then it's probably just occasional depression.

I agree with what others have said and think seeing a therapist would be in order.

"It appears that the program the survey is on, Qualtrics, is set up in a way that it doesn't allow people to come back because it wants to make sure people don't submit multiple responses. But, unfortunately, the draw back is that people who are working on it and leave also lose their responses. I'm really sorry that happened and we have submitted to Qualtrics that issue. "
"No actually it's when I've gotten to know them via the group chat or personally and they turn out to not have the problem officially diagnosed or even on the medication they said they were on so. If I am interested in chatting with someone or am concerned for their welfare I will look through their other recent posts. Even if that is weird, isn't certainly not weirder :) "
"We know more about the sky than our oceans. I can tell you the sky is a relatively simple thing when comparing to the complexities of the surface of the earth. It operates only on four fundemental forces that are very basic and have existed since the beginning of time itself.

Perhaps it's the abyss itself that makes you so terrified. Infinity it's self can be terrifying."
"Yeah, I find that if I don't maintain a more stable baseline of self-care (which is embarrassingly hard sometimes) it's a lot more difficult to get off the ride once it starts moving.

I hope journaling helps! If you're creative, you could make it a visual journal too. I like writing out my feelings, but capturing them in images is rewarding in its own way."
"3 days for 50% of the medication to be eliminated. The effects themselves can take some time depending on how long you have been on the medication, if you have been on it 1 days then by day 4 or 5 you should be okay, if you have been on it for months then it can take months for your body to readjust.  There are a lot of factors involved, length of time on medication, a persons bodily chemistry etc.

From your description it sounds like your serotonin was elevated too high, you shouldn't have a rapid heart beat. Are you sure you didn't take anything else that might increase serotonin, alcohol, medication or a herbal remedy?"
"It looks like you're recognizing it as abuse, which is good because that's exactly what it is.

Call her bluff and call 911 the next time she threatens.  And the time after that.  And the time after that.  After enough involuntary holds (3-4, maybe? just a number plucked from thin air), maybe her pattern-recognition software will kick in and she'll stop making these empty threats to you.  And if she keeps up the threats regardless, maybe you just block her number.  

She is responsible for what she does to herself.  Remember that.  No matter how much she'll try to blame you for her actions, *she* decides what *she* does.  "
"Yeah, it's tough. It feels like there's a lot of sharing of crises, hurt feelings, shame and guilt of repeating of poor behaviour due to core wounds (even though there's a sense of awareness) and general not-so-positive posts going on in the BPD sub. And while there's a lot of empathy between users, it can be really disheartening. 

I've personally found that I also identify strongly with the CPTSD subreddit, and find the users there overall more positive and likely to be ""proactive"" in a sense. More posts that have a point beyond being a bit of a scream chamber. More likely to recommend things to read, techniques to try. "
"I think what you see as being too trusting may be you having poor boundaries and being unable to recognize and protect yourself from others' harmful behavior. When a person is raised in an abusive/neglectful situation, it is common for them to have been told that things that are abnormal and abusive are normal and okay. Often they can also be a victim of gaslighting. 

These kinds of situations can warp a person's sense of what kind of behavior is acceptable. Basically, they lose their ability to see ""red flags"" in others. Narcissists, abusers and personality disordered individuals can be very drawn to this kind of permissive person because they are easy to manipulate and often lack the skills they need to protect themselves. Please talk to your therapist about strengthening your boundaries and improving your ability to recognize inappropriate behavior in others. Good luck!"
"She is an adult therefore her mother has no say in her treatment.  Her mother does not need to know.  If she does any treatment, her treatment team would not be allowed to disclose any information to her mother UNLESS your gf signs a release for her mother.  If her mother were to call a place and demand to know if and what services your gf is engaged in, legally they cannot confirm nor deny that she is a patient there.   
Most major universities have a mental health program for students but depending on the severity of a clients illness they may not be experienced/equipped to treat someone with a severe illness.  Usually, universities have masters level students as counselors.  

She could benefit from DBT therapy and an evaluation.  
Also, this is information based on assuming you are based in the US. If outside the US, I don't know what the mental health system is like.  "
"You are not your depression. Your depression does not define your morality for you. Depression is a part of you, but not one that should be listened to. 
With any other disease, like diabetes, the insulin doesnt define your life, it helps you live your best life. 
I really like Dialectical Behavioral Therapy because it helps you practice actions to counter these harmful thoughts and routines that manifest themselves. Practicing nonjudgemntal stance helps change the way you talk to yourself, especially around thoughts of "" I'm bad.""
That's just been my experience as a chronic ruminate and over thinker. I am still working on my patience and not automatically going into negative self talk. It gets better with practice and the right medication, but depression is self aware and tries to make itself the dominate voice. 
Love yourself enough to hear what the good in you has to say"
"Hi, I struggle with anxiety and chronic depressive disorder and much like your boyfriend, am chronically tired despite eating super clean, getting 1+ hours of exercise a day, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, sleeping 6-8 hours a night and generally living pretty dang healthily (save for, you know, the mental health part). I do all this because after taking meds for a couple years during and after college, I have decided to live my life unmedicated. Not sure if your boyfriend is medicated or not, but unfortunately the chronic fatigue is something I have found doesn't really go way. If he is open to it, he could try a sleep aid if he speaks with his doctor. There were times in college I would be in bed 10-12 hours at a time but only really get restful sleep for 2-4 hours a day. Once I started medicating, I could sleep and be fully rested on 6-7 hours and my ability to focus and stay awake during the day went up like crazy. Also, if you live in a state where weed is legal, you can try topical or edible products with CBD to get a deep sleep. I do this when I feel myself creeping into sleep deprivation land and it helps 8/10 times."
"Thank you. This is really hard to deal with since nobody understands it. I went to another Psych in the same office as mine (I Just needed to talk to someone!) and when I told him I start fires on purpose, I enjoy doing this, and I don't want to stop doing it, he looked at me like I grew 2 new heads. He didn't understand it at all...he had NOTHING to offer me (in the way of advice/support) and all he told me is to see a Therapist and to see my regular Psych. Great. That REALLY helped the urge to burn that idiot's office to the ground. I would NEVER do it (because I wouldn't hurt the other professionals and patients in that building and I don't fancy going to jail EVER) but dang if I didn't want to light a fire right there to prove I.am.not.faking.this. That is the consensus with someone my age (I am in my late 40s)...I am doing this to either A) get attention (Nobody but ONE person knows about this) or B) to amuse myself and to test out another mental illness (yeah like I SO enjoy being mentally ill ya know...) Well sorry for the long reply. It bugs me that I can't talk to anyone about this. I don't want my Psych to know. :("
"ADHD-PI, Aspergers and some features of anxiety disorder. Yes I do feel like I’m a very messed up person quite often."
Can't talk about mental illness unless there is a body count. Seems to be the only thing that stirs up the newsophiles.

Focusing on a task helps me. I do word searches to keep my mind off of what is causing the attacks or to take a break.
"How about the British asking ""Alright""? and the accepted reply is also ""alright"". Pretty much the same across the pond."
How was your mood when you stopped taking meds? The only moment I expect to stop the drugs is if I try to be pregnant..
I am on it.  You might feel a little weird for the first few weeks.  Its normal.  Try withholding judgment for awhile.
"I haven't been to a doctor since I was 15 so I'm quite nervous, I might write everything I need to say down before i go"
I meant do they check. I am always super worried about my records in some way shape or form effecting me down the line.
I understand that it's hard to control. But you've got to stop doing it. You need to find healthy ways to cope instead.
I'm 30 and still struggle with this. I try to remind myself that everyone else could be worrying about the same thing.
If you do Etsy both get (or make your own) duvet cover and buy from someone close if possible cause shipping is horrid.
"If you keep your body colder rather than warmer it helps. When I go through these periods, I sleep with the lights on. "
It is very common to have other psychiatric comorbidities along with PTSD. The most common are Depression amd Anxiety.
"It would be preferable if we didn't talk too much, as it would only feed into my cravings, thanks for the offer though."
"Lastly, I hope you didn't delete your post because of me, I really just wanted to help even if I can come off strongly."
Not sure of your legal rules in your area but if you are a minor you don’t necessarily have a right to all the info.
Seeking help was the best thing I ever did for myself - hope is around the corner! You’ve got this :) be proud of you
"Side effects generally get better over time.  Maybe give it a bit of time?  I recommend Miralax, it is a non-stimulant."
Some men are just not wired to chase women. On top of college and girlfriends rack up a lot of expenses its more common
Thank you so much. Comments like these reassure me I can give myself a pat on the back for this step. Much love to you!
"Thank you! I want to go to a professional at some point. To be honest, I felt better from just writing all of this out."
Thank you. I’m in Aus and have been asleep. Feeling much fresher after a rest. Hope you had a beautiful morning walk!
"They're very warm, but otherwise I liked mine. Make sure you get the right weight (just over 10% of your body weight). "

You should check university clinics.  Most universities offer counseling sessions at a low price even to non students.
good on the mom. when somebody tells you they wanna kill themselves you don’t fucking tell them “you are stupid”
"no, i just hate righteous niggers who think they know everything about someone based on a fucking reddit post. jew boy."
"Admittedly I haven't given mindfulness the time I should, but what I've found far more effective is using daily positive affirmations and gratitude journals. I know it's not quite the same thing but I have trouble sitting and concentrating at the same place for a long time; this gives me a way to channel my energy somewhere and remind myself of things to keep me grounded. "
"Also, Ive seen this situation multiple times with different individuals: my stepsister, a couple female cousins, numerous friends. In a majority of cases, it wasnt them doing stupid things. They just hooked up with an asshole douche canoe. In my stepsisters case, there was some internet bullying that resulted in me punching a guy out. I am fanatically protective of my own."
"Bipolar is one of the most misdiagnosed disorders and not as common as most people think it is. If you've seen multiple doctors and they've told you that you may not have it, have they suggested anything else you might have? Be careful with self-diagnosing.

I thought I might have been bipolar as well (my dad is), turned out to actually be BPD. And I thought I was so sure!"
"Congrats! I wish sometimes that I could work but I have been declared permanently disabled because of my mental health issues, and with my most recent addition to that list, I don't think anyone would want to hire me. I think they would be afraid I would burn the place down. I wouldn't. I am not stupid, but still...  


I am happy for you though! I bet it feels awesome! :)"
Fear and disgust seem like quite different feelings to me. What does he fear about sleep? Is it that he won’t wake up? Is he scared of sleep paralysis? Or is it more that he thinks it’s a waste of time? It seems like he associates sleep with something that is a threat to him. That could be anything really. Has he said any more about it than what you have told us here?
"Here’s what I take.... 

*i am NOT a licensed healthcare professional... this is only my personal experience:

Ashwaganda 
Diindolylmethane (DIM) 
St. John’s Wort 
5HTP 
EPA/DHA (fish oil) with COQ10 
Multivitamin 
Valerian- although I’ve been cutting back on this one as it makes me not sleep well sometimes. 

Exercising is also extremely effective! 

Best of luck :)"
"Hey, so i have similar issues and i do have Borderline Personality Disorder. I would suggest talking to a therapist, going to your primary doctor even. If theres a crisis intervention in your area id call them and tell them about these issues too. If nothing more they can point you in the right direction. Hope you get this figured out. Message me if you need more support. "
"I am a self-harmer also...and kicking that habit is tough. Good for you that it has been 5 years! I had gone 5 years with no self-harm also, but recently...I just couldn't stop myself. Can you try distracting yourself? I know how hard it is to stop that behavior, but talking here is a start. I believe in you! You don't have to self harm. &lt;3 Sending all my love your way!"
"I don't have extremist/radical outlooks with a political or racial edge. That outlook doesn't resonate much clarity to me. I'm more referring to ideas about the general population who have good mental health and normative stable social lives being basically self-indulgent, selfish and being more mocking and judgmental of the isolated suffering people, than willing to help."
"I think when it comes down to it though, there is a difference in mental state between those thinking suicidal thoughts, and those who attempt suicide. Everytime I have attempted it has been on the lowest, most desperate rung of my life, and I don't think you've been there yet if you haven't attempted, so I would take that as a positive, it isn't a place you want to be. 

"
"I understand that, and for most of my 20s I didn't even have a drink as I'm not particularly interested in recreational drug use. 

Part of me actually thinks that an overdose would be a good way to make the decision to suicide without having to actually make that decision, but I am reasonably careful though. 

Thanks for your response and concern and I'll keep it in mind."
"I was thinking of seeing a therapist also. The thing is that I have no medical insurance, and no money. My first move is to land a job, and I have to work my way up till' i can comfortably afford a therapist. I've heard about the $60/week online therapists and I will give those a try first. I might be able to just talk to my Teacher who is a Psychiatric nurse practitioner."
"I would spend as little time there as possible. Go to a coffee shop, a park, anything that let's you basically get in, sleep, and get out


Oh, and check the laws regarding how you can possibly break your lease. There are some cases where you can, such as fear for your safety or if your landlord doesnt maintain the place. I've only heard of these, they need to be verified."
"I wouldn't take what they say too personally. The reality is that unless somebody's suffered through mental health issues before, they probably won't be able to help very much. Either that or they'll offer advice that's completely useless. Just keep taking your meds and stop caring about what your parents say. You're good enough. You just need to start acting like you are."
"I'm sorry but Shane has been awful for years. He just does things to gain attention, regardless of how morally bankrupt he has to be. There are better, more helpful youtubers to follow and watch. It's one thing for someone to make a mistake, but he keeps doing these kinds of things over and over again. That's an indication that he isn't someone worth giving the watch time."
I've got Generalised Anxiety Disorder and go in and out of depressive episodes.  I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years now.  Suffering from these has never noticeably affected my love for him or my sex drive but I do think it's dependent on each individual and the relationship you're in.  I'm extremely comfortable and feel safe with him so that may also be a huge factor.
Most people are goin to say to speak with professional. It's the right choice. There are a number of spychological factors that can play into that type of behaviour. Likely a traumatic event you may or may not remember is causing you this amount of unwarranted trust in others. Speaking word with a professional will award you much needed help than this site cant muster now.
"This actually makes me feel slightly less fucked up just knowing that other people do this. Not only that, I have some tunes to look up. 

I have a challenging day ahead of me, but I am in relatively good shape so far. At this moment I am ""riders of taramis"" by Basil Poledouris. Its the music that opens Conan The Destroyer. 

I hope all of you are able to kick todays ass. "
"Very common.  My doctor says that all SSRIs have side effects. We just have to choose the ones that are the least annoying.  I don't get the vivid dreams but I get the brain fog and fatigue.  My libido is also in the toilet.
 
If your symptoms get really bad, you can try something else but I can almost guarantee that whatever you try, will have its own set of side effects."
"Well I'm going thro something similar.
My problem is that I want professional help but I'm afraid of what can happen. Afraid of being judge.
Here where I live mental illness has become a thing because of the prescription drugs. I'm afraid that my parents, doctor or even friends will doubt my condition just to get into the drugs. (I had some problems with drugs in the past)"
"You can ask to shift gears with the therapist, speak openly and from the heart, if she doesn't listen ask your mother to find another therapist, A MALE... u can tell your mother, that you need to tslk to a man about man stuff. If neither your therapist or mother listens, id say that a very BIG problem bordering on emotional abuse and comenback here about what to do next..."
"You're not a fraud, you're a human, and your partner is recognizing and responding to your needs. Try to enjoy yourself, take the meds you have on schedule, and don't focus on meds. Your partner is trying to show you a good time - this may be an opportunity to try and let go of some things you are ruminating on, or to open up to your partner about your mental health needs."
"I have found LinkedIn to be a necessity in my career (I’m a lawyer) if only to keep up the appearance (i.e. so people see I took the effort to be on there and keep it updated). 
I have many professional clients, coworkers, etc. on there, but that’s about it.
I’ve found that, unlike other social media platforms, it’s very unlikely to trigger my anxiety and increase my struggle with low self esteem as I very rarely actually go on LinkedIn unless I have to update my information or respond to a connection request. 

Depending on your field, it might be a good idea to create an account! Or it might be totally useless... "
"I know EXACTLY how you feel. I’m assuming you’re an INFJ like me? I work in healthcare so I understand completely why you are feeling the way you do. I feel the same for animals too, I just don’t work with them. Please try and take a moment and be grateful for your huge heart, empathy and compassion you have. When I started to switch my mind set from feeling cursed to feeling grateful, it started to help. More people and animals NEED people like YOU, than people that AREN’T like you. Understand that every moment those animals are with you is a gift to them. Don’t take that away, they deserve your rare love ❤️ "
"I lived with an emotional absent dad. So I kinda relate when you say you put other older men on pedestal and yes, I think it's the lack of that father figure you would have liked to have. You know, the nurturing of the dad as well as the mom. I'd also find myself sort of idealizing manly figures, wishing they would take care of me and give me attention, even my uncle which was much nicer to me than my real dad. I think it's normal, to be honest. Everyone wants to feel taken care of, and when you don't get that element in your childhood it sort of spills a little bit as you grow up. Your inner child wants that.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Thank you! The thing that mostly bothers me is I feel like she's explaining the mental disorders SO incorrectly and making them out to be like ""If someone does x, then they have y."" when mental disorders are so complex and it can take a while to get a correct diagnosis. It's just frustrating seeing as I know the basics of mental disorders since I've had to deal with my own as well as friends and family with disorders. And she's making them into a joke and grossly misleading students as to what they really are.

She was fine the first few weeks, but now I can already tell I'm just gonna have to bite my tongue during lecture."
"So sorry you've had to go through all of that... Definitely get yourself into therapy. Maybe check out some of these videos.

I'd look for a therapist (maybe someone with a PsyD) who specializes in trauma, EMDR, or somatic experiencing. 

If you're in the US, you can ask any therapist to work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based. 

[Getting help with money issues](https://youtu.be/x_fFWXVRTV0?t=6m16s)

[Getting help when funds are low](https://youtu.be/wV9fjktyjfo)

Maybe check out the book The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk which talks a ton about trauma but in a way that's easy to understand. There's also Waking the Tiger by Peter Levine, and The Courage to Heal Workbook for Women and Men by Laura Davis.

I know this is an info dump but I hope something here helps. Keep fighting.

"We sat down with him tonight and had a lengthy discussion about it, since the surgery we have been trying to monitor his behavior, since it was such a huge ordeal for him (poor guy is 8, and got put under to get a peice of him ripped out that was potentially killing him!) the amount of stress it must of put on him had to be huge.  With that we asked him if he feels differently since the surgery, if his body feels different (sore), or if he just mentally feels things are different... He of course said no to all questions, that he feels fine.  The biggest problem i think I forgot to mention earlier was that during this discussion he said he thinks he's so worried about it, because that first day back to school, he was restricted to no physical contact, so no gym.  He sat outside with the other kids and couldn't do anything, he said he had a bee buzz around him, and when he looked down he had a spider on his shirt, which he flipped off his shirt.

Maybe the spider is the trigger for everything going on, but he said he's not afraid of spiders really, obviously afraid to be bitten, but not something to completely freak out over.

He was going to bed tonight and twice came out to stand near me and check every inch of his body.  He eventually asked why there were 2 red dots on his pajama pants, which I picked off, and showed him it was just lint/threads from clothes... he laid back down, and came out later to do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

With the lack of eating, we are starting with his pediatrician, and hopefully get a blood workup.  And just see what she thinks!

Thank you for reply, and sorry for being lengthy on this!"
By binomial im thinking dissociative identity disorder which can cause problems later in life but its more due to stress
"Feeling much better, quit my job and started with another company, sometimes its just about removing shit from your life"
Hmm. Where are you shocking yourself? What sort of relief does it give you? Immediate or does the relief last for hours?
"I can't stop taking them. Even if I am stable, when I reduce them, it negatively affects my mood which I did not expect."
I do that too occasionally. Makes me think about doing it to myself less. I like drawn stuff mostly. Real makes me cry.
I feel its the same as before but i feel more exhausted than before. I haven't noticed any increase in happiness though.
"I feel you dude. You aren't alone. Try to find the silver lining, because no matter how bad it is, there is always one. "
I think that would be a good idea. Especially since you have children. You wouldn’t have to be romantically involved.
I was in a similar situation because of “alienation” I guess. I just got sent to therapy to work on my social skills
It did for me. I tried to go off my meds without a dr a year ago and I almost killed myself. Please seek medical advice.
"Mindfulness, a walk around my garden and a list of things I did that day before I sleep (3 but couldn’t pick just one)"
One great way is one you're doing already. Recognizing their behavior as toxic and making an effort to not do the same.
"Reaching out for help is important, if you can't talk to friend or family, see a therapist .  What is a gender therapy? "
Shower brushing teeth doing your bed and doing the dishes are good items to have on your daily successes when depressed.
"Sounds like dissociation. I have it myself pretty seriously, don’t let it get to this... go get yourself checked out. "
"Thank you for sharing your experience. I'll try socializing more, though for the past week I have been more than usual. "
"Thank you! I’ve probably portrayed him in a pretty negative light - he’s lovely, just very wary of things like this "
Thanks. I don't know who I am...have no f'ing clue. Thanks so much for your kindness though. Have a wonderful night/day.
"Thanks. I read that being ""cured"" from this is unlikely, but it can be managed with behavior therapy and meds. Great. :("
"Then you are probably taking sub- therapeutic doses, thus spending money on prescriptions without getting any benefits. "
Wish you luck OP. If it were me I'd try getting him committed if he won't get help. This is a very difficult situation.
"Yes, and I researched art therapists in my area , but my mom still thinks that the one I have is the only one available."
"Yes. I have, and I am looking into finding more suitable support for my issues because nothing seems to be working atm. "
Your goal is unhealthy and dangerous. Most likely you won't disclose this to her because you know she will say the same.
"Your mental health is worth a switch. Keep looking for other jobs, and grind this out while you can. You’ll be alright"
"&gt; individual must also present three or more of the below symptoms, and  last at least four consecutive days and be present most of the day,  nearly every day  
&gt;  
&gt;Bipolar II is notoriously difficult to diagnose 

No and no to present most of the day nearly every day for at least four consecutive days.

Unless there's something lesser than Bipolar II, I doubt it."
"I haven't no. Usually when I talk about it in anyway, it's met with the assumption that I'm lying or making up excuses to why I'm a bit distant. I think if I were to 'fight back' it would just get worse, like if I were to criticize how they think of it even though doing so would benefit the whole situation. So I'm afraid to, but I guess it has to be done for it to improve. "
"I think that until you find somebody you can really trust, it's hard to get much out of therapy. That was my experience anyway. One of my parts outed herself mid-session when the therapist said, 'Don't worry, I have clients who have parts. Do you sometimes have parts that don't feel like you?' It was a big turn-around for us and we started getting help that actually worked."
"One. You are not a loser. 

Two. If she is worth her salt she will know that and never feel that way

Three. Just tell her that you want to see someone else. You don’t have to say why. A professional will not take it personally. One of the first things my therapist said to me is that if I don’t feel like it’s a good fit to tell her and we will find me someone who is. "
"Thanks, I have spoken to people and been diagnosed but the NHS is in bits at the minute and fast treatment is a distant fantasy for most. I am functional, and have weaned myself off medication and am still functional, but just wary of this causing me problems when i come into my mid twenties and want to get it resolved as soon as possible. I hope all goes well for you also!"
"There are lawyers who specialize in this sort of thing, and by law they are not allowed to charge you anything unless they get you past-due benefits, and even then they're limited to the lesser of (I think) $6,000 or 1/4 of your past-due benefits.  

Go to your state's bar association website or call your local legal aid office.  They can point you in the right direction.  "
"Yes, there is. I took one administered by a psychologist. I remember it was just like those multiple choice tests where you fill in a circle.  It was very long.  I did a Rorschach Test, as well; but, I don't know if that's in practice anymore.  They know how to read them, and apply an appropriate diagnosis. If you're having a hard time, you should go.  It's fairly painless."

"I can see why they'd ""turn down"" people. It's actually against therapists' code of ethics to treat problems they aren't qualified to treat. Plus more severe problems likely require face to face evaluation.

BUT! A good therapist will give proper consultation and referrals, not just send you an email and say, ""can't help. Bye!"". That's awful.

As a mental health professional and a person who also has mental health issues, I hate the ads too. I think they're very suspicious. I like the idea of more accessible care, and I like the idea of integrating technology into mental health services. But these ads feel almost predatory..."
"I have the SAME tattoo on the inside of my right wrist!!! :D I have also survived many attempts (2 of them recently and serious where I almost died) and I am damn proud of that. Great news and I hope you do keep going and don't give up!

By the way...did it hurt on your back? It kinda hurt on my wrist, but it was so brief that I didn't mind it too much. I kept saying OW OW OW OW OW which amused the tat artist lol. I am getting another tat on my left forearm, but I can't reveal what I am getting. It would be obvious if you knew my issue that I am going through now though. Good luck to you and this post truly made me happy! :)"
"The worst part is ""never date someone with a personality disorder, they're all abusers"" sentiment is almost always from people who have had bad experiences with someone *they themselves and not a professional* diagnosed as having a personality disorder, too.  

There's entire subreddits dedicated to stigmatising personality disorders and that spread enormous amounts of false information about them from people like this. Imagine if the hatred towards people with them was directed at people with any other mental health issue, and if it was about something like an ethnicity? A subreddit like that would be deleted as a hate sub."
"You could try talking to your parents again. Ask them for a compromise and let the doctor decide about your mental health?

I don't know how old you are, but if you are at school, college or university,  they may have counseling services available. If you are older and in work, your workplace may offer some similar service.

You could phone helpline in your region?

Depending on your circumstances, you could try a different doctor?

Otherwise, I am out of ideas and you are going to have to go see your current doctor and accept your parents might find out, though I personally would expect them to respect your confidentiality."
"First of, I would suggest not calling your daughter a bitch in your screen name. She sounds to me very mentally ill, and needs to be on psychiatric medication and constant therapy. This isn’t her fault. She isn’t a bad person or a bad kid, she is mentally ill. Your wife threatening to leave your family will make everything worse. The worst possible thing you can do is take this shit personally. Your daughter needs help. Blaming her for the outbursts and the self medicating isn’t going to do shit. Sorry but if I were you, I’d find her some sort of boarding facility for mentally unstable teens. She can get an education and be constantly monitored by nurses and doctors. Sounds like severe depression and a combination of other things. Somewhere deep down, she still loves you guys. But she is mentally ill. And that needs to be taken just as seriously as any other illness. "
"Oh, sadness is certainly part of depression but that's certainly not its entire shtick. Recounting from my experience I'd say...
-Feeling not ""sad"", but just ""down"", heavy, listless... 
-apathy, &amp; sometimes simultaneously apathetic &amp; frustrated/feeling like a caged animal
-Losing interest or not feeling satisfied in things you enjoy/previously enjoyed, or being unable to get excited about something in a way you ""should"" be or maybe were before
-I used to have this distinct feeling like I was not feeling much and was watching from the inside while my shell performed emotions for social acceptance 
-Indulging in compulsive things like overeating, oversleeping and not knowing why (it's because, while unhealthy, they were comforting and i didn't feel ok but wasn't completely concious of it)
Not sure if this would end up being relevant but since you asked... Hope it helps "
"This has happened to me, it know exactly how it feels. What I've done is get the doctor's contact info and ask who they can recommend, or maybe they're willing to do phone sessions. This person knows you, and hopefully wants you to succeed in life. If you wind up with a different therapist, ask if they can spend some time time going over any notes in your records, or maybe they will be willing to talk to the last doctor directly (it makes their job easier too). It's an awful transition, but starting from scratch also gives you an opportunity to see how far you have come. You have five years of hindsight, use it to your advantage. The first time this happened to me, I was so upset my mom had to do the work for me, I just sat next to her crying while she made calls and got me set up with someone new. If you have a support system in place, don't be afraid to use it. Best of luck"
"Hey there, as a formerly 24-yr-old-therapist, I can definitely get that it can be uncomfortable. From the other perspective, I can tell you that there was never any judgment or feelings on my end that the person I was seeing, at whatever age they are, wasn't getting as far as I did (at least on paper). Personally, I recognize that privilege and luck helped in my situation.

Here's something to think about, though. She may be fresh out of school, so she doesn't have a ton of experience, but she does have some very recent learning. New therapists are more likely to change up their methods because they haven't settled into their patterns. I have read that new therapists can be more effective due to attitude and recency of learning skills.

She also is likely to really understand what it is like to be your age. She knows what the world is like for millennials and hopefully will have a good ability to gain perspective on your experience.  Every demographic aspect can have it's pros and cons.

As others have said, it's a great thing to talk about, and at the end of the day, you're still allowed to have whatever preferences you have."
"You seem like you're intelligent enough to understand why it's so hard to find the kind of advice you're looking for. Most people will want to find a solution for you that means you will continue living. Personally, I think everyone has the right to end their own life but, being somebody who has spent a large amount of their life feeling suicidal, I would always look at ways to fix some of the things that led a person to be in that state.

I know that isn't helpful to you. I'm just trying to say that I think you're justified in wanting to find a place to discuss it with like-minded people as I know the frustration of people being dismissive and thinking they know better, but I also sympathise with those who try to help you.

I do hope you choose to live, especially since you are still quite young and have plenty of growing to do, but it is your life and no one else's, so I don't think you're wrong for wanting to explore all your options objectively.

Sorry if this as a useless comment, it's a tough one to know how to deal with. I hope you find what you're looking for and make the right decision for you, whatever that might be."
"Hey, 

My advice to you, would be to always come from a place of love. Hug him, tell him how much he means to you. Have your parents do the same. I have the same issues your brother has, and whenever I’m greeted with aggressive behavior it forces me to meet that threshold with more aggression. It’s like a competition who can get more pissed. My brother started just coming in my room and saying “I love you” and giving me a hug. I wish my parents would do the same.

Having mental illness makes you feel so alone and so confused. You know you’re fucking up everything in your life but you can’t  fix it. It’s a prison. So my advice is, love on him. And when he gets mad, love on him more. 

Do some activities together. One thing that has always helped me and I return to every time is boxing. There’s something about punching someone and getting punched in the face that is SO INCREDIBLY THERAPEUTIC. Enroll in a boxing gym with him, and make sure you spar don’t just hit pads  getting hit is essential part of life. It shows us that we can bounce back even when we’re attacked.

I hope everything works out for your brother and your family. This is not easy, and in my family I’m the sick one. I have constantly pushed people away, thrown glasses, punched holes in walls. Boxing took away a lot of that aggression. I’ve seen it save lives time and time again. 

Take care "
"I do the usual meditation and exercise stuff which helps a lot. I try to focus on a handful of things that I know I want to achieve in life before I die (e.g. have children). That isn't always enough.

When it gets really bad I allow myself to take a more morbid approach and try to see it as a test, to see how much pain and suffering I can endure. I try to think things like: *if I ever did kill myself, I sure as hell want to make sure I deserved it*. This helps me crawl through to the next day. I need to know that suicide really was the only option, so I just bank on there always being another way to confirm that it is the only way to change things. Unless I'm 100% certain that there's no other choice then I'm selling myself short by not exploring it, and I can force myself to endure another day of suffering. That's what I try to think as a last ditch effort.

But these are just ways I deal with it by myself. If you're having these thoughts, reach out and get treatment. You have a lot of options to explore there and any one of them could completely transform your life. Until you've tried them, I would say that you would be wasting an opportunity to lead a good life that could truly bring benefit to you and others. Don't pass up that opportunity until you've tried everything else, and always look for new things to try, and keep fighting.

Message me any time if you want to talk."
"well its natural to feel like that for awhile... but then its so heavy and difficult carrying that rage long term... so i do whatever it takes to lessen it to take the burden off. It sounds like you just need an outlet to allow your rage to explode. Killing every person that has wronged you is unrealistic, a lot of work and very illegal. Find something else that works for you, distraction, forgiveness, empathy,  gratitude, venting, writing, etc. 

When I was 7-8, my mean abusive babysitter accused me of drawing on her bathroom walls with a pen. There were other kids she watched over, but she insisted that it was me and told my parents how bad I was for doing that. I never did it but i got scolded and punished for it anyway. When i was 18, a crazy lady tboned me, totaled my car and while i was in the emergency she blamed it all on me and threatened to hit me on the stretcher anytime i tried to speak up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt so much rage for awhile but as I got older, I realized and accepted that things in life can't always be fair or right. Having accepted this sad truth about the world, it helped me let go of a lot of anger and pain. You must be exhausted from holding onto the rage since you were 5. Working to forgive doesn't mean the other person is innocent and did nothing wrong, but it's really for yourself to not be burdened down with such negative emotions all the time. "

"Remember that people change a lot in their 20s. It's normal to drift from people as you all change.

That said, I'm not in my 20s any more and I still do it. I'm doing it right now actually. I do it because I feel like having people care about me is just one more thing to worry about, and because I feel like I need to control everything in my life, and friends are an unpredictable unknown quantity.

My friends are all desperately worried about me and I'm pushing them all away because I can't handle the extra stress of having friends on top of everything else that's happening at the moment.

I don't think this is healthy on the long term but I feel like it's what I need right now. It's something I want to fix, but I'm focusing on fixing other things first.

I don't know if our reasons are the same or similar, but I can definitely relate to the urge to cut people out of my life."
"The first thing to do is have a talk with her doctor.  If there is a story as to why that can't happen, contact the Office of Aging in your city and have her evaluated.

"Reading this reminds me of how I was as a child. Now, as a 31 year old with anxiety, I realize that a lot of the thoughts I had as a kid were anxiety. I would constantly worry about bad things happening (carbon monoxide poisoning, car crashes, fires in the house) and would cry myself to sleep at night. I would have very mature thoughts, then feel terrible about them because I felt they were “bad”. 
From my experience, I was treated for my anxiety at around 16 years old and I’m thankful for it. I’ve tried different anxiety meds and finally found one that works for me. I do NOT want you to think I am pushing the thought of using an anti anxiety medication on you, but I sometimes wonder how different my life would have been growing up If my anxiety had been treated at an earlier age. 
Keep talking to her, keep reassuring her that whatever thoughts she is having are normal and she is not bad for thinking them. She is a bright young girl who seems to be very intelligent. Her mind is constantly going and thinking of things. Encourage her to journal and write out her thoughts. She will be fine, and she will get through this.

"Realizing that even in loneliness, there are others who feel the same, and in that regard you arnt really alone, reaching out like you have with this post helps, hopefully this comment will help.
I feel lonely despite being surrounded by amazing family, friends, and an incredible boyfriend, sometimes I just feel misunderstood. It's a different kind of loneliness, where you just feel like your the only one who thinks about the world in a certain way or the only person who feels this way or no one could understand the complexity of your thoughts. There are rare people in the world and usually being lonely is a sign of being so incredibly unique. The way i think about things sometimes, is I imagine people like Einstein or Tesla or Van Gogh, history tells us so often how genius's way ahead of their time did such great incredible things, and they where some of the loneliest people. Imagine having an idea so grand you change the world, like the light bulb for example, life totally completely changed for the world, only one person thought of it. Imagine how lonely it is to be the only person with a thought, but that thought was so brilliant. We are taught that loneliness is a bad thing, but it's actually okay. It's okay to be so unique that noone thinks like you, it's okay to be different, once you start embracing your individually I think you'll find comfort in knowing noone should be the same like society tries to conform us to. When we realize there are plenty of people like us who are feeling the same way, but expressing themselves all so uniquely and differently it's easy to see that loneliness could actually bring people together."

I don’t know if they’re all just hyper-empathetic ‘cause they look really weirded out. My family is scared of me being aggressive, my mom has started talking to me only if necessary basically."
"This is exactly the same as me - mental illness can happen to anyone regardless of how good their life may seem from an outside point of view.

I also repress my feelings and keep busy so I don't have to confront them - but there comes a time when I experience them all at once and it's awful. You sound like you're experiencing anxiety/depression - you're certainly not alone! "
"This whole year has been one perpetual quarter life-existential crisis for me hahaha. I'm terrified of leaving my early 20's (currently 21). The thought of my friends moving on and becoming professionals, settling down, having kids, etc is terrifying to me because I feel like that's such a grey area for me atm, that and your 20's are the ""best years of your life,"" and whatevs"
"I can tell you what you need to get a woman 100% 

Get rid of this terrible mindset you have. No woman is going to fall for someone who is oozing with frustration and anger. As long as you have this mind set you wound get a girl. 

Also pretending to not feel the way you do when you interact with women wouldn’t work, they will sense it and go running.

This is on you buddy, not on anyone else. The only way to to change this is by working on your attitude. 

No one wants a sandwich covered with shit, try wiping it off first and then see if someone will bite. But it has to be clean, people can smell left over shit a mile away."
"It’s draining.

It’s unimaginably difficult. 

I’m in a similar boat. My wife is suffering from depression, as am I. 

I display myself as a fun(ny) outgoing type, for the benefit of her and our son. I’ve always used being a goofy guy as a coverup. Lately I’ve reached an extreme low, yet so has my wife. I use everything I have to help her, and allow for her to get through what she’s going through.

I’m draining myself daily, however I know our son needs her so I put it all into her. Going to work gives me some time to just autopilot and store some energy to use with my boy when I’m home until he goes to bed. 

"
"The lord didn't solve your problems, and its quite apparent by what is happening right now. I'm seriously pulling together every ounce of restraint within me and trying to stick to relevant information here... 
Nothing that you are saying would EVER come from someone who truly called themselves a Christian and bothered to educate themselves on God.  You're a disgrace using it as a crutch to hide behind rather than facing your problems and accept your own faults. I really do hope for you and your family's sake that He helps you come to find love, acceptance, and forgiveness as that is what he teaches, not parental abandonment. "
"I was diagnosed with BPD in college. It broke my heart as well. When I gathered the courage to tell my parents, they didn’t believe me. This really made me question my diagnosis at times. 

The diagnosis did create a lot of relief for me, though. I felt like I had a better idea of what I was dealing with. For the first time in a while I felt like I fit into a category... which was not something I thought I’d ever feel again. 

With that being said, though, you really are not your disorder. Don’t let yourself start to live your diagnosis... think of BPD as a large umbrella. You may be somewhere under that umbrella (you even might not be). What I’m trying to say is that not two peoples’ illnesses look exactly alike, so focus every day on what helps you live a healthier life. 

I wish you luck with this journey. Sincerely feel free to message me about anything any time. "
"I went through similar thought processes. I had been struggling since high school but never let my parents or friends see just how bad it was. I would tell myself I didn't want meds to change me. and I was able to handle my anxiety and depression for years with sheer will power. but my then girlfriend, now fiancé, was also struggling. except she's been getting help and medication for years. 
ever since I lowered my walls to her and she saw how bad I was she insisted for me to get help. It wasn't until I moved away from my parents that I felt like I didn't have to hide and see a doctor. but the process takes so long that even deciding I needed help months ago I'm still not on medication.

If you know now that you need help then get help now, because it is such a slow process that waiting a few months or years will only strain your relationships more and put more stress on you. "
"Keep trying bro, I’ve been where your friend is and it’s a hard place to get out of. It’s even harder when your friends distance themselves from you so keep reaching out to them and making sure they’re ok. Make them realise that the world does care about them and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I spent six years verging on suicide, it’s a long tough road but you have to fight, giving in isn’t the solution.  It’s a long tough road and one that you spend most of the journey fighting with yourself in your head. Your friend just needs to find their coping mechanism and look towards some CBT therapy even online there is some good resources to help them out. 

Much the same way as you can’t conquer a fear by giving in to it, you have to fight depression/suicidal thoughts to stand any chance of getting past them. 

I hope your friend gets through this."
"I can relate. I moved abroad, been through a lot, I feel nothing comes easy and I don't even have my full support circle present. Everything is an uphill battle that takes time, ton of effort, discipline, patience...

In the eyes of my friends I'm strong, I've overcome so many things, I'm independent, I figure out stuff on my own, they always come to me for advise...I appreciate that.

But inside I'm just sick of being strong I just wish that for a while things just came easier. I get jealous of a few friends who just get taken care of by their husbands, even though I know I'm not really like that. I'm proud of everything I've accomplished and that I'm not dependent on anyone and don't owe anyone anything, but some days I do fantasize about a Superman just taking care of me, at least for a while, and it makes me jealous. Or like when people start assuming I'm always gonna organize outings and they show no initiative and disappear for a month...HEY I need YOU to reach out and say you wanna see me too, you know? 

What helps me is mindfulness, and also make sure you express your needs to others, don't repress them. You gotta take it easy on yourself, be gentle to yourself. Do more things that help you slow down and enjoy the little things. I learnt I'm a home body and I use the weekend to take care of myself, only going out for a coffee or dinner with a friend but not being out the whole weekend. I need the silence to recharge cause I'm more on the introverted end. Accept some projects are long term and find activities that help you fill that void short-term so you are not obsessing too much. That's what I try to do. It's not magically easy and you will have ups and downs.. but acknowledge all you have accomplished and just be patience and kind to yourself, stick to the process, you will have everything you want and more because you're a fighter and don't give up.

&amp;#x200B;

My depression comes in spurts. There are times where I dont feel like doing anything. I am still able to kiss my husband. "
"Hey there, as someone who has a lot of experience with this, if you ever want to talk about it I’d love to help if I can!"
"Hi  sure you are seeing, though, that with the state you are in you start to pose a safety risk being untreated. , I'm dad!"
"I mean, it could be part of the process, or it could be a sign that you need a new therapist. Hard to tell without details."
I saw my doctor and started on a medication. They take so long to start working so it doesn't seem to matter at this point.
I should think it's possible especially if your tics get worse with stress and being around other people stresses you out.
"I was actually curious if there were any books out there I could read. I'm going to purchase this later today, thank you :)"
"I was in therapy for about 5 months, once a week sessions. It was definitely worth the time and money invested. Good luck!!"

"Thank you! Tomorrow marks the anniversary when I left home, just wanted to share. I appreciate you taking the time to read."
"Thanks for your response, do you know if it's exclusive to bipolar? Or if there are other mental disorders with hypomania? "
"We need a community of support. No one should go through life with no support, especially when it comes to Mental struggles"
Yes in class I sometimes see hands across the table and hear people saying my name when no one is. and thank you very much
"i dont really know how it works. dont you need to pay and have insurance to go

"this is a common theme on /r/BPD  ... not saying this is you, necessarily, but the resemblance is striking on this aspect. "
"As a woman I'd be a lot more responsive to someone asking me 'hey I'm really struggling with something and I think your input would help' than being tricked into sharing memories through an answer machine. Likewise men are capable of having conversations made up of several words! Women and men are both just people, you don't need this weird codified approach to speak to them. "
"Bipolar is an illness that can be managed with medication. It is a mood disorder.

Borderline is a personality disorder that can generally only be treated through therapy.

Personality disorders are difficult to treat because they are intrinsically part of the person’s  personality. But someone with bipolar disorder doesn’t have a bipolar personality, they have an illness."
"Bipolar, BPD, and OCD, all have their own subs that I'm sure are very supportive. I follow the r/BPD subreddit and find it a good place to vent, share experiences, get support, etc. Are you in any type of therapy? CBT and DBT also have their own subs. Maybe play around with it and see which one you feel most comfortable in, or hop around between several depending on the topic!"
"Doing just about anything takes a tremendous amount of energy and willpower. When I am depressed I don't feel like eating or sleeping...or I sleep constantly. When youre depressed you need people around you to be considerate and helpful and you need people to be gentle with you and understanding. 

I am depressed today...so I am there with you. I understand how you're feeling."
"Haha yeah it is pretty ironic, but i think often people are pretty attached to their egos and focussed on their own thoughts. Its almost natural to not be immersed in our surroundings which you feel 10 fold while on psychedelics. 
I think getting into meditation could help heaps as it lets you practice being completely present which you can then adapt more into your daily life"
"It's just a fantasy. I get off on all sorts of shit, some things that would freaking people out. It's  no big deal.

However what would be considered mental illness towards what you're hinting at would be require some of: a disregard for self and/or others, deceitfulness, impulsively, failure to conform to social/lawful norms, constant irresponsibility &amp;/or lack of remorse"
"Then if it's your sister, you need to keep things short and sweet. Don't be overly rude but don't be overly friendly either. Just keep things civil.

And that last part is entirely up to you. I know you say that you don't want to be alone. And I know that being alone can hurt. But is it really worth being taken advantage of? That's something you'll have to decide on your own. "
Yes! I do have interaction with people at my current job that I’ve been able to hold onto for almost a year; after being fired/quitting other jobs after 1 month. But my interaction isn’t so much as selling. It’s just friendly interactions passing by. I guess doing solo work has helped me and not waking up super early. Is your work schedule any different this time around?
You need to go back to the doctor. And you need to be completely 100 percent honest about how you feel. Don't ignore these symptoms. You also need to get yourself into therapy. There's no shame in getting help. Your family needs to accept the fact that there's something wrong going on. You need to get help as soon as possible. Don't take a risk of these symptoms getting worse.
"legit schizophernia or you think you have it... im the same way exept the schizo.. but im always afraidn that I would develop that as a resukt of not getting treated.. I think I am traumatized... There was a party I went to and inhaled Nitrous Oxide or laughing gas, and since then everything just sinked... and all this shit came up.. shit that never came up in the first place "
"Constant reassurance. I know that you’ve said you do that already, but don’t let it falter. 

Remember that when she says mean things, it’s the condition and not a reflection of you. Although, make sure you set boundaries in this regard - don’t let yourself become a verbal punchbag. 

Just being there is sometimes enough. Sometimes words aren’t necessary. Just being present can be enough to help someone when they’re in their dark place. 

Help out with things (chores etc). When you’re in the throes of a bad bout of depression, even the smallest task is overwhelming. Taking off some of that load can go a long way. "
"Robyn, I suggest you do an online search for ""DBT courses"" and ""DBT training.""  I just did and there are numerous online courses being offered.  Also, DBT workbooks are readily available.

Originally developed to treat BPD, *Dialectical Behavior Therapy* teaches people a variety of coping skills that will help you better regulate your own emotions and impulses -- e.g., how to self-sooth to calm down and how to better avoid black-white thinking.  

You can learn a lot on your own.  If you can afford it, however, it would be even better to attend one of the weekly DBT training programs that are offered in nearly all major cities."
"You aren't passively dehydrating yourself; you are actively dehydrating yourself. You've gotta think whether you might be neglecting yourself or punishing yourself. Do you deny yourself other needs regularly? If so, or if you have depressive or eating disorder symptoms to go with it, it may be time to reach out to a therapist. 

In any case, just remember that every second is a new opportunity to take a drink of water. It may help to make yourself take even just one sip if the idea of drinking a whole glass is overwhelming. Bargain with yourself: if I take one sip of water, I can watch a show, have a piece of chocolate, etc... "
"""Do no harm but take no sh-t"" is the maxim I try to live by, tbh.

Yes, people could be anybody. And to a point, I try to be forgiving and accommodating. Everybody should try to be understanding, to a point. But I am also a person with limits and needs and weaknesses, who needs compassion and kindness. And sometimes in an online interaction, the only person who's going to show me that compassion and kindness is myself.

So sometimes, you have to be less than a doormat to someone, in order to show *yourself* the compassion that you yourself need to survive.

It's a balance.

(I also don't recommend even trying to find this balance with people who are being outright sadistic or severely bigoted. Sure, you don't have to and probably shouldn't sink to their level. But you don't have to be nice to say, a TERF or a nazi or someone who is suicide baiting unless you absolutely want to.)"

"Funnily enough, I brought that up when I had my verbal warning. They claimed that ""engaging the customers is what separates us from other stores, so we need you to adhere to that guidelines."" The issue is that there are several managers who walk the floor and it always seems like whenever I have a quiet moment or a couple customers who make it clear they don't want to engage in a conversation, the managers always seem to catch me in those moments and accuse me of ""doing nothing"" and ""not engaging"". It's frustrating. 

Whats even more annoying is that my ""manager"" constantly harks on how we aren't hitting the sales goals, we aren't doing etc... and I've seen the numbers, we're doing 3x better than the department did last year alone and I'm mostly doing it myself. I know it's their job to ""motivate"" but its hardly motivation when I barely get a thank you or some sort of reprieve.
"
"I understand the discomfort. But this actually is a good opportunity for you to practice in two ways.

First, age is not always correlated to ""life position."" Try to take the age out of it and focus on the person's behavior and qualities. What you are experiencing will happen more as you get older. Some day you will hopefully be in your 40s or older and you may still have peers, doctors, even bosses who are much younger than you are. 

Second, comparing yourself to others is the pathway to misery. You are only you, there is no race, and the only person you should compare to is yourself of yesterday. This discomfort too will happen more when you get older. You'll run into people who have ""achieved more"" and think you ""should be"" at a particular place based on others you see around you. The sooner you tear down this artificial construct, the more quickly you can achieve happiness."
"Thank you for your post - first of all it’s 14 weeks to speak to my kids under supervision and move in after 6 months to a year. 

Second of all, I wasn’t the only one in the relationship who screwed up, we both did. I am was the one with the mental illness not the physical one. 

I’m sorry about your situation and no I am not seeking attention from my husband or anyone else - if I did the whole world would know what I am going through. And I would be completely breaking our rules. Yes I am aware of what I did to my kids that’s why I am keeping the rules. 

And finally yes I was a good mother. I did everything I was supposed and no I didn’t seek attention from them. I just didn’t know how to be open with them. 

And about cps our neighbors hated us and that’s how the whole thing started. 

I am not expecting empathy. I am asking if anyone else went through something similar because from what I read on the online about cps, mothers yell and go through depression and get back their kids. 

Your feedback was valuable. I hated it. It was an eye opening though. I think there was more to the situation the  meets the eye. "
"I’m not sure when he really started getting depressed, maybe about a year ago. 

I know they can have a genetic component. My best friend has to take anti depressants and she has explained the process of that to me before. 

I’m honestly not sure what’s causing this right now.  As I stated above, he just started high school and they just moved into their new house, in the same city. But, he insists School is fine and it was definitely an upgrade moving into the new house, he finally got a big room and the upstairs all to himself. 

I don’t know if I he is completely done with puberty or not. A few months ago he started getting peach fuzz above his lip. He has developed quite a bit of acne. His voice has also gotten A LOT deeper. I don’t know what all the steps are in a males puberty, so I don’t know if he is done or not. 

I feel like my brother has always sorta had problems with his emotions. When things weren’t going right he when he was younger would always get extremely mad and start crying. He has a VERY short fuse. My mom told me he isn’t very nice to her anymore, he yells at her and is “disrespectful,” as she says. I don’t know much about that situation. 

I guess I should’ve included this in my original post, but he has had a HARD LIFE. Moving from trailer to trailer, his dad (my stepdad) beat my mother CONSTANTLY, my stepdad used to do A LOT of drugs and he would drink with them. He has developed a lot of medical problems, so he doesn’t do any drugs except smoke weed now, he still drinks a lot though. 
His childhood sucked, always having the police have to come to his house, always having to hear my parents scream and fight, always seeing him hit her or try to choke her or hold a gun to her head. It got REALLY REALLY BAD. I think they still fight a lot, my stepdad keeps his hands to himself more now. But, that’s some more background on his life. "
"16 clueless, depressed people who will stay that way. Keep downvoting truth. You will remain in Hell. That's where you are. "

It seems like the NHS are unwilling to help until you've completely fucked your life into the ground. I've given up trying.

"Making unfounded assumptions and hurting people.

*While in front of a computer screen*, I might add.  Nice hypocrisy there."
"No but seriously it’s not RAD, although I haven’t felt too much love as a child, but at the same one I didn’t care to "
Right. But most people have jobs and yet most people still find time to do things they enjoy. Do you have time on weekends?
So sorry for what you and your family are going through.  You might find the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) helpful.
"Talk to your parents, what do they think of this? Is he getting the treatment he needs, has he been diagnosed/has a doctor? "
"Thank you for your lengthy reply, I really hope you find your way :)

I would not want to lead her on, nobody deserves that."
"Thanks for the tip, never heard of schema therapy, took a quick look at Google, sounds interesting. Did you do on your own? "
"Therapy can help you find coping methods, or help you find the root of your issues. Either way, you should seek out therapy."
"Yeah. We have a place lined up, the hospital rehab place has to release her first. It's a kind of cover their ass type deal."
"Yes you can. You can beat your depression, you have to keep fighting. We like having you around so please, stay for awhile. "
"&gt;  I don't particularly want to commit suicide, it's just the last resort I'm finally at after I feel like I've tried everything I can. 

But you haven't. That's all I am really saying. One of the very most important things to try -- getting professional help -- is something you haven't done yet.

I can't make you do or not do anything. I'm just asking you to think about it."
"&gt;  Lots of symptoms can often be from other (mental) illnesses too so never just assume. It's better to get help early on though, then you've got a better chance at healing. Hopefully for you it isn't bpd. I've got it and it's not fun. At all.

yeah, i serious fucking hope i don't. i need to see whats wrong with me. i need a psychiatrist. i sorry you have that disorder dude."
"At least going with a routine ""alright"" is much preferable than the expected ""good"" response here. 

Whenever I respond with ""alright"" over here, people can pick up on that you may not be in the best of moods.

Edit: but it does sound pretty much the same overall. Has it ever bothered you on a bad day? I know it's not really such a big deal as I'm making it, but.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Continue to be there as best as you can.  Try not to feed into her delusions and instead be as compassionate as you can and let her know you're concerned for her.  

Sometimes, some people just all of a sudden realize that there's something not right about them and come to terms with needing help and they'll seek it.  I hope this will be the case for your friend. 

Good Luck :)"
"Could it be derealization/depersonalization? This can happen as a result of depression, PTSD, etc

There's also a rare disorder that happened to this woman, where after intense mental stress she developed a condition where she always feels like she is dreaming, ie, unfocused vision and sounds, lights are incredibly bright, etc. Been going on for years, even until now, I believe"
"I second this. 

I don't have a job at all and was able to get on medicaid. I am able to get medication on it, therapy and it helps with doctors as well. Not all doctors and therapists are covered, but you can find them. I have been on this for several years and it helps a heap!

Also, once you have that, try https://www.psychologytoday.com/us

It'll help you find a therapist. "
Just be honest. Tell him what your symptoms are and that you are concerned. I know that you don’t want to worry your mom or put more stress on her but trust me if she knew that you chose to hide what you were going through just to protect her it would hurt her worse. I’m proud of you you for taking the initiative to get help. That is a huge step and nothing to take lightly.
"Maybe we can start with what your hobbies and interests are. Do you enjoy gaming? Do you like to work with children or animals? Do you love to read, write, sing, dance? You say you suck at them, but that's okay. 

Imagine a perfect day for you: what are you doing on that day? 

*hug* feel free to message me to chat. I'm not a doctor, but I can listen and try to help brainstorm!"
"My comment is absolutely on point. OP is concerned about how they are perceiving the capabilities of their young therapist, and I read between the lines into their chosen diction. I might’ve been wrong, but my intentions are clear. Word choice can bring a lot of incite into a person’s psyche. 

And please, avoid the phrase “people like you.” It belittles your argument. "
"No easy answer.  If they are unwilling or unable to go, your best bet is to join a mental health support group yourself.  These are for family and friends.  There you will find what resources are available and you will meet people in similar circumstances.

Being in a different state is going to be an additional challenge but start with [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support)"
"Nope. No intentions on drinking. I don't crave it, I can be around it and not even mind...I made up my mind and I feel better for it. :)

Thanks for this. I needed to hear some kind words. My disorder is really beating the hell out of me right now. I want to start a fire so badly but I can't at the moment and I am rfighting that off. Blah. Thanks for helping me a bit though. :)"
"That's awful! Employers or university or whatever she does may have access to occupational health services, and a strategy for offering interventions. 
If it's proper bad there is going to be a trained mental health nurse at A and E who can assess mental state there and then and offer an idea of what services are available and immediate intervention in terms of discussing it. 
"
"&gt; consent is a bullshit concept. 

I'm not even sure what to say to this, but I think you will have a hard time finding any therapist of any stripe to agree to such a notion.

Wanting to accept responsibility can be very adult and even useful but only if placed in the right context. IME most people try to take too much responsibility onto themselves, which is likely why most therapists push back on you. It is not a matter of liberal versus conservative.

And most therapists are liberal rather than conservative because being a therapist generally requires attributes more often found in liberals or moderates than conservatives."
"Aw I wish I had something that would help. I find that when my Pyromaniac urges come on that distracting myself with funny vids on YT or getting engrossed in TV helps, but I KNOW how hard suicidal feelings are to distract from. They kind of eat up your whole being and make it hard to see or do anything. I was there about 3 years ago. I am glad you will get help. If you feel like you are going to do it, go to the nearest ER immediately. Don't play around with those feelings...believe me. They saved me just in time. Twice. If you want someone to talk to who knows what you're going through, you can message me on here. :) Take care."
"Don't internalize all of her actions and words. She is crying out for help through her 'attention-seeking' behaviors. You seem to be victimizing everyone but the actual victim, your older daughter. You're blaming her for everything that has happened to your family when you and your wife are her parents, her caregivers. It is your responsibility to make sure she gets the help she needs through therapy and/or medication. The most important thing you need to remember is that she's 16 years old. She isn't even an adult. She will make mistakes, a lot of them, and she needs your guidance to love herself and improve her mental health. "
"I don’t know how to best word this but I would say expecting the child to deal with adult issues/topics. For example if the parents have issues they shouldn’t knowingly dump them on the children. Expecting children to understand adult relationships or complex mental health issues isn’t fair and it’s a big burden to lump on a child. I have a friend who’s father did this, shared his suicidal thoughts, also got extremely angry with her which left my friend very frightened and guilty that she might be ‘causing’ or worsening his mental state. Which brings me to another more obvious one...blaming the child for everything"
"Maybe consider health reasons? Could be more motivating?  My wife did /r/paleo, and we both learned a lot about the health benefits of good food, and also the harm that bad foods were causing to our bodies. She lost 35kg. I got a huge remission in psoriasis (something medicine hadn't managed in 27 years of suffering from it), and it also helped a great deal with my mental health (if interested, google ""gut brain connection""). 

I wasn't even looking to loose weight (!) 

Anyway, just saying, if it's not just about appearance -and there may be health benefits you are not even aware of yet -  maybe more motivating and sustainable?"
"I've been through this and at first, it seems like a reason to not live.

It's exactly the opposite.

The fact that everything changes and nothing lasts forever is the reason to enjoy the time we have and try to spend time in the present, not in the past (regrets, insecurities, sadness) or the future (anxiety, worry, overplanning, perfectionism, false societal standards of ""success"").

Look at it this way. You go to a nice dinner and a movie with a friend. The next day, the movie is over and gone, and the dinner, well, we all know where that ends up. Does that mean the dinner and movie were pointless? Not if you enjoyed them.

This is really all it is about.

Now if you are dealing with pan or mental health problems, it can seem like enjoying life is impossible, but it's not. With a change in mental viewpoint and some help from the appropriate people, amazing change is possible.

"Mental illness does not always exist in isolation. Many people who are mentally ill are already extremely selfless, and expend all of their energy on other people. Many feel incredibly guilty for not having the time and resources to do MORE to help others, because they feel the need to prove that they deserve a place in the world. Yes, doing good for others can produce a good feeling. However, in a great number of cases, we need to tell people it’s okay to be “selfish.” Selfish is not a bad thing. We need to remind people that it’s okay to take time out to focus on themselves, and their recovery. To go to therapy, to practice self-care, to get enough food and rest. That it’s okay to spend that money on their medication rather than on someone else. You can’t be your best self for others if you are not your best self for yourself. You will just wear yourself down. 

There is certainly a balance, and a place for such selfless acts in recovery. But it is not a cure. And sometimes the best gift you can give the world is to take care of yourself, so that when you are stronger, you can go out and do good things in the world. "

"I was about to comment that it depends on the type of healthcare system... within the NHS I can't seem to find a reason for a real sudden drop as a patient... I mean, did they tell you ""Hey I have to let you go because there is rule x or y and you missed the appointment - I'm sorry""... ? I have a similar system but I never had any issues like that... sounds weird. Do you know if it was a decision from the doctor or an automatic ""drop"" from the system when you failed to show up!? If it is from the doctor themselves, that's weird. I have been dumped before with no warning whatsoever and it was the worst experience in my whole life, almost gave up on getting better. When I was on zyprexa I was a zombie, I totally understand not being able to function! Try to contact the services - write a letter (snail mail), send a copy over email and call them. I always cover every contact via multiple forms so they can't say ""Well we just did not know/we were not informed"" because you'll have multiple proof of contact. Explain the situation (the medication is in your record so you can certainly explain why you did not show up). And with those kinds of meds you really should have someone overlooking your mental well being, they have heavy side-effects and you should be looked out for! If you can get a therapist or a shrink outside of the NHS while they don't arrange you another doctor please do it! "
"Sometimes. 

I experience derealisation. Most indescribable feeling. 

It gives me a sense of reality feeling altered. Reality will feel unreal, and too real at the same time. It’s often involuntary paired with thoughts and epiphanies about existence and the nature of reality.

Out of no where it feels like reality becomes this really foreign thing. Theres a distinct feeling of time disappearing and an overwhelmingly powerful feeling  that there is only ever “now”. 

Other people lose their sense of having a conscience, they start to feel like inanimate objects. Makes it really unsettling to maintain small talk when your mind isn’t focused on the conversation topic at all. 

It’s isolating, when I find existence so bizzare, but everyone around me carries on with life as if it’s not bizzare. 

If I experience disassociation mid conversation, I can’t just say “I feel weird” to the other person. Especially when I work at checkouts at the supermarket lol. 

I become unintentionally aware of my body. 

My eyes, and how what I see is actually an image inside my head, not an image outside of my body like it appears to be. 

Also my movement. How simple it is, that a thought can move my limbs and facial expressions. 

The concept of having thoughts starts to become disorientating. It feels like they’re almost physical. It feels like they’re in the room with me. I mean this literally not figuratively. When I disassociate, it wouldn’t surprise me if someone could read my mind, my thoughts feel that physically there. 

Sounds can become distorted. I’m gonna try hard to explain what that means. So, as you know, in music, certain notes in a song portray certain emotions. For me mundane sounds, like cars driving by or the dishes being put away, will start to sound emotionally charged. And can sound morbid and disturbing. 

Personality goes out the window. I become aware of how everyone has an ego. What does it mean to act out of character when I created mine in the first place? Personality doesn’t physically exist so is that not reason enough it’s an illusion. 

I have the sensation of being an observer. I’m the observer of my thoughts not the creator. I’m the observer of my bodies sensations. I’m not my body. My body carries on when I die. Not the awareness. (That I know of) I’m the awareness. Not my personality or memories. 

I don’t know if I’m making sense lmao but anyway.

I think the fact i was already interested in science, space and philosophy has meant, when I started disassociating and experiencing these ideas first hand (eg. time being man made or conscience being an illusion), I start obsessively thinking about existence. 

It’s a benefit in the fact I’m no longer as phased by day to day stresses like work/bills, friend drama and family deaths. As they seem so irrelevant in the big scheme of things. (I don’t intend that to be a depressing outlook.)

The bad parts are when it makes me feel panicky and out of control. 

The best thing I’ve taken from it, is that I am the universe observing itself for no reason at all. Might as well try enjoy it. So am I fucked up or not? Who knows, who cares. "

"I did exactly what you are doing now. Was on Lexapro for years and switched to Wellbutrin. 

Wellbutrin is a different class of medication and so it is likely you will have a very different experience. Like others said, people have a wide range of reactions to it, so if it's been several weeks you may want to try something else.

Was the Lexapro working? Why did they switch you?"
"I did.  Wasn't trying to get pregnant though.  Celexa gave me bad headaches and muscle aches so my doctor switched me to Sertraline (Zoloft) at 100mg.  That was too high and I am better at 50 mg.  100 mg made me feel like Mr. Potato Head.

Now  Sertraline did cause my libido to crash but again, I am not trying to get pregnant.  Not saying that the same will happen to you though."

"I think going to see your doctor is the best thing you could do. Maybe somebody here has more insight but it does sound like there is a problem of some sort and doctors are there to help you work it out.

If this is something that hasn’t happened with another therapist then it is probably because this therapist is a good match. Things get messy and hard but a good therapist is going to do that with you. That kind of work is needed for therapy to be effective but your therapist is there to guide you through it. I know that feeling and I promise you it’s going to be all right.
That is one of the things AA teaches you. I only went to one meeting because of all the religious stuff they were shoving down our throats (I am an agnostic and believe there is something watching over us but I can't say what) but I know that making amends is part of it. I had to apologize to my family for all the stupid shit I did while I was drinking heavily. Good luck to you.
You can get better! I'm in my early 40's and I have been there. I'm finally in a great place. It took therapy with a great therapist I loved. We did EMDR therapy to get through some things. I finally found the right med combination which I think probably helped the most. I used the EMDR to get through my fear of losing people and death. It takes some work but you can get better.
"wow.. 7 weeks is a long time. How do you manage to do it? 
Did you guys set a specific time to resume contact or you are waiting till she is ready to contact you? 

I’m thinking of going no contact for maybe a week or 2 to reset things between us and for me to heal, but I’m also afraid that this will drastically change the way we feel about each other or just... everything? "
"I did feel that too, personally speaking. In my case, I had no one to talk to when I wanted to and I also isolated myself more and more thinking that nobody cares about me. Eventually, I grew apart from people around me. Also, anxiety and depression are very exhausting emotionally. They are draining. I found it extremely exhausting to be there and listen to my friends. But I know I wasn’t being a good friend and still tried. Every time I did that, I end up with an episode myself. So I just started consciously avoiding that. That’s my experience. But I would like to know too, if this could be explained and articulated better. "

"We are in an era where many more people who never were educated before, are more accepting and more receptive and sympathetic towards the idea of mental illness and people who suffer.  If you aren't there yet, and you have been turning the other cheek and not acknowledging or listening to the media, newspapers, or to other people or loved ones who suffer, you deserve to be scolded.  This isn't the dark ages where nobody knew a thing, or the 50's or 60's where you were practically demonized and frowned upon or 'faking it' for having a mental illness.  This boss was an absolute jerk and deserves every amount of scolding he can get."
"I mean, you didn’t “call it” because I didn’t say you were wrong or that everyone should try mindfulness, or continue if they don’t like it. I simply said that your opinion - like my opinion - does not apply to everyone. Just because you don’t find it helpful, doesn’t mean everyone does. Just because I do, doesn’t mean everyone should. It’s about finding a middle ground with your generalizations. You are basically saying everyone who uses mindfulness techniques is stupid and wasting their time, which is categorically incorrect and possibly damaging.

For example, I don’t think it’s healthy to be a vegan. I can find research to back me up. But if being a vegan is helping someone and making them feel better, it’s not up to me to say they’re wrong. 

Also, saying “called it” doesn’t make you smarter or your thoughts more valuable than anyone else’s. "
" i did this when i was 17-18. i had always had difficulty with school and being bullied and it felt like i was constantly so stressed out that i couldn't even enjoy my hobbies anymore and hadn't for a long time, so i just stopped going out of my room. of course my relationship with my family deteriorated. it never recovered actually, but now i see that they were never there for me, so it's not a real loss. it was always a pretense of normality, not true affection or anything like that.

 i used the time i gained to learn about the world and realized it was worse than i ever thought, but i started to see outside myself for the first time, which lessened my individual anxiety. unfortunately it also gave me an existential dread i'd never felt before. i'm 27 now and that's still there.

 anyway, at the same time that i was making all these realizations, i started to work out on my own and gained some weight, which helped me face the world. i don't think i would've done that if i had kept going to school or had a job, people that treat you like crap will start poking fun of any ""changes"" you go through - they want you to stay the same.

"Could be a lot of things. For my partner it was so bad that I was completely sure it was chronic fatigue syndrome. It turned out to be stress. Mostly work related, so the moment they found a way to cut that out, suddenly their tiredness dropped.

It's just a process of ruling out things. It's unlikely to be diet if he's eating according to his needs (""clean"" is a weird word for it, an optimal diet looks different for everyone and the alternative is not ""dirty""). Depending on the supplements it could still be a deficiency and blood tests are generally a good place to start, there are a number of causes that can be picked up in the blood, varying from the innocuous to the very serious. Anxiety is a source of stress which leads to fatigue so dealing with that in some form will be important. Depression can lead to tiredness in a lot of people so again, treating that will be important. Sleep *quality* matters just as much as how much sleep you get so a sleep study might be a good shout at some point.

There's a lot of potential causes and you just have to work with a doctor to tick them all off until hopefully you find the right answer."
"I actually was in a similar boat a couple years ago when I was in college. I got dumped by my 6 year gf and was in a pretty bad place. Started working on myself but realized I was actually terrible with women. I was just used to her because we were together since 8th grade. The pick up artist and redpill shit is stupid and full of narcissistic people. These people rarely have good relationships that are fulfilling and healthy so stay away. I would read the book called models. It Is about attracting women but not by manipulation or being an ALPHA male. Just by being your best self and finding a real relationship that’s fulfilling. To be honest true leaders ( or Alpha as redpill says)  are people who just know who they are and are confident with themselves. Not douche bags who think they’re the shit and need to put down other people to get ahead. This book helped me immensely and helped me find a girlfriend. Also has helped go on dates with a good amount of women. Cheers

PS. The key is getting to a place where you are fine with being rejected. Because it’s inevitable that this is going to happen. Read the book thank me later. "
"I am so sorry this is happening. I have a friend who is transitioning from female to male, another friend online who is also transitioning from female to male, have a cousin who is in a same sex marriage (and her mate just had a baby and they are absolutely happy together), and a daughter who is also in a same sex relationship (she is 19 and her girlfriend is 18 and they are both in different colleges right now) AND my best friend is bisexual, as am I...so I have so much empathy and love for people going through this and being true to who they ARE, not what society TELLS THEM what to be. I hope your mom was just bluffing. When our daughter came out as lesbian, my hubby wasn't too thrilled about it, but I welcomed both of her girlfriends (not at the same time) with open arms because I don't care who she loves, as long as that person is good to her (they both were). She has been with this current girlfriend for 2 years now and I am thrilled for them. When my friends told me they were transitioning, I was THRILLED for them! SO happy! I am happy for you too. :) Good luck to you with your transition and I hope things get better for you!"
"Sometimes we're fed this idea that men don't cry. Men are strong. Men don't feel emotions.   
It's all bullshit. Men are human. And those are human emotions. 
I don't know what you're going through, but if it's bothering you then you might want to see a therapist. 
What you're experiencing doesn't make you a psychopath (that's very different).  
I'm not a therapist or anything, but i could relate to some things you mentioned and i know it was because of my depression + a few toxic things I've experienced in the past.  
I used to think it was wrong for me to feel this way since other people who had similar experiences didn't. You don't choose what to feel. You don't go: ""oh i wanna feel sad/happy."" You just feel things and you can't help it most of the time. 
Depression is an illness caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Telling a depressed person to man up doesn't fix anything.  
If someone tells me to pull myself together and excepts my depression to be cured, I'd shoot them in the foot, tell them to toughen up and walk it off.... jk  
Sorry if this was all over the place. Feel free to PM me if you want someone to talk to. "

Abstract: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  There has been a long-standing controversy about the possibility that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants might induce suicidality in some patients. To shed light on this issue, this paper reviews available randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses of clinical trials and epidemiological studies that have been undertaken to investigate the issue further. The original clinical studies raising concerns about SSRIs and suicide induction produced evidence of a dose-dependent link on a challenge-dechallenge and rechallenge basis between SSRIs and both agitation and suicidality. Meta-analyses of RCTs conducted around this time indicated that SSRIs may reduce suicidal ideation in some patients. These same RCTs, however, revealed an excess of suicidal acts on active treatments compared with placebo, with an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.6–3.7). This excess of suicidal acts also appears in epidemiological studies. The data reviewed here make it difficult to sustain a null hypothesis that SSRIs do not cause problems in some individuals. Further studies or further access to data are indicated to establish the magnitude of any risk and the characteristics of patients who may be most at risk. "
"I wish I could properly express what I want to about this, but I can't find the right words. However, I do agree with what you said and I don't think what you said was invalidating just because it isn't someone else's perception of their own experience. People have different experiences with mental illness, and I would agree that romanticizing it possibly common. Sometimes it feels easier to ""wallow"" in it, or maybe even like your sadness/anxiety/pain/etc. is all you had, like only you understood you, kind of thing. I went to therapy about my anxiety some years prior getting on medication, and I remember admitting that I felt my anxiety was who I was, and that I didn't know who I would be without it and that scared me. In a way, I was afraid to let go of that ""demon"" because I had romanticized it as being just a personality trait that was making me who I am and I didn't know who I was without the ""demon."" 

Heck, I feel I identify with the quote, but in a way to mean yeah, I've felt that way, it wasn't a healthy way to think though. Though, I don't know, it almost sounds like the response of getting angry and saying you were invalidating her experience is in and of itself kind of proving your point. Like, they continue to romanticize their self harming past in some way. Not saying that in a negative or positive way, just in a, maybe they felt defensive since they kind of do romanticize it since it was/is a hard thing to have to unpack.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr : I think I agree with your take, and your interpretation isn't invalidating because it is just one way of many to interpret and feel about what that quote may be trying to convey."
"Keep your chin up! I have always believed everything happens for a reason. This coming from a clinically depressed, pessimistic, unlucky person. ��

I experienced something similar to you. I was depressed with my last job, it was extremely toxic and I could feel it slowly sucking the life out of me. I spent 2 years looking for other jobs. I finally found and interviewed for an amazing job. I was soooo ecstatic when they hired me! However, I had to go through a background check first, which I knew wouldn't be a problem. As I was still in background check, there was talk that they were going to have a hiring freeze. Eventually, that's exactly what happened and they couldn't bring me on board yet. I was so disappointed!! And my job at the time was already getting ready to take away my cubicle and parking card. I ended up being there for another miserable year before I was able to start my new job. By that time, I was already struggling every day as 3 years of unchecked depression was taking a heavy toll on me, mentally, physically, and spiritually. It took months in my new job before I started feeling physically and mentally healthy again.

I lost faith during the wait time. Everything was out of my control, nothing going my way. However, as I look back, that experience has made me stronger. I felt like I hit rock bottom, and now nothing that happens to me is nearly as serious as that, and so I don't get upset over the small stuff anymore. 

Basically, I want to say it'll all be worth it in the end. You end up learning more about yourself and when you look back, you can tell yourself you were strong and made it through tough times. "
"I don't think it's common, but I am the same way. I say think because I do not really understand people and what drives the things they do and say and feel. I have learned to act like I conform in situations that I need to - like job interviews and dealing with coworkers (though that gets old after a while and some of my true colors will come through if I feel I can get away with it or have nothing to gain by continuing to pretend). Though, one thing that is very hard for me is fake smiling like for a picture. I can fake a smile during a conversation like during an interview while I am talking about how suitable I am for the job, though. I tend to have a flat affect, so sometimes I have to fake smile even if what I am saying is genuine, if that is what it is going to take to get me what I want. 

You spoke of emotions, and I too have a hard time feeling real, deep emotions for real people and real scenarios except for things like hearing about sex trafficking rings and other situations of enslavement, oppression, and abuse. I can also become emotionally invested in fake people, meaning for example characters in a television series. I couldn't watch the final episode of Lost for days because I was so sad that I would be losing them (yes, it sounds ridiculous) yet in real life I can have a great work best friend or something like that and when I move or change jobs they just cease to exist  and that's that. I think a lot of *that* has to do with my possibly being schizoid (undiagnosed but suspected).

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't sound like you (or I) share much in common with sociopaths other than an ability to wear a mask. From my understanding, sociopaths are more like con artists and more extreme in their manipulations, both in the positive and negative things they say and do. They also seem to put more effort into it, and get a kick out of the act of manipulating others. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"While I get where you're coming from, and I understand what everyone else is saying, one thing to consider is that mental health diagnoses are not a science the same way physical health diagnoses are. If you look in the DSM (the big book of mental health illnesses), each illness has a bunch of symptoms, but people only need to meet a certain amount in order to be diagnosed with it. For this reason, people with depression, for example, can and do present differently. With physical health, you treat the illness. With mental health, you treat the person.

Mental health diagnoses also have a lot of preconceived notions, or stigmas, about them. So I also agree that people can internalize the diagnoses, and hold onto or take on more characteristics that theu associate with the diagnosis. It's called labelling theory, and it happens. When people think of their mental health diagnosis, many of them don't say ""I have depression"", for example, they say ""I am depressed."" You will likely never hear a person with cancer say ""I am cancer."" This is problematic, because we use language to make sense of our experience, and if we internalize a mental health diagnosis, it can slow our progress.

But I also understand your desire to be able to put a word or label to what it is you are experiencing. I think a diagnosis can be helpful for this, but it is a double-edged sword and one that an individual needs to be mindful of.

However, if he is a clinical social worker he is likely not able to diagnose; that needs to be done by a doctor or psychiatrist. Also, depending on where he works, some social workers/counselors are prohibited by even giving an opinion, as this is a medical condition and they are not medical practitioners. So perhaps he believes in what he is saying about labels (and he likely does, as the mental health profession is heading that way), but perhaps he just also can't offer an opinion. "

"Yeah, I think I will. Therapists that are in net work and not awful are just so hard to find lol. But it's worth the effort :)"
"You are so arrogant that you believe it is impossible for you to make anyone sad, no matter how much you hurt them.

Pathetic."
don't worry about it. if you do pass it on to your child you'll be a supportive parent who isn't going to abandon their child.
"its ok after it happens a few times youll get used to it and it just becomes a part of life, like getting dizzy or passing out"
"And, you can always reach out to me through messaging. I won’t think you’re a Debbie downer. I think I know how you feel. I’m such an extrovert in front of my friends and then I go home and there’s no one I can talk to about my depression because I don’t want to come off as a burden to anyone. So, I find myself on Reddit. Lol... maybe we can be Debbie downers together. "
Antidepressants work to kick up the amount of serotonin (neurotransmitter that's responsible for happiness and well being) your brain produces... When you come off an antidepressant suddenly or even slowly your brain is producing less and less of this neurotransmitter which is making you feel less happy... So yes it can be attributed to suicidal thoughts while coming off them...
"I chat with her regularly to check in to see how she is doing. She is actually the older one in the relationship (22) and  I have told her multiple times that she needs to do what is best for her. She shouldn't be in a relationship like this at all. I don't blame her if she wants to break up with him. I would too. But, she is currently by his side doing her best to help, so IDK. "
"I guess i’m more afraid of who it’ll turn me into. I go in for my final diagnosis on tuesday, but I think my diagnosis is going to be Depression and ADD. I’ve never taken any medications before last month (wellbutrin), so the way I am now is the only “me” I know of. I guess i’m more-so nervous about who i’ll be with the meds when I am prescribed them in the future. "
"I have tinnitus as well and occasionally it does seem to alter or mix with other sounds to make an odd or out of place sound.

Also, sleep deprivation can give me visual hallucinations so auditory hallucinations don't seem far fetched. Honestly, it doesn't sound like you have anything to worry about. You can always mention it to your gp or psych next time you go for reassurance. "
"These beliefs you have that love is a conditional thing, as in, I will only love you if you are XYZ, and your guilt over having not held up your end of the bargain, that’s irrational, and it’s unfair, and it’s unhealthy. And what I’m concerned about is someone who is, let’s say, stoking that fire for their own personal gain. Why does she know about your private journal?"
"Wow, and I thought my dad was bad for denying my problems and gaslighting me, calling me a mypochondriac. But your mother is worse, that's no way to treat someone you care about. Your illness is 100% not your fault, that's like blaming a child for getting leukemia. Mental illness is horrible, nobody would choose it, you sure didn't. Be kind to yourself and get the help you need. "
"&gt; I started to realise that maybe I'm just not suited for the world I live in; not because I'm unhappy but more because I disagree with the way we live and what we live for etc. 

I do believe that with over a million suicides, worldwide every year that there may be something to this other than slapping a ""mental illness"" label on it.  I wonder if maybe the Law of Natural selection isn't at work here?  I dunno.

One of my relatives is in law enforcement (US) and he sees quite a few suicides every year.  He says, in many cases, they are just stupid tragedies but even he admits that in some cases, people are just ""out of moves"". "
"Continue to see doctors about this. Like the others said, it could be anxiety, maybe severe. It could be another type of disorder if you only see them when you are tired. A psychiatrist is the one who knows the diagnostic books and would be the one to diagnose you. You can ask your primary care for a referral. Psychiatrists are not like normal doctor appointments, so I don't know if that will help you. At their appointments, you sit in normal chairs, they sit behind a desk and talk to you. That's how it's always gone for me, anyways. It is not normal to have any hallucinations unless you have not slept for a few days I do believe."
"I was too when I had it, I still am, I am a terrible procrastinator. 

You should not be afraid to talk to your parents, they should be understanding. If you don't feel comfortable talking to you family then perhaps you could talk to a friend or school counsellor if you have access. 

I know its scary to face your fears, its terrible, and its much easier to distract yourself and push it deeper. But it will never go away that way. Stagnancy creates anxiety, but when you start moving it will be relieving, I promise.

You'll get through this, we are here for you, the first step is the worst, but once you get going it will get better."
"It was a super long road to get to a point of feeling decent and stable. I had a bunch of therapists I hated. Eventually I found one that was perfect for me. I was on antidepressants for 7/8 years or so. I think the combination of having a kick ass doctor and an amazing therapist really set me in the right direction. I also moved across the country and got out of some pretty toxic environments, stopped drinking as much, started to rely more heavily on healthy coping skills such as baths and working out. I definitely still have days where my anxiety is overwhelming and/or I feel dumpy and dark, but it’s nowhere near where it was "
"Thank you so much for your reply, it's nice to hear from someone who's been through similar and come out the other side. I'm so sorry you had to go through that, life really does like to test us, but I'm glad you made it through and things are much better for you now! 

I know that it won't be like this forever even though it feels like it, so I've just got to keep fighting the good fight. I'm taking today to just refresh my mind and hopefully get back in the game this weekend. I am determined to achieve what I want and overcome this terrible mindset I've got myself in!

Thanks again, and I wish you all the best with your life :) "
"Funny thing is BPD is ***still*** far better understood and far more accepted, with more treatment options available, than the other cluster B personality disorders, which is saying a lot. It's the ""good prognosis diagnosis"" with more research on it than any other personality disorder.  

Imagine trying to get help for something like an NPD diagnosis, or trying to be open about it with someone close. Wonder if the other PDs will be looked at the same way BPD is now in 20 years? People acted as if it was untreatable, everyone with it was horrible, and incapable of voluntarily seeking help in the past, too.  

And not only DID, but dissociative disorders in general are basically completely unheard of to most. DID is at least well known; people just only know nonsense about it, and it's OK to misrepresent as a stigmatising plot device. Imagine a movie like Split, but about depression!"
"&gt; i'm managing the salon by myself at 19, in charge of all the inventory, financial reports, etc...and they gave me a dollar raise ($11) ($10 an hour they gave me below what the posted wage was)

Median wage for Salon Manager in the entire USA is 12$. So, for 19 out of school, you're not far off the mark. Figure you're getting resume material before leaving them.

&gt;I started as retail in the salon as a part time job because it was easy to go to school and work in the same building, since it's owned by the same person ... 9 months later i'm managing the salon by myself at 19, in charge of all the inventory, financial reports, etc... I open the school.

OK. So you're putting in 40 hours at Salon, and 20 hours at school, and they're owned by the same person? You're effectively working overtime and not getting fucking paid for it. It's scummy as fuck. Research if this is a legit loophole in overtime state law or not (which it almost sounds like it is). If you can find leverage with that, get a fucking raise. You're literally doing their job for 11$/hr.

Why are you doing the 20 hour bit, and not just working in the Salon 40 hours?"
"My pleasure.

I believe medication is not required for everyone.  They tried CBT alone for me, at first.  I only began medication after several weeks of unsatisfactory progress with my symptoms.  My father also suffered from depression, and they said it is possible to have biological components, so they offered the medication as an option, if I wanted to try it (I did not, at first, but eventually and thankfully did).

Based on your situation, I'd say you may want to start with a therapist?  Mine is not a psychologist, so she does not handle my prescriptions.  She referred me to a psychologist for the medication, and he only handles that part of my care - he relies on her for notes about my progress and meets with me around once a month to make sure everything is still ok (it was more often at the beginning, to make sure the medication worked as desired and to deal with any side effects).  The therapist visits may be more acceptable in your culture/region?  

I can confirm that CBT is the method my therapist has used to treat me.  I would have a hard time arriving at some of the breakthroughs by myself and without her input, though."
"Create clear boundaries up front. As an example, I had a few friends who called me at random times. It wasn't okay and I ended up putting do not disturb except for priority on in the hours I need to sleep and relax.

I wish now I'd been polite but firm up front as there was a lot of push back by two people and one just rarely calls now. (Calling half an hour after I've fallen asleep so they can have long drawn out conversations about their dates or multiple texts at 0530 am expecting a response because *they* wake up early. No.)

But I've seen that firm and polite usually works. If they push those boundaries, again be firm and polite but put the responsibility back on them. For example someone who doesn't like to be touched keeps getting hugged by another person:

""I'm glad you're happy to be in my company but you know I don't like being touched and you need to find another way to express your joy so that I can enjoy your company as well. Right now I don't feel comfortable because you are touching me and you're ignoring my feelings about it. That doesn't make me enjoy our time together.""

""Why do you feel the need to do something I've asked you not to do?""

Obviously a little less formal and wooden but adjustable.

I've found once a boundary is set most people will respect it. These are people you want to be around. Some people won't. They'll make up excuses like forgetting constantly, or dismissing it because it's silly. Those are the toxic people who are easy to spot.

If you have one but need to/want to continue being in their space then it's fine to offer them consequences. ""James, you've contacted me repeatedly about the report, which I told you I would have done by 02:00 pm. Unfortunately, you constantly interrupting me has forced me to stop my work just so I can answer you and has wasted a lot of time and you are causing me to run behind. I will be ask my boss to mediate how we can better communicate together. Until then I will try my best to have this done first thing tomorrow unless I am otherwise interrupted.""

""Dad, I love that you want to show the world that we are a perfect family on Facebook but I've told you multiple times that I don't want my picture online. From now on I'm going to hide my face in any future photos taken by you or that you may have access to and have started to report all the photos you have off me to facebook as you've put thunk up against my will. It's sad that you feel your wishes to slow outsiders that we are a happy family override my need for safety; is something you'll have to address in yourself before we can move forward. I hope you can work it out for yourself before December, as you love Christmas, but again, I do not feel safe and will not be showing my face until I do.""

Boundaries are fluid and other people are allowed to have them too. The people you want to be with will work with you to establish a relationship where everyone is comfortable"
"what you are interpreting as belittling is not that at all. Just for one moment imagine you were a person who has battled with MH issues, reading your request. It looks last minute and superficial. The idea that someone who has battled MH is going to be helped by footy kickabouts seems belittling to the suffering and support needed.

I campaign on MH issues it is a subject close to my heart. Its a very complex issue. Unfortunately MH neglect has for the most part been normalised. The lack of services, the poor treatment people with MH conditions or injuries receive is barbaric cruel and for the most part swept under the carpet.

At this point most of the MH main stream charities have been corporatised and sanitised by the leader of the charge Paul Farmer of Mind. Mind is working very closely with government to implement in job centre counselling or as its been dubbed back to work therapy.

The is in effect a hostile environment for MH sufferers. Charities have been essentially brought off. Mind as a courting provider of services to government are no longer a charity for the community but a contractor with business commitments which trump their stated aims.

The MH profession have been fighting a PR battle for many years to maintain any credibility. They have become nothing more than script jockeys for big pharma. They are battling amongst them selves on which type of care and treatment models work. In an nut shell on one side you have those that see long term therapy as a working model, and the other side who are quite happy to implement one size fits all solutions such as CBT (as they are more profitable business models). Ultimately the losers in this are the patients who are failed systematically. Then blamed for the failing with narratives such as refusing to engage. The is a small minority in the MH profession that genuinely fight the MH service users corner but in the main the first thought is not of the service users need but the people employed in the system.Its driven by self interest and not patients needs.

In such a hostile environment you have to be very mindful of own goals. Any narrative that focuses on self treatment the framing of taking responsibility for your injuries. Anything that leads the viewer to conclude mental health is something that will be fine if they just pull them selves together and get out a bit, undermines the seriousness of peoples suffering and the notion its a lifestyle choice fixed by a bit of modified behaviour.

I support people trying to highlight these issues. I think making film in its self is a very positive therapeutic thing. I hope your film works for you. Please just be mindful of letting anyone off the hook and giving an opt out to those that fail MH sufferers.

As someone who has battled with the result of parental suicide childhood abuse then years of gas lighting from community mental health teams who simply dont give a fuck if they leave you in a groundhog day holding pattern for years and years. I read your post with interest its only when i got to the footy bit it made my eyes roll hard. surely you can appreciate that could seem patronising. been suffering for years battling where you? how about jumpers for goal posts that'll sort you out.

if the notice wasnt so short I would of asked around, But we are actually holding a meeting today of MH service survivors fighting back against a totally fucked MH care system... So wont be available."

"It depends on the province. Where i am in Ontario, the govt keeps cutting funding in favor of keeping taxes low for businesses."
I’m exactly like this. I can’t seem to do better and it’s really been bugging me and making me feel worthless and crazy.

"Sorry you are having such a hard time finding a therapist who can help.

Have you been able to see an actual psychiatrist (MD)?"
"Thank you, I’m trying to help him see that I care about him too much to hold him back even if that means I become irrelevant "
That actually sounds scary af. Like that crying girl that when you get close she turns into a witch and fucking murks your as*.
That's why you need to see a therapist at the very least. They might be able to help you in regards to your personality issues.
There are unwritten rules. You're not supposed to become attached to public service givers. I'm sorry this has happened to you.
"Well, just know that we are all here for you. There are a lot of people who understand and would like to help. Take care. &lt;3"

to my last reply* i took the ondansetron right after i woke up feeling that way so it’s been long since i’ve taken that too
"

What's the impulse telling you about what is important to you?

What are you fighting to defend by doing this?

Maybe think about what's at stake here - what the core issue is that matters to you - and then figure out a clear, honest path of communication to negotiate for it.

Just a suggestion. I hope you find a result that helps you and your husband move forward constructively"
"Divorce isn’t simple. There is no “while you have the chance”. He may still love her. It’s possible he has some sort of issues that make it harder for him to respect her feelings and it’s OP’s decision to make, once they get counselling, whether she wants a divorce or not. But if after a good amount of counselling, he still does that, then yeah, divorce might be smart."
"I'm doing better. Every day is a dice roll man. Dome days I'm extremely bored doing the same thing I'm not too bored doing other days. It's never good, it's just not consistently bad.

I did literally nothing but watch YouTube videos and browse Reddit. I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't to the point of wanting to kill myself like other days are. This really is one strange condition."
"It took me 8 hours to actually tell her after I had decided it was the day I would tell her, my heart was thumping the whole time like I had just ran non stop for a mile. I definitely was tired. I done the same thing after I told her lol I just looked at my ceiling, not feeling much and thinking about how my future might be getting a whole lot better. I’m really glad I done it. "
"My husband and I used to have the same problem on both ends, we went to counseling and figured out how to always communicate and check in with each other.
Know that you are going to be okay, I feel your pain. Surround yourself with friends and fill your schedule so you're not alone a lot of the time. Maybe ask friends to let you walk their dogs, that has helped me to clear my mind"
"Seems like you were doing better before you started taking meds, but then again we don’t know the whole story and even why you went to get therapy in the first place. If you feel like you were doing better before the drugs I would maybe lay off them for awhile and see the changes and if it’s negative take them again. 


Also for the edit, that’s normal dude no need to worry."
"Yeah of course, it's hard to explain the feeling of love in a universal way.  I just know that I've never felt this strongly about anyone else before romantically or platonically and in my heart I would sincerely hope he's in my life for as long as I live.  He's one of the only people I've been able to consistently depend upon and isn't just my boyfriend, he's also my best friend."
"Yeah, definitely keep an eye out for stuff like that when you're on new meds or even when your prescription changes. Talk to your doctor about it for sure! I was on Prozac and was fine for the whole first month and then my fourth (and LAST) week of taking it, those really horrible, horrible episodes kept happening to me. Once it was out of my system, they stopped. Medicine is wild"
"You need to set up an appointment with a psychiatrist or a psychologist. That doctor sounded careless but he wasn't lying about yoga and breathing exercises possibly helping. I meditate and exercise to help with my tantrums, but of course, ymmv. If you feel like you need to see a therapist, see a therapist. It never hurts to try different things to see what works and what doesn't."
"In 2014 I was in a really bad place. I was addicted to hallucinogenics and was convinced my roommates were talking to me through the wall. I was forced to get therapy after doing something ridiculously stupid and 6 months into therapy I was taken an hour from where I lived to go to the hospitals crc. There I was diagnosed with severely manic bipolar disorder with psychotic features. I got medicated and I was in school at the time and the semester after I was diagnosed I got straight A’s repaired my relationships with my family and got a fresh start in a new state. Now I have an associates, a beautiful wife and 3 lovable puppers. "
"Let me just start off by saying, it seems to me you have done an AMAZING job of helping her out so far! She probably appreciates it, or feels too crap or doesn't know how to say she does. 

As someone in a similar place as your gf, i know she needs a support system (key word). You're doing your best but you really can't do it alone, you're just going to wear yourself down and feel worse in the end. Does she have any good family who can help? Or professional help, such as a psychologist? I think these could really benefit her, and by extension you at the moment.

If you want to talk or ask qus about anything else feel free to PM me "
"OP i understand you have a connection to him and he’s  helped you out. but he is displaying extremely emotionally abusive behavior and it could easily escalate to physical abuse at any time. 

he may be self aware at times and realize what he’s doing. but if he refuses to go to therapy like you said in your original post- he doesn’t want to change. he tells you he wants to change so you stick around a bit longer. but he’s not going to put the work in. 

you might be all he has, but you are not obligated to be his savior. especially if you have your own mental health issues. you can’t drown yourself to save somebody else. "
"Do your bf know about this? You're just needy, and that's totally fine. You need someone to be around you. I think you just need someone to talk to. 

You can also try listen to podcast to sleep. I works for me. I'm a needy person myself too. I'm not social active and I will get depressed time to time.

One way I handle it is to have a passion. I like to drive.I have to drive around 30 minutes  to my college. I usually either drive it slowly and blast the music in high volume or drive like a mad man when there's  no one around. Reddit also is a place to let me  have a little satisfaction of social activities.

If you really need someone besides you, ask your boyfriend. Tell him to come and hang with you frequently. But be ensure that he's someone can be trusted. Not to mean anything bad, but always understand who you're hanging out with.

Good luck!

If nothing works, tell me again!"
"Thank you for the positive reinforcement! =)

I guess what I mostly want is 

A: confirmation as to the disposition of my private record (shredded, lost, on someone's desk).

B: for the staff to do better in the future with other patients (if this was a matter of negligence or carelessness)

C) an apology wouldn't hurt, but an apology without the other parts is kinda empty.

As for the doctor who may have misplaced the record, she's not my regular psychiatrist, so I'll probably not see her again anytime soon. Hopefully, it's like the other comment suggested where it's still ""in process,"" because that would mean they know where it is.

My name is pretty uncommon (I'm probably the only person living in this county with my last name). I can't possibly get mixed up with another person, so if someone saw it and recognized my name, I truly believe they'd see me differently. Luckily, I can't think of a scenario where that would actually happen.

Now if I still lived in the town where I grew up...this happening there could actually cause an issue. But it's not. So I'm just gonna file a complaint and hope that they're more diligent next time."
"You appear to have misunderstood a core aspect of the article, particularly the argument about the social origins of insecurity. The author  immediately clarifies the claim with a discussion about women and minorities in professional settings. Your rebuttal is  ""if people are outcomes of their social context, then everybody is an outcome of the same thing  "" .   It doesnt address whats being said.

&amp;#x200B;

I second /u/[Qeltar\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Qeltar_) 's statement that some kids are insecure. Sure their insecurities are a bit less complex than adults, but there are some really insecure kids out there. Google 'attachment disorder' and that should fill you in on some of the developmental aspects. Your blanket statement ""young children are never insecure"" is patently incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the impression from your formulation here that you are not well read in Anthropology or Sociology. I suggest these are essential disciplines to have at least a basic  understanding of if you want to face off against people writing in the 'social' space, ie, the social sciences, and not come off second best.

He will get way too overly upset over bad parenting though. The way he describes how he would treat his kids if he had any sounds way too protective and strict. He also says that I abuse my dogs because I accidentally over fed them one time and because they both have come from bad backgrounds they are terrified to be put on leashes so cant let them out of my garden to go on walks.
"I find that time blocks help me.  If a time during the week is set aside for homework, and if you don't have homework, reading, chances are you'll do it.

I just want to say I made it quite a ways down the comments here and I'm so proud that every single one of you is supporting the mom as well as her kids. I get so sick of people saying it's selfish/the coward's way out and slamming parents for contemplating suicide but it's such an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness that you really can feel like they'd be better off without you.

They have protocols, but you have to ask yourself the question what's going to happen if nothing changes. If he has no one, and friends/family can't help, that's probably where he needs to be. Because left to his own devices, from what you're saying here, he could well end up dead."
"You know I've been feeling the same way you do for a long time.
Until a ladyfriend of mine teste me one morning. She Was in panic and just Texte my name in all caps a few times.

She had dreamt I die and woke up crying for half an hour. Up to that point I too thought nobody would care if I died.

Trust me people care. They are just too affraid to show it under normal circumstances."
"&gt; If you make progress with one aspect of your life-say learning ways to reduce the severity of your distress, you are pretty much making progress with all of the diagnosis boxes at the same time.

Reading that made me feel a lot better, because when I got diagnosed it felt like another problem was added to my to do list of issues I need to fix, and that all the progress I've made was useless because I felt like I'd have to start over agin because of my new diagnosis, it was making me feel extremely overwhelmed. But seeing it like how you described makes everything feel way more manageable and I feel a little more in control now."
"I can understand that. Meditation has a lot of stigma associated with it and a lot of nonsense as well. I don't bother with all the spiritual stuff and just see it as a way to practice looking at things from a safe, comfortable, healthy perspective.

I do really encourage you to try it again as it seems to work really well for so many people. I guess just don't tell your dad about it. :)

Here's a short video I watched that made me ""believe"" in meditation: https://youtu.be/vo_VANW35b0

Either way, sounds like you have your own system, and having a daily routine that requires focus and attention is no doubt doing you a world of good."
"Imagine a world where recreational drugs are regulated, easily available and manufactured in FDA certified labs, free of adulterants. I imagine booze sales drop, what, fifty percent? Sixty-five? Seventy? It's a drug with so few positives that if it were to disappear tomorrow I truly believe the world would be a far better place. I can't say that about MDMA, LSD, psilocybin , hell even opiates are less of a detriment to your health than booze. Alcohol and meth, the two drugs that literally destroy grey matter - that shit don't come back either. Anyway, good on ya darlin' . . . your liver and brain cells are totally psyched right now."
"It's hard to understand since it sounds so strange to be so fascinated with something so destructive. I totally get that, and no offense was taken. :)  


It's a sickness, for sure. I could try to get all psychological about what may cause this (biological causes? trauma in childhood or in adolescence when it usually starts?) but I just know I had a crappy childhood and a lot of other mental health issues, and that seems to be a common thread among people like me. Fire is comforting to me. I don't desire to destroy anything, but I do desire to see that sweet, sweet flame. Unfortunately, the former happens when the latter is done. :("
"Sounds like the classic signs of depression OP

If you have a family doctor, that’s a great place to start 

If you are at school, nurse/counselling is a great place to start

Don’t be overwhelmed about the journey to feeling better. One little step at a time. Like maybe between now and Sunday you take a nice bath, or a quick shower with some music in the background. And just that nothing more nothing less. Small bite size goals and just keep at it. 

If you have questions or need someone to rant at, feel free to send me a PM, I’ve gone through more then a couple depressive episodes in life and have found a way out each time. "
"Personal story, cause that's all I've got.

I would say about 5 years ago I was at a job I hated, I was having trouble at home with both the kids and the husband. Everything was making me cry. I was useless and couldn't do anything right. There were moments of triumph but mostly there was frustration, terror and sadness. 

This went on for a few years. I would say that about 18 months ago, I felt so miserable and backed up against a wall that I was seriously considering final solutions. I was nervous all the time, and I was crying more days than not. I had severe anxiety and was just basically existing instead of living. I wasn't doing anything constructive at all. 

In desperation I called into work and told them that I needed to take some time. I didn't know if I was going to get fired, but I was prob so close to that anyways that I didn't really care. Honestly, I thought taking a ""stress leave"" might keep them from firing me because they'd be afraid of the lawsuit. 

I was put on Short term disability through our benefits and forced to go to the doctor and the psychologist. I was put on meds. It took about 4 months of CBT and meds for the clouds to break, but once they did, it was amazing. I went back to work and actually like being here! I realized that most of my negative perception was in my brain. 

I'm not going to lie and say that I never have depressive episodes or panic attacks any more. I do. I still try and avoid unpleasant things. I'm not perfect by a long shot. 

BUT... I don't cry daily, in fact I prob don't even cry monthly. I'm not afraid to live. I can deal with the unpleasantness that happens. I can even deal with trauma. It will pass. I have the tools. 

So, in my experience, Yes, I have gotten better. Not perfect, but better. 

PLEASE PLEASE PM me if you want to talk further, or if there is anything I can do. This applies for anyone that might be reading this. &lt;3"
"15, I hate my life because of me. The last years I felt like I always fail. I have cars on body because of my selfharm addiction."
Amen to this...though I always drank alone and pretty much 7 days a week. -\_- How foolish I was then. Glad I kicked it for good!
Congratulations!  I just had my first appointment too.  I think committing to it is the hardest part... and we did that!  Go us!
Don’t do it you don’t wanna take innocent lives imagine if that was someone you loved and they shot them you sick fuck ��
I'm sure having a schedule and calendar will help you tackle your inner challenges better too. Feel free to TALK. We are here. :)
Like they don’t think you’re bipolar and want to take you off meds? Bipolar people need to be medicated ����‍♀️
"No, personally its just hard for me to keep my emotions in check, I get mad really easily, and I can't remember things very well "
Thanks. Never would I have thought that at 47 I would be diagnosed with that...but here I am. I hope you have a fantastic day. :)
Therapists aren't there to take your side and tell you you're right. You should re-evaluate what you're looking for from therapy.
What area of California? For what diagnoses or symptoms are you looking to treat? Are you looking for a specific type of therapy?
"Why do you want to boost serotonin, specifically?

Yeah its much jarder to fix the problem from inside the problem. Some space would help and allow you to build your energy back up

"learning is not something i care about right now, it’s that a physically cannot function here. i feel like i’m losing myself "
"sure i'm quite certain of the ""its everyone else's fault"" from her rubbed off on me. but no this bitch is a cunt. simple as that."
"I also want to add, i wasted most of my youth in the grips of the same worries you mention. It controlled every aspect of my life. It was crippling.
You dont have to live like that.
If you get the chance, get out of the environment which dictates this self-doubt all the time. 
I went to New Orleans; its the last place, imho, where people are supported to be themselves and flaunt it."
"I have been taking those meds daily for 8 years. I need them and cannot function without them. They matter a lot more than what I originally thought for my well-being and I never want to go back to the mental state I was 8 years ago. I don't want to go back to my original weight, I just would like to lose 30 lbs approximately, not more than that and be able to stabilize that weight."
"I think it's abuse. He's passively aggressively wearing you down. Maybe he's not happy in the relationship, feel trapped? Maybe he has a little bit of a vicious side to him and he likes to torture you, but while getting away with it?

Keep calling him on it.dont let it happen. But more importantly it could be part of a pattern (him getting angry, silent treatment, gaslighting, etc.)"
"I'm definitely going to give it more time - totally agree.

Just hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel. My wife takes it too and her side effects were similar to yours, she just had to lay down for around 30 minutes for the first week of taking it and is fine now. My side effects are just so violent it makes me want to quit the drug, but the benefits are far too great to quit."
"I'm weird but I think there is nothing wrong with thoughts like that or being depressed or anxious. It's just like being happy but you just feel bad instead of good. No reason to change that it is what it is. Anyway, some of your thoughts are in line with spiritual beliefs like this world being real or not. But the thoughts can still be distressing. Anyway, I wish you luck and peace"
"I've been to mental hospitals 4 times in my life. I can't say whether or not they work. Because it's different for every person. But I know that after my last visit there, I never want to go back. 

The one's I've been to have had support groups, activities and therapy sessions. But besides that, they're pretty boring. You spend most of your time either laying in bed or watching TV."
"Its an irrational fear. I had a really bad experience after eating a ""strong"" edible and had some dreams about people lacing food and drinks at a party with LSD. I used to smoke weed a lot but never did anything stronger for fear of losing control. I just have heard that LSD is a LOT stronger then weed and I've felt pretty paranoid and out of control on large amounts of THC before. "
"Just want to echo what others have said - you're not truly alone because we can relate to you. It's a horrible situation to be in, but we are here and there are many other places you can find support.

You did the right thing by posting here and you'll find that nearly everyone who responds to you will want to help and support you. We really do want to make things better for you. :)"
"Thanks for sharing. I feel a lot of that, too. Nice to not feel alone but I'm sorry you're going through so much anxiety &amp; depression. I totally get the ""talking makes me feel better which belies the seriousness of the sadness"" part. I love my lazy days, then hate myself for them later. I can relate all too well. Neeeeeed coffee but I get so on edge. Life is really fucking hard."
"They're an adult, and we pretty much factually know what a couple of their issues are. We've done a lot of work and research into repeatedly setting them up for success in life, only for them to just... Seemingly choose to grasp failure from the jaws of victory and force all of us to start over. However, that's a good start, I'll look more into social workers, I forgot they existed."
"This makes so much sense!! 

Sometimes I think I give so much to others because I try to be the person I wish I had for myself. But, you’re right... and unless I ask, I can’t exactly expect people to read my mind and help me (although wouldn’t that be nice!). 

Maybe it is a little bit of pride and ego. I think it’s mostly just fear of being let down. 

Thank you SO much!!! "
"Wow, this is amazing! Thank you so, so much for sharing it here where I would see it, to Hanna for making it, and to all of you who were in it. 

I usually feel even more alone after watching those corporate MH awareness things, because they never seem to relate, but this is the complete opposite effect. I feel reassuringly human, and that I am in good company. Just... thank you. :)"
hey I smoked weed and jerked off today too and I’m supposed to be looking for work. I would consider that taking care of yourself and if you go to therapy thats takin care of yourself too. Dont be too hard on yourself.. people say that ALL the time to me and it doesnt mean shit but try telling yourself (“dont be so hard on yourself” in the mirror or whatever works for you) ..
"I had an episode or several rather where my view was kinda distorted, I believed I was the son of Satan, coincidences reinforced my beliefs and I believed I was able to curse or hex people and those who had wronged me suffered.
It got to the point where i felt I had to reward the power or that there was going to be an event that was inevitable which involved harming people.
I didnt tell my doctor or therapist the extent of the psychosis but brushed upon it 
I was using cocaine at the time to help with a brakeup (I instigated to protect her from what I was becoming) and the death of a close relative 
Was a very dark period of my life "
"You know, I once talked to a psychiatric community nurse who was angry that more women than men are diagnosed with BPD when it's supposed to be a rare illness, and she was convinced that what is diagnosed as BPD isn't actually BPD at all, but usually CPTSD. A friend of mine has literally just had this happen to her: misdiagnosed BPD, gone back to therapy, found out it's CPTSD. 

It is so difficult to know who to trust, but once you do, it's awesome to have a therapist who's actually got your best interests at heart. I really hope you get a diagnosis that you feel fits you, and appropriate help for the things you're struggling with. X"
"yes. anxiety &amp; depression is the new normal for millennials &amp; gen z. that is part of why mental health is losing its stigma, tough, so it's a double edged sword. learning about my own mental health issues (complex ptsd or developmental trauma disorder) i have learned that trauma is still very difficult to understand in the field of psychology and many strong doctors of it are theorizing that virtually all mental illness (aka NEUROSIS) stems from trauma. that is why so many ""disorders"" are often more stigmatizing because they can actually be grouped under the umbrella of c-ptsd. but what do i know. just interesting, that's all"
"I’ve been here in your shoes before. It feels absolutely shitty and I’ve wanted to kill myself over it because I simply just couldn’t put up with all of the constant bullying from others that comes with ignorance to obesity. I hated it so much, I swallowed my pride, bought a retro fitness membership, and kept hitting the treadmill. And from there and that alone, a Phoenix rose from the flames. My whole point is, this kind of motivation comes from within. Granted it isn’t easy to dig it out. It all happens with time. Doesn’t matter how long it takes. All that matters is that the message relays to you sooner than later, one way or another. Also don’t let others opinions get to you, because who the fuck are they? Do they know your struggle, Do they know what it’s like, are they more motivated than you? Why does it matter. They set the bar, now it’s your turn to raise it. "
"Hi! Do you have the same sort of problems with non-romantic relationships? I'm wondering how much of this might come from being with the wrong person.

I don't doubt that there are other issues at play here, but being with somebody who isn't right for you can bring out a lot of the ugliness of certain mental health issues.

Are you happy in yourself when you're single? If not, then perhaps being in a relationship causes problems for you because it brings your core problems to the surface, since it's very hard to ignore them when you have a partner who sees every side of you. Addressing these core issues is really important.

I can definitely relate to a lot of what you said and, in my own personal experience, I'd say it was 50% due to being with somebody who wasn't right for me (which brought out a lot of frustration and stress) and 50% my own issues that I am currently trying to deal with.

So I would say you should focus on yourself and your own wellness, spend some time being single and really getting to know yourself and finding peace within yourself. Once you've achieved that (to as much an extent as you can realistically do) then you can open up your life to somebody else, but make sure you look at how previous relationships failed and try to identify any red flags that you should avoid in future partners, and avoid making the same mistakes yourself.

Regardless, getting more therapy and continuing to work through your emotions is probably a good idea. You might find that seeing a psychiatrist could help as they may be able to identify a mood disorder and prescribe some medication/alternative treatment that could help to level you out and avoid these cycles of extreme highs and lows.

I hope things improve for you, but try not to believe that you are somehow broken and unable to have a successful relationship - an overwhelming majority of relationships fail, so it's not just you. :)"

Great ideas here that I will share with him. Greatly appreciate it"
The best thing you can do right now is just breathe. Take some deep breaths and try to focus on something else for the time being.
Yea its a stressful time and big decision to make. I hope you get well man just push through it. Cant let our health hold us back

Yeah guess it is paranoia. Still don’t know why my anxiety gets mixed into it. But You’re right, I’ll definitely record them. Thankfully I’ve already made a headstart on my google docs.

Also yes I will stay away from alcohol and drugs! I know the risk factors for those mentally ill and will be sure to keep that in mind. 

Thank you very much for the help, I appreciate it!!!"
"&gt; Same goes for you. It's not your responsibility to fix him or understand him, it's your responsibility to listen and lend a hand when he asks for it. But if he won't do the same for you, you need to take care of yourself before you lose your house, your job, and your relationships like what happened to me.

I just want to emphasize this again by quoting it, you're on-point here."
"I am not a doctor, so please keep that in mind. What you describe sounds a great deal like undiagnosed, untreated ADHD. (I have learned a great deal about it because I have it. I was not diagnosed until well into adulthood. I wish with all my heart that I could have gotten help with it a lot sooner than I did.)

Please at least consider talking to your school’s guidance counselor. "
"I'm not sure about that. 

I am all for telling people who have *still-living* relatives that they need to be more empathetic, but I can't understand why you'd choose to make someone's suicide more difficult on those who are still alive. If the person is dead then there's nothing else you can say that will help them, so you may as well make the lives of those who still exist easier. "
"I've been on Lexapro, Hydroxyzine and Risperidal for a while. I have depression and GAD. They've all helped, especially in decreasing anxiety. I no longer experience major episodes as much. For a few days now, I've only been on Lexapro and I've been quite fine, though it might be a little too early to judge. What works for me might not work for you, but perhaps you should go for it. "
"Okay. What symptom is the biggest problem for you right now, if you had to pick one?

What's something you want that your symptoms are interfering with?

Was there anything in therapy that was helpful for you?

What caused the PTSD? (you can be as vague as you want, I just ask because there's a difference between 'car accident' and 'several years with an emotionally abusive partner')"
"Only way I found that helped was meditation, while laying down.. You basically learn to quiet your thoughts, the more you do it the easier it gets.. Soon as you learn how to quiet your thoughts, sleep will follow shortly after..

Might take alot of practice, but it will pay off in the long run.. Use to take me hours to fall asleep, now I can sleep anywhere within five minutes �� "
"The protocol in a nutshell

You will have to do every therapy your psychiatrist and psychologist tell you no excuses (this is due to the government or private health care agency)

If you do not youll be ""thrown out"" because you have nothing to give in return to society

Its either cope with society or go to the streets/asylum if you're a danger to other

My advice do what you're told"
"There's potential that you could win the lottery too. You cannot deny this, it's just math. How many lottery tickets did you buy today? None? I guess you don't really want to be happy then. You need to take responsibility for your life and spend all of your money on lottery tickets. You obviously don't love yourself because you didn't spend all of your money on lottery tickets today."
"This sounds like a delusion and may or may not be part of another, bigger, mental health problem. Many of these kind of disorders onset in early adulthood. Social withdrawal (becoming more introverted) is also a common early sign. 
I’m not sure what country she is in and what kind of resources there may be for mental health, but I think she really needs to get some help with this. "
"Yes, I want to confirm that I've used psychologytoday to find therapists for others as well - they have a pretty decent filter system, which means you can find someone who specializes in your concerns, takes your insurance, is close, etc.    


I would always recommend calling ahead to confirm that they have what you're looking for and that they have room to schedule you. Good luck! "
"diet and exercise! it’s not the easiest, but i’ve found i always feel better after getting a good workout done in the morning, plus i’m more awake for my am classes. plus, i take vitamins, eat fairly clean and drink TONS of water. doesn’t make the bad stuff go away, but it definitely doesn’t make it worse. feeling physically good makes my days a bit easier to get through :)"
"It’s definitely justified to feel anxious after such a scary situation.
I don’t think the guy is going to get a friend request and associate it with the robbery. I also am fairly certain that he would not look at the friends of the person who friended him and think “that’s the one that is checking on me”. He also will most certainly seek revenge on you. This person has shown they make poor/illegal decisions but they didn’t display any violence.  Is your belief that they are going to see that you looked at their profile and then come attack you? I think you have a far greater chance of getting injured in a random accident. "
"I've had a lot of therapists and they are not all created equal. Some were more professional, some lacked appropriate boundaries, some practiced a type of therapy that wasn't a good fit for me and didn't meet my needs. When I found a good one, the difference was progress. I used the videos below to gauge what a good therapist was and once I knew what to look for, it made things so much better!

"MyDoor, you are describing a great fear of abandonment and an inability to trust other people, including your own parents.  You also are describing an inability to regulate your own emotions so as to avoid the frequent mood swings -- and to be able to recover more quickly from the anger episodes.

Significantly, most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, CBT, and TFP) that can teach you those emotional regulation skills.  But, to take advantage of those programs, it is essential that you start trusting someone so you can obtain the professional guidance you need.

If you suffered some sort of trauma in early childhood, it likely is very difficult for you to trust loved ones or anyone else who draws close to you.  Yet, that is exactly what you must do if you are to obtain the professional guidance you need.  Do you have a counselor at school on whom you could rely?"

I tend to place myself last in the scheme of things. Everything, really, and only fully realize it when I fell neck deep in alligators. "
"Kind of silly question, but have you hung out with any of your colleagues? Since you said they think like you do, some of them might have a common interest with you. 

I've had similar experiences. The thing I tried to do was to try and find people with at least one shared interest and maybe try to learn about otgee stuff they liked. 

Just for curiosity, what are your main interests?"
"Thank you!!! 

I try not to blame myself... but I swear it feels  I’m always doing something wrong (according to them) and I guess the mentality that I’m always screwing up kinda got instilled in me. Sometimes I’ll be trying hard to figure out what I did and literally cannot think of one thing (because I didn’t do anything) and I’ll still make up a reason to blame myself. :("
"That sounds really hard and I think it's great that you are looking at your options.
I would tell the receptionist that you would like to discuss treatment options with the doctor. If you consider discussing medication, I would mention that as well. In my country medication must be described by a doctor, so a doctor's visit is necessary. But that might differ from country to country. "
Yes in fact it'll get way. Ewaaaaaaay worse as you alcoholism progresses......they're called delirium tremors....they can kil you by raising blood pressure to stroke levels.....if I were you I'd learn to take benzodiazapenes....hut oh fk be careful .....or you'll just be addicted to both......stop drinking when it isn't fun anymore .....Sooner or later it'll turn on you ..............
"Fuck off with that. Your daughter is going through a lot mentally and emotionally and you seem almost apathetic. 

&gt; I just no longer want anything to do with it.

How fucking selfish can you be as a father? She is 16 years old! Wtf is wrong with you? I can tell you this my father would never have acted like this. If my sister or me had acted like your daughter has he would’ve been with us 24/7 for as long as we needed it and he certainly wouldn’t have said “if it’s God’s will”. What a fucking cop out. Just admit what that statement is! “I don’t wanna deal with my mentally ill daughter anymore because it’s to hard."
"I hate to tell you, but eating and then purging it is bulimia. Thank goodness you stopped though before it got a real hold on you. I did the same thing for years, and when I wasn't purging (even small amounts of food), I was starving myself and cutting. Yep. I was there. I so feel you on this. I am sending tons of love your way. I am glad you didn't go through with the suicide attempt. I was there too. I attempted twice within 4 weeks of each other, and almost died both times. Can you go talk to someone? It may help to get this out and maybe they can recommend some techniques for you to try to ease the depression. Love and hugs to you!"
"They can be very confronting when you're faced with the parts of yourself that you've locked away.  Therapy helps bring it all up,  so you can work through it.  But it does make you feel sh*t in the meantime.  Sorry that you're having you deal with it ,  but it's beneficial on the long run.  

What i suggest is write down all that you're feeling now and take it with you to your next appointment.  They may have some really good strategies on how to cope. 

In the meantime find something that you enjoy doing and treat yourself kindly.  Or is you're struggling,  maybe see if you can get an earlier appointment to go back and see them again"
"Happiness, to me is just a cookie on the way. If it’s there, it’s there - no matter the reasons. Maybe you think tv shows are stupid so you destroyed your tv and are now very happy. Sounds stupid? Maybe, but happiness is happiness. Your feelings are real feelings. They all come and go though. What gives life meaning and purpose, the feeling of deeper peace than happiness could give, is health + usefulness. Being the best person you can be and living that person by doing something that matters to you. If happiness is there, you deserve it - otherwise it wouldn’t be there. Who knows, maybe the mind realized that all the misery wasn’t too useful? That we can learn from our mistakes, even when they are not punished with emotional gunfire?  Anyway, if you’re in a moment of this peace - you won’t question it. You just know, it’s overpowering any thoughts you could think about it"
"I don't know what are the symptoms that make you feel abused, but if they exist, then I would encourage you to credit your own reality (as I feel you're doing) and explore that for its own sake. I've thought about intent a lot. I find that it's okay to realize that perhaps no harm was intended, but simultaneously acknowledging that the harm was done. The confusion or even distress comes from wanting to be either or the other - as if there is some ""True"" core to be found that will give you a straight answer on whether you were abused or not. I can absolutely empathize in wanting to get to that truth, but personally, over time, I've found healing in learning to realize that both might be true to a degree and there is some peace in staying with that ambiguity. 

Still, I agree with Qeltar\_ - you should bring this up with your therapist as something important to you and pursue it further. "
"It does matter what mental illness people have. And people with NPD don’t need or deserve more energy from someone than anyone else. That role needs to be filled by a therapist, Not a loved one. The way personality disordered people interact with other people is fundamentally different. Sure they can also be in pain, but characteristically personality disorders cause more pain to others than the self. Personality disorders also perpetuate a cycle of trauma. They should not be held in similar regards to internalizing disorders because it is just not the same. And it is not right to insinuate that someone else should have to pick up the pieces of a personality disordered person. And “love” where NPD is involved involves cycles of love bombing and abuse. It is not the same.

Hope something here helps!"
"it's easy for humans to get caught up in the thoughts in our head. Chances are, the past two weeks triggered you, and you freaked yourself out by overthinking all your current thoughts/feelings. 

I imagine it started off with ""god, i'm so sick of all this crap"" -&gt; ""i just want it to end"" -&gt; ""do i want my life to end?"" -&gt; ""am i suicidal?"" -&gt; ""why am i thinking about suicide? i better lock up the gun"" -&gt; ""whats wrong with me, have i become suicidal now? when did this happen?"" -&gt; ""is the depression getting worse?""

I have a totally biased opinion and i'm not a therapist, but i think most people have had encountered some type of suicidal ideation at some point. It's normal to think about the ""what ifs"" of life. So long as they are fleeting curiosity-based thoughts, i wouldn't be too worried. I would be worried when the idea of suicide becomes rational and feasible to you."
"Do you know why you feel like a freak?

Because society has a strong bias against introverts. Extroverts are seen as ""normal"" while introverts are treated as misfits, loners, or people with social problems.  Thus words like ""lonely"" that have negative connotations.

Introversion is not a mental illness, it's simply a disposition, like being left-handed or right-handed. But hey, even lefties have had to deal with bias! Acceptance of introversion is getting better, but only very slowly.

&gt; But after about an hour or two or socializing, I just get so...tired. I NEED to just be by myself and recharge.

You may not have realized it, but this is actually one of the classical ways of identifying an introvert. Extroverts expend energy when they are alone and find it draining, and they get ""recharged"" by being in social circumstances. Introverts are the opposite. And of course, some people are a mix of both.

I am mostly an introvert. I don't mind social settings to a limited degree, but I need to recharge by myself or with just my immediate family after. Exactly the same.

If you're happy, you are doing fine. What others think doesn't matter."
"Most people are like this. I was like this for decades. I still am to some extent, though I am getting better.

The ""this"" I mean being hurt by what other people say, or think, or do (mentally, I don't mean a physical attack). It's a natural thing to feel. It doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. 

But it's disempowering. It gives other people control over you. Exactly what you said: ""the power of their words."" 

If I can say something mean to you and ruin your day, then I control your life. If I can say something mean to you and you can say ""wow, there must be something really bothering him"" and go about your business, then YOU control your life.

This is not excusing their behavior. This is about neutering it so even though their behavior is wrong, it doesn't hurt you as much.

Is this easy? No. It takes time and practice and there will be good days and bad days. But it's the only path to freedom. Because there are always going to be people who say mean things, or even hurtful things unintentionally. You can't change them (though society is changing slowly). You can only change yourself.

I know it's hard. But as chuckhart said, you need to own it, though the word I would use is ""accept."" That doesn't mean it's great or you like it. It just means you say ""this is part of what I am."" If someone wants to make fun of depression, then that just means they have a problem. Not you. Or me."
"Your writing is damn perfect to describe the experience, goddamn. I haven't had nearly as rough of a bunch of experiences as you have, thankfully. It's downright incredible to read accounts from someone else who's experiences something like I have, thought with what seems like a lot more intensity.

I had attacks from (as far as I remember) 9ish-12, and have some mild residuals now, but haven't had the full-blown version since 12. It didn't shake me quite so badly after a few years, and they never went back-to-back, thankfully. It's been burned into my memory since, here we go:

The hard/edge feeling is accurate for me, it's sorta like everything between the edges of contact between myself and the bed/blanket felt flat and just a uniform pressure rather than a texture, and the edges themselves are highlighted/oversensitive. If I'm still looking around at all, edges stand out from objects, highlighted and artifacting slightly, things don't look 2D but they look oddly thin in depth without losing perspective. The height of the ceiling or the distance to the far wall become...variable, normal at once glance and 50' away on another. Ceiling lights would glitch this once in a while, my brain knew what size it was supposed to look like, and tried to adapt a '50 feet = 5 feet' logic, this just made me dizzy so I avoided it.

Time as my body perceived it slows, physical feedback from the bed/air fades off, but mentally it's a whirlwind. I remember the ambient noise getting sucked away, replaced by a soft static-ish hiss. There was a fast feeling of deep, primal dread (where I could usually tell I wasn't just falling asleep funny) and of being forcefully sucked/backflipping through the bed itself by some incredible force. I still don't like rollercoasters that do certain motions because of that.

Maybe 1/5 times, at this point, I could mentally trash and struggle enough to get out of it (if I could get one toe to twitch and give a new touch response, I was free), and fall asleep afterwards fine, but usually not.

The feeling of force/flipping turned into acceleration, like being shoved along an infinite, wide track and gradually approaching lightspeed. Felt real enough that my chest/abs refused to breathe normally, shorter gaspy breaths. The audio parts started kicking in a bit after I got 'launched' from the bed. Random, short yelps or yells, sometimes clips from my memory, sometimes a word or two, and always stuff in either a harsh or a pleading tone. They'd get louder as the speed picked up, more urgent and aggressive, turned into some hellish symphony of head-filling screaming fights without discernible words, all feeling like they were aimed square at me. Still feeling like falling backwards at 0.8c through this bit, both volume and speed rising.

This usually lasted from 3-5 min or so to this point, and varied a bit afterwards. Most often, thanks to being in an apartment, a bang/thud from a door closing would register through this at some point, sounding like it was very far away but louder and boomier than the clusterfuck. Sometimes, my parents would notice and wake me. Either of these resulted in a 2000mph-to-0 snap back into my own head (the feeling of being back inside your own, solid skull is a weird one), body feeling fading back in, and the yelling fading quickly back into a hiss then gone. I remember several times where it just melded the feeling of the bed and ambient noise back in over top of the cacophony, which makes a quiet room seem like it's ear-splittingly loud.

In either case, that spacial deformity stuck around for a few minutes after snapping back, the floor seemed a long fall away, the door a hundred feet away but 50 feet tall. My hand in front of my face would be normal, but at arm's length kept reporting that it was possibly gigantic. The primal dread fades off, but the anxiety didn't.

Once, I remember riding through the effect, mentally bracing against whatever the hell this experience was (I was 12 and tired of it kicking my ass). The falling/acceleration feeling kept climbing after 5 min (I'm fairly sure no person has felt this level of speed in reality before), the yelling ascending to a stream of hundreds of angry, hostile sounds overlapping to where only the peaks stuck out. The screaming stopped (but not at all once), the speed didn't change, but its scale no longer mattered, because the space I felt I was floating in was infinite. I suppose outer space is the only comparable thing, just infinite black nothingness in every direction with zero perceived 'end' anywhere. I got pretty panicked about whether or not I had somehow left my body doing this, since this was a bit different. The return to the bed was a hard jolt that time,  I twitched in a way that felt like I fell into the mattress from a short distance up, but without leaving it. It wasn't the last attack, but the only one I ever had go that far.

As for the residual stuff... thankfully really mild. The spacial effect happens randomly in certain conditions (looking darker to better lit space, not much motion, and I'm tired but staying up). Edges seem a bit 'harder' along with the effect, but there's no warning to it otherwise. If I'm looking into the hallway from my desk, it'll seem 10' away then 100'  then 10' again as I look at it, keeping perspective/relative distances of things at distance unaffected. Someone standing in the doorway would be 5', then 50' tall according to what my brain is trying to tell me. This lasts for between 30 seconds or so to a few minutes, and can happen repeatedly in one night. I've gotten a bit used to it in that I can carry on a conversation while it happens, losing focus for a second as I force my brain to accept normal scale a few times."
"1. Your phone is a computer, so you're still in front of a computer screen.

2. Like I said, you're going around hurting people.

Choose another therapist. as ignorant as I hate to say it but whoever is is can subconsciously change the way you interact with them
"Good luck! Check with your doctor if you’re unsure,  but mine certainly took a few weeks to adjust but are working well now ��"
"I actually have drawn it! It’s a wolf head with spiky hair, a gaping mouth with razor-sharp teeth, and pupil-less, bloodshot eyes."
"I have no idea how severe mine is, I really hope it's not that bad. Knowing it's possible to get better would make everything easier"
I keep checking lifeisokevenwhen.com to see if anyone has posted here. If they have then I try to find positives in their situation.
I've been assured by my psychiatrist that this is normal. It's usually one of the last things to come back during remission as well.
"It goes away some days and the days happen more and more often.  

So that must mean, some day it is gone entirely, there is hope :)"
Like a gray cover over the normal world. Over food and family and other things I always used to love. Like black and white and hazy.
"Thanks for your reply and for trying to solve it. I appreciate it really, and hope that somebody with a precedent will spot this. :)"
"Thanks guys for all the good comments, I'm gonna have a chat with my dad and discuss all the options and see which ones we wanna try"
Thanks! Ive got an app for guided meditation but never really stuck to it for more than 2 goes at a time. Ill give it a proper shot!
"That’s great advice. Thank you for replying! I’m currently seeing a counsellor (finally), so hopefully this helps in some way.  "
"This is kind of the debate, actually. If you watch the Kirsch video, you will see how the comment you just made fits the discourse. "
"We all have moments that we're aren't proud of. I guess we focus on the good, and hopefully the bad doesnt find its way back to us. "
We will definitely state repost in future posts. We apologize for any inconvenience. We are collecting responses until mid-October.
"We've talked about it before, he knows. We both get incredibly apathetic though, so I'm just hoping he's just sleeping or something."
"Well it did used to be the doctor's surgery in Victorian times. Probably a few people died horribly in my room, come to think of it!"
"get to know the new you i guess. from the way i see it, it doesnt seem like a particularly bad thing that happened. just embrace it."
you nailed it on the head with the bolt in a chair comment. I find myself obsessing over minutia and minor details of these worlds.
"Accept that most of your thoughts aren't controllable. Just find ways to let them pass, or even chant a mantra or something. I was listening to a guided meditation and the person speaking kept repeating ""you are safe... you are safe... you are safe"" ... and told the listeners to tell themselves that too. So sometimes I will say "" I am safe"" over and over in my mind to reassure myself. "
"I believe we still have problems with being judged simply from suffering from poor mental health. I am open about my illness and it has definitely alienated me from certain people. They would never acknowledge it but I'm obviously seen as ""that guy"" and somebody who is easier just to forget about. I don't know how to change this so I just continue to be myself and live life regardless."
"I think you are in the right subreddit, but need to be more clear about what you're struggling with, in your own thread.

This is offtopic, offensive, and completely disconnected from the substance of my post and this thread.  

Non-sequiters are not rebuttals.  Denial is not a shared worldview.  Assertions that 'depressed people' are why Trump was elected are not statistically viable."
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

"I'm so sorry to hear this, it sounds awfully traumatic. For the short term I'd highly recommend getting some benzodiazpines such as valium or xanax. It will calm you right down and reduce any fear you may be experiencing. How you get them can be both legal/illegal but it worked for me. After that has passed I'd think about going to the doctor for CBT, may I ask what country your from? "
"Not likely. He’s living in a small trailer with his gf and they’re pretty broke themselves. So it would be me sleeping on a floor and worrying about food or money, which probably wouldn’t be very good for me. 

I finally manned up and told my mom about how I feel and all my crap. It went well. She said she’d call a doctor tomorrow and we’re gonna go and see how it works out. "
"Oh so hard to resist. I found a therapist's blog once and was like, ""Ohmigod she's an idiot."" She was writing as though she had amazing discoveries about things I already knew.

She was 22-24 and I was 35. The experience gap was huge. I had more experience with psychology than she did. She was super insecure about it, too.

She ended up quitting on the same day I was going to fire her!"
"Thank you my friend. This is just really really hard on me. I have really bad anxiety and she was the first and only person that I trusted enough to tell them everything. We got along so well and all that. But it’s unbearable.. I go to sleep thinking about her. I wake up thinking about her. I couldn’t imagine a life without her and now that it’s here, I feel lost and so depressed"
"Thanks....I feel so freaking helpless, fighting against this stupid thing in my head. As I said, this isn't the end of the world ffs--it can be managed (probably not ""cured"" but managed) and I still can do everything I used to be able to do...

I just...I dunno. Thanks though. I didn't self-harm at all (last night) and  I am not feeling any better, but things can only get better right?"
"That and maybe ADHD. It can also ruin social interaction.

I honestly don't  think you're retarded at all, I think it's all the opposite! And obviously, if you've got strait a's, it's because you're better than average, and that's probably why you have trouble getting along with people of your age.

Don't be discourage. You don't have long to get to the adult point �� 

Good luck! "
"Usually I will use an action instead, such as tapping my finger or toe, something subtle and quite and generally unnoticeable, and focus on that while trying to blank my mind. If that's not enough, I'll repeat a word in my head (usually ""no"") to interrupt my thoughts. Oddly, it only seems to work for those very severe instances and not the everyday runaway train of thoughts in my head."
"You are certainly entitled to your beliefs, but I don't agree, no.

I believe every person has worth. I don't see the idea of people having no worth being congruent with nature at all. 

Also, I have met many people with depression who felt they had no worth, and once they get treatment, they no longer feel that way.

I never meet people without depression who think they have no worth."
"You’re definitely not dead. But dpdr makes you feel like you’re not living. It’s a terrible feeling. I described it to friends as though I was living in a huge empty house with no chairs or furniture in it, so there’s no where to sit down. It’s thought to do with down-regulated opioid receptors. I started experiencing this after an extended period of untreated physical pain. "
"I'd go ahead and post on those animation subreddits. If they aren't willing to help out another animator, then it's a toxic environment that you shouldn't be a part of anyway. I wish I could help out more on the animation side of things, but all i can suggest is just taking the smallest step(s) back into it and don't let the idea of you're not having done it in a while daunt you.

As far as doing fulltime goes, perhaps don't tell them fulltime at first? Considering how greedy companies are for employees that don't do enough time for benefits, I doubt you'd have any issues asking for just 25-30 hours a week to start of.  

Best of luck. "
"It's not about playing nice, it's about effective problem-solving. While I know all too well that in can feel very satisfying to get revenge... Doing that to your partner is not going to make things better for either of you.

I wish more adults were able to see that and temporarily put their feelings to one side and work together. You're partners, not enemies. There have been countless times where I've wanted to scream at partners, shout and swear, reverse their behaviour on them... But what does that solve? It just escalates the situation and damages your relationship even more.

If you want to fix these things, you have to stay calm. "
"Try not to drive yourself mad with guilt, life happens, people get sick, this isn’t your fault. I don’t mean that to sound blunt, but honestly don’t beat yourself up. Many of us haven’t seen our parents or family members for a while, so don’t feel ashamed of that. Whatever the outcome you still have time with him. I can’t imagine how hard this is but try and stay present and take things a day at a time. Be there for your dad as much as you can. If it turns out bad, he won’t want the remainder of time spent with you to be sad, with you kicking yourself over this. It’s clear you care about your Dad, I’m sure he knows xxx"
"Yeah, could be. Or could be that you just don't have the right set of symptoms to qualify for a DSM diagnosis. Not saying you have this, but maybe look into Borderline Personality Disorder. In my experience BPD is the result of being born with having intense emotional reactions (i.e., getting overwhelmed by small things, feeling things intensely, etc) coupled with trauma or invalidation in childhood. This results in a certain set of symptoms. You may not have developed BPD, but still have that innate emotional reactivity that's common in people with BPD. Maybe not, I don't really know enough about you, but it's worth a shot to look at. "
"yes, just because he has a mental health issue doesn’t mean he’s a monster. 

but it is NOT your job to stick around and fix him. are you happy in this relationship? do you like who you are when you’re around him? do you look forward to seeing him? do you feel safe in his company? if you answered no to any of these, you shouldn’t be in this relationship. 

his behavior is abusive. he has some sort of issue. sounds narcissistic to me, but i’m not a psychiatrist. encourage him to get help, and leave. he will ruin your life if you both continue down this path. it doesn’t matter what issue he has, it’s not your job to fix it. "
"As someone else said in the comments, I also highly recommend DBT for coping and skill building. A core part of DBT if focusing on the balance between acceptance and change, which is something I feel like you might be struggling with at the moment. If you don't have the resources to get into a DBT program, there are some workbooks that you can buy on amazon. The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook is a great introduction into DBT, its simple and easy to follow. If you want something more in-depth, DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets is great, and was written by the creator of DBT, Marsha Linehan. If you go to my page, I have been posting overviews of various DBT skills/topics. If there's anything specific you'd like me to go over, let me know and I'll make a post about it. Message me if you'd like to discuss further or have any further questions, I'd be happy to help. "
"i'll share some coping methods I use- 

researching something but like every aspect of it, ex: today I researched ocean, that took me to benthic zone, which took me to anglerfish, to the lophius budegassa. from there I'll watch videos, search google scholar for articles, and switch to a new topic when I'm bored

buying a textbook on a subject you want to teach yourself. last summer I bought a thermal physics textbook (used, inexpensive) and taught it to myself. I watched videos, solved problems, it was a nice distraction

simple things like walking a dog

baking

drawing, painting

I tried better help for about 6 months last year. As an anecdotal response, I found it largely unhelpful. Ive had phone calls with the suicide hotline that were more helpful that weeks of conversation. The woman I spoke with would frequently message me phrases such as 'feel better' and 'don't think about it.'

One time I messaged her asking if she thought id ever feel like myself again. I was referring to feeling dissociated. she responded ""who knows"" 

at the end of the day though, maybe the app is better than nothing.

best of luck

"I can’t diagnose you or give you any 100% answers but as a mentally ill person yes that is normal. It, however, is not normal for a regular hormonal teenager. 

This is something I struggled with as well (or at least something similar.) I would be suicidal, going through the motions, empty, and sad; but then I would have a day where it wasn’t so bad and I was enjoying my life and those moments planted seeds of doubt. “Maybe I’m doing this for attention” “maybe I’m not as bad as I think I am” “this is normal I just can’t handle it like everyone else” that’s one of the reasons it took so long to get help. Those little thoughts in the back of your head aren’t true and it’s so hard to really believe that. Feeling actively suicidal (which is how you’re feeling) is never “normal”. 

Going to the doctor and getting a diagnosis is so scary because for some reason it seems like once you’re labeled then that’s all that you are. For awhile I teetered on the edge of not wanting a diagnosis and just really needing validation that what I was feeling was real. I am now diagnosed and getting help. Those diagnoses did not change me as a person I am still the exact same person Pre having those words put in my medical file, just happier, because now I have a treatment plan that fits and makes sense. I don’t know if you relate to this but before getting help I was so scared/anxious that if I went to a therapist or doctor and talked about my feelings they would just laugh in my face and tell me it was normal to feel that way. I can tell you that is NOT what happened and now reflecting back I can see how truly sick I was. "
"The best advice I think I can give might also be one of the hardest things to do.  


You have to make her get help. This is definitely easier said then done, I realize that. And usually with people that have these kinds of paranoia issues it's nigh impossible to convince them that they need help and that the people they are talking to are actually helping them.   
Personally I can recommend trying to get some professional opinions first. Your general practitioner might a good place to start. While they might not be a mental health care professional they do forward a lot of people with mental health issues to said professionals.  


If you can't convince her at all, there are two options that I can think off left.  
One is somehow proving to a court that she is a danger to herself or her surroundings when untreated. I'm not sure where you live and how the law works over there, but here if that can be proven someone can be forcibly detained in a mental health care facility. This might sound harsh, and it won't be easy to do. And she will blame you at first.  
But please trust me that if she does get help while there, she will thank you afterwards, because it would mean that she can live her life again.  


Then there is the case that she really doesn't want to be helped. At that point you have to do one of the hardest things imaginable to a young person. You have to disown your own mother. Now this is not something I mention lightly. I realize how heartbreaking this can be and how much of a scar it can leave on yourself, because I have done it.  


Although now  I do realize what I did was for the best. Some people cannot be helped, no matter how much people around them try to help them. At that point the best you can do is move on and accept them back if they are willing to get help. Not only does it sometimes make people actually get help, the other times it's sadly a lost cause and at that point you should focus on your own life and development first.

No matter your choice, may it be something I listed or not, I wish you the best of luck in the future. Your situation is not an easy one and that should be said once in a while."
"#1 Supplement I would recommend is you’re feeling down is....

Exercise.

Secondarily a diet high in protein, carbs and low in fat."
"... and this is why I'd rather just kill myself than engage in a ""higher level of care"" when it's suggested by outpatient therapists."
Any tips on how to start doing that? Everytime I let myself get angry the next second I get flooded by guilt or get in trouble for it
"But the stereotypic movement disorder  can exist without autism. That is why it is rare and there is not much information.

Call your doctor the first moment you can. WebMD might have some advice on that. SSRIs can be difficult to navigate dosages through.
Do you have an Urgent Care center in your area? I'm not sure if they treat mental health issues. But it doesn't hurt to call and ask.
Get your B12 levels checked I have a b12 deficiency and the fog your describing sounds like that I have to take shots or sublinguals
Good luck! It can be helpful to write down beforehand what you want to say or tell them. It's easy to forget something in the moment.
"Google PMDD, I suffer from the same issues and I think it's a hormone imbalance or a thyroid thing. If you figure it out let us know!"
I have been there and it sucks so much to have someone who thinks they’re being supportive actually be totally dismissive and rude.
I just want to know that theres a reason I'm the way I am. I don't want to be a one-of-a-kind weirdo with an unnamed mental disorder.
"I know, I completely understand that, is just that is hard to move forward that feeling of being ignored. It makes me feel so lonely."
I think certain events and people can trigger depressive episodes but that doesn't make your depression any less legitimate or real.
"If you’re in college, you can see the school psychologist a couple of times for free and you don’t even have to tell your parents"
"Mom told me that unless you’re basically incapable of doing anything, you don’t need help for depression. Thanks, mom. Hypocrite."
My therapist told me that if you think you have something you probably should check it out. Idk if this is helpful but I hope it is.
"Nah, it’s because I’m diagnosed with a personality disorder. Once they read that, they always treat me with apathetic disregard. "
"Nope, personally. I don’t want my mental health problems to become work place gossip. I don’t want HR on my back. Nope nope nope "
Showering is a big thing with my depression. I just got through a bout of not showering for 2 weeks. I don't know what that's about.
"So you think that someone who's depressed and/or anxious should still feel something? And if you don't you're not in love, right?... "
Thank you! I will try that . I was reluctant try that because I thought she needed quietness and not more noise. Glad it helped you.
"That sounds like a lot to carry. I know you said therapy hasn't helped - perhaps a psychiatrist would be helpful.

Good luck to you. "
"Thing is I've already sent them a message like that like a week and a half ago, wouldn't I be overbearing or something at that point?"
"Well having a therapist helps. But if you don't feel comfortable talking to somebody face to face about this, just send me a message."
You need to force him to see a doctor. And you need to force him into therapy. Sometimes tough love is the only way to help somebody.
You need to go see a doctor. And you need to do it right now. Don't do something stupid that you'll regret for the rest of your life.
well I hope you get better and stuff.. I used to play PS4 Cod BO3.. But I can always go back on it if you ever wanna game or someshit
"yea i mean this is like in gay community those age isn’t a huge deal, this is nz so it’s legal. but yea i know not a smart idea. "
"As i did 6 years of college take it from me dont stress your self to much why because it leaves you to anxiety.

Stress caused me a mini-heart attack at 20, high blood pressure, i also developed bipolar ll because of it. I suggest you take it to your level and stay in it. Have fun in activities go out once a week. If by the year you see you can step up on other classes do it one by one."
I have had suicidal thoughts for at least 20 years and I am still here so I wouldn’t be too concerned. Although if you do start to develop an actual plan or something then definitely get help right away. Apparently even healthy people have suicidal thoughts at least once in their life. If you are really concerned then maybe make some kind of safety plan for when they come back again.
I hear you but saying “you should be more aware of mental illness and how to help people who suffer with it” is like saying “you should be more aware of science and how to knowledgeably discuss any given field”. There are so many mental illnesses and so many schools of thought on the best way for a non-professional to help a sufferer that it’s impossible to really get it all.
"I'm not an expert, but if you are genuinely concerned of being misdiagnosed, go for a second opinion with a different doctor. If your diagnosis is confirmed again and you have the option, ask them how it applies to you despite so many different characteristics you mentioned in your post. Your health is important and it's good to understand your condition before you attempt to treat it. "
If the professionals won’t acknowledge the suffering you endure it means they are apathetic and not good at their job. The don’t want to acknowledge your suffering. They might think that by minimising your feelings you’ll do better in life. All that will do is make you trust them less and stop opening up to them. Some people aren’t good at their job and aren’t worth your time
"Unless the person who said it is a psychologist and knows you for a long time, I wouldn't take it serious. 


Bipolar isn't the only condition that would cause what you mentioned. 

Seems like it's common nowadays to throw these terms around without even knowing much about them.

(I have been called Psychopath, Schizophrenic and Antisocial so many times and I don't fit the criteria.)

"Well hello and thank you. Yes, I had gotten help for those two things. I haven't self-harmed since 2016...and I am acutally 30 lbs. overweight right now lol. The Depression is managed by meds. The Anxiety is too. I am female and suffering not only from Asperger's...but I am also a firebug...that's a rare thing, but yah. It's hard to control but I manage it okay. Thanks for the reply. :)"
"Yeah shes gone way downhill, really fast. My family is hopeful she'll be able to go home after a while. But as I've tried to explain, once shes there, shes there. Stuff like dementia doesn't usually get better. It gets worse. There is a new drug that just hit FDA human trials called BAN2401 which looks very promising (we talked about it in my last CEU class) but those trials take years."
"I think that there is a therapist out there that you can get along with. It took me 8 ish years and 11 therapists to finally get it going. Granted, I was 12 and was forced into therapy at first, so it skewed my image of what therapy should be, but I finally found a therapist this past year and we work great together.

I had one therapist flat out tell me that therapy isn’t right for everyone, but I think that was out of frustration because I wouldn’t work with her. But she could be right. 

If you do decide that you want to discontinue therapy, remember if you ever think you need it again, you are more than welcome to go back to it. "
"It's really tough. My own family doesn't believe there's anything wrong with me. They also don't believe in mental health at all though, they think it's made up. I keep it all in. My therapists sometimes ask me if I still want to come in weekly or they ask when I might consider stopping therapy which blows my mind because I've had panic attacks. I have a lot of issues, but they're not my favorite things to discuss obviously, so I usually end up talking about more typical stuff like stresses I'm encountering in my life at the current week or what have you. For every one thing I say there's about 50 on backlog I should be saying. It sucks."
"She wanted to speak to a counsellor to get her head straight, so that has been the guideline. We spoke a couple of weeks in and then another a week ago when she let me know counselling was going ahead, now we're waiting until she two sessions in until we talk again.

I think that sounds like a good plan, I think if your feelings change at all across those two weeks it's a sign. Like I thought distance would just make her hate me, but she still misses me and says she loves me, so that's a good sign?

I think distance will show you either that you can live beyond the relationship, or that you realise you don't want to. It'll help I'm sure."
"I am living with a demon in my head right now, and some days I find it impossible or near impossible to push on and get through the day even. It is especially hard because I have to hide it from literally everyone. If you ever saw me with my family, you would think I am just a normal mama and wife. We laugh, joke, eat together, have bad days, good days, etc. Underneath all that normality is a festering wound and a demon that has to be chained up in my mind, lest it get out and cause real damage to a building or a person. I just look at my kids and think that I don't want to lose them, so I push through all the anxiety, depression, and this other problem and keep my head up. I hope you can do the same. Some days it is harder, some easier. As Dory says, just keep swimmin'. Sorry...watched a LOT of Disney over the weekend. Try to have a good day, and if you need me I am here to chat with. :)"

"Not him, but-

I highly recommend you get screened for things you/others suspect before your parent's insurance runs out at 26. Diagnosis is painless, money is not. It's way easier to diagnose in younger people. I'm learning that the hard way with ADHD. Very very similar symptoms, much more common than Autism/Aspergers. Next most likely is anxiety disorders, followed by just being maladaptive (aka raised wrong).

You don't want to be 27, with no money or insurance, and finally accepting that something might be wrong even if it's not what you/others thought it was.

EDIT: Adding to that, no matter what it is that's wrong, if anything at all, 30 years old is generally the soft cut-off to ""know thyself"" in terms of having identified personal problems and trained yourself to compensate. It gets significantly harder the older you are, and the consequences of not doing so get bigger. Tick tock."
"Yeah, I hear you. It can be expensive. Are you in the US? You can ask any therapist to work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based. There are also clinics where you might qualify for a certain number of free sessions. Most colleges also offer counseling free to students, worth checking out. Any of these should also be able to refer you to resources that might help. 

There's also the crisis textline, text HELLO to 741741 and they will be able to connect you to resources. 

And of course, there is always therapist Kati Morton on youtube. Not the same as seeing your own but she's helped me through a lot and you can ask questions under her vids (she answers as many as she can in the first hour after her vids are posted on Mondays and Thursdays). 

It's worth trying every avenue you can to get the support you need. Ask around. You don't have to go through this alone. "
"&gt;“you really think I don’t consider how you feel?”

""Yes, or you wouldn't keep doing this when I tell you I don't like it..."""
"Can you be more specific about the third one? I know that can be hard, I'm just trying to learn specific things I should look out for "
Catholic (you don't have to be Catholic) Social Services. There is one in my area and they choose what to charge based on your income.
Good luck OP. I think its great that your sticking with your plan to pursue your goal. I hope a steady path clears a way for you soon.
Hope it goes well for you! I found someone I really liked on my first try but I hope you don't give up if you have to try one or two.
I like to look at showers as being sprayed with holy water. It cleans off the dirt and negative energy and boosts your self-esteem ; )
If you have them then so do I!  I do the same exact things you do. My head goes a mile a minute if I am in any kind of confrontation.
"If your friends drifted away after just four weeks of you taking time for yourself, they are fair weather friends that you don't need."

"Ive woken up feeling anxietal around 3 am, a shower is a good way to break myself of a negative thought cycle. Good tip. Stay strong! "
Medication helps some. It also helps to have somebody to talk to. That way you can get these thoughts and feelings out of your system.
NO NO! He's manipulating you! He's making you feel guilty on PURPOSE!!! Please look up 'grey rocking' and go to r/raisedbynarcissists

"Thank you, and whilst I know this is a long journey that won’t be easy, I just finally know that people will be there alongside me. "
Which type of mindfulness did your therapist describe - paying attention to your thoughts it paying attention to a sensory experience?
"Yeah I'd imagine that it would be frightening. Just go to your therapist and be honest with them. If you do that, then you'll be fine."
i've always been an introvert but i never had anxiety unless I was asking a girl to the dance. Now I get anxiety just going into work.
well at least you have a sense of humor about it. maybe take a trip to the park where you can have open flame and get off on that. lol
"I don't know your story. I don't know your pain. And I am sorry for whatever it is you are going through. I am of the belief that everyone has hope of a future, no matter what we've been through. Our past does not define our future. It takes time. It takes work. And it is painful. But even without knowing you, without knowing your story, I believe fully, that you have a hope of a future."
"I don't take any medication aside from melatonin for sleeping. It's difficult to explain but my biggest issues are what I mentioned above coupled with feeling as though I'm a completely different person when I'm in social situations like college, to the point that I really stress about what I might have said or done.

I've been trying to eat healthier as of recent, thanks for the advice."
"I feel like if our are uncomfortable you should maybe find another therapist? Fair enough we all have to start somewhere but I think if you find someone you have more of a connection with you will be more comfortable and therefore more honest about how you are really feeling day to day. Therapists don’t take it personally and want the best for their patients.

Hope it all goes alright "
"I haven’t done well with them, and have become even more symptomatic while on some. 

SSRIs aren’t the wonder drug they’re purported to be. Basically, they only accidentally work on depression for some people. The old science is proving to be wrong, including some of the assumptions regarding the connections between depression and serotonin. Hence why SSRIs have such low efficacy. "
"I think ""responsibility"" is a more appropriate word choice here. Some people are weaker than others and find it harder to fix things themselves. It's not their fault that life made them that way. They can try to change it and that is their responsibility, but I wouldn't say it's their fault.

Regardless, I'd say that ""responsibility"" is way more constructive than ""fault"" in this context."
"I've been diagnosed with it by a doctor. The only difference is that I don't have hallucinations. I don't see anything that shouldn't be there and I don't hear anything that shouldn't be there. Mine is mostly the paranoia, anger, bipolar, delusions, and so on. I've been on this sinking ship since 2014. And that's why I've been trying to help other people who are struggling right now too."
"Is that what's it's called, psychological well-being? I've not heard of that before unless it's just a different name for primary mental health who I wouldn't go back to if you paid me. I'm quite convinced some sort of self help technique is what I need but I've not found it yet and in the mean time on bad days I feel helpless. I've actually not gone out today as a preventative measure. "
"It sounds like dissociation which is pretty common in a number of mental disorders. I have borderline personality disorder and definitely feel that exact way from time to time. 

I suggest reading this information about it to see if it resonates with you.

Hang in there my friend. You aren’t alone. "
"That's the problem. I'm in a college town. My family's halfway across the country, my friends live on campus or in small apartments. With my car and cats, school supplies and all of my personal stuff, it's too much for a friend's space, and all the leases I've seen right now are too expensive or too far away from my school.

Unless I take the semester off and move home, I'm pretty stuck."
"I don't know about getting better but there are good periods and bad periods. Right now I think I'm worse than I've ever been (not this instant but this past year). But I know it'll eventually pass and there'll be more good times ahead.

This time round, when things get better, I'm determined to be careful and not get complacent. There are things I can do to avoid triggering another collapse. I know I can't prevent it 100% but I can at least delay it/make it less likely to happen.

Hope things get better. Try meds, try more therapy, try CBT, improve your environment, health, and diet. Just keep fighting and something will work eventually."
"I'm not sure what to say. I just want you to know that I read this, and I am glad that not only do you (1) recognise your need for help and have (2) planned to seek it out, but  you're so eager to meet this period of serious examination that you're (3) seeking the input and perspective of others in the meantime. Wow! Congrats, and keep up the great work! 

I don't really have anything to add except....maybe consider [this trying about self-care while you're on your journey](http://memeculturemom.tumblr.com/post/178092984989/selfcareafterrape-i-think-it-is-important-to)  ��������✊��������������"
It happens to me too when my depression is bad and I’m getting way too overwhelmed. I completely withdraw and shut down. I cannot function and every hour and day that goes by makes me feel worse about myself and increases my anxiety &amp; depression. It’s very scary how debilitating your mind can be on your fully functional body.  What I did last time to snap me out of it was actually taking some advice I read on here about just forcing yourself to do ONE thing. I chose to move my hanging plant that I have in my room onto my dresser so it could get some sunshine. Sounds silly but that’s all it took to start building that momentum.
"No, it’s hard to have a honest talk with my parents enough as it is but doing that would just be... impossible. They say that they love me and care for me deeply, and I wish I could believe that but I don’t. The thoughts have recently come back and I have gotten a hold of more than enough pain killers to kill me. I’ve been starting to like being at school more because it’s better than being at home, my admittedly blunt nature and beginning to question their authority making me have to walk on eggshells around everyone. I’m starting to feel more trapped then ever and really need to know how to somehow make this better for myself."
"Something that may be helpful for you is a Partial Care or IOP program. Not sure if that is something that you have considered, but it is nice middle ground from an inpatient hospital stay and a one time a week therapy appointment. Some focus on mental health only, and some have dual tracks with both mental health and substance abuse. I personally have been in an IOP program for mental health before, and found it to be one of the most helpful things I have ever done.

i would be more than happy to talk to you about it if you have any questions! And just remember, it's a journey to feel better. It takes time, and that is ok! 

&amp;#x200B;"
"Sorry I suck at writing, I went to a counselling once and the therapist said I'm depressed bcs of my mother. But she keeps pushing me to do hypnotherapy for more than an hour. Meh. 

So I talked to a friend yesterday, and I tell them that my parents will live separately (not actually get a divorce or anything) and then my friend ask 'oh why', I answered 'oh they dont get along well' before I said it, I feel negative, my throat tightened a bit, it became difficult to talk, I felt like I want to cry, maybe because of the negative feeling? 

It keeps happening to me, the want to cry thing, but I dont actually cry 
Thank you for your respond "
"You're not the reason of his death. God, I can't imagine what you're going through right now. Family can sometimes consists of people who will rather drag you down rather helping you with your problems. I do not want to sound rude but your mother sounds like an exceptionally immature woman who's taking out her pain on you. Plus, she care more about having  a perfect image rather than caring about her child  Iknow it's tough to stay strong but I want you to be strong. 

If you want to speak with someone, I am here. And I mean it. Sometimes speaking with someone about your pain can help you lessen the burden on your shoulders. 


Take care."
"Inpatient facilities are usually considered to be a last resort.  To me, it doesn't sound like your wife would benefit from one.  They are usually used when mental health professionals are directly worried about the safety of the person they're admitting.  They also have the possibility of being traumatic and dehumanizing because a lot of the treatment is done without patient consent.

It sounds like your wife is suffering and needs help, but not inpatient, ""locked-up"" help.  What sort of care is she getting now?  If she's seeing a competent mental health care provider, they should have a pretty good idea of what type of treatments would be good for her.  Have you discussed this with her?  I think that working with her toward a shared goal of her health and happiness is what would be best for her.  Trying to get her committed against her will could breed serious mistrust in a relationship."
"Well first off, cut off all contact with this psycho, my ex was assaulted when she was drunk last year and she continued to talk to the guy, who continued to intimidate and manipulate her (unfortunately the bastard was in my friend group, I didn't realize he was a terrible person until it was too late, but he is gone now). 

Also, have you talked to anyone about this? You could go to your parents or someone you can actually trust, and you should definitely look into therapy. The feeling nothing about the incident was a form of repressing and self protection, but this will continue to plague you if you don't take action. 

One thing you should understand, which I only say because I have seen it before, is that THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. You went to a party to have fun and get drunk, but whatever coven of scumbags decided that they wanted to drug people. 

Good luck and I hope you feel better. "
"You're welcome, and thank you, too :). For the some of the ADHD components and BPD traits, I'd recommend The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook. I find it simple and easy to follow. It's great especially for emotion dysregulation, which is a symptom of both ADHD and BPD. I'd suggest this one first. If you're interested in Mindfulness, I have a few recommendations depending on what you're looking for. I know you only said you have BPD traits, but Mindfulness for Borderline Personality Disorder is an excellent read, and I believe has exercises that are useful and able to be generalized. Also, I haven't read this one personally, but I hear that The Mindfulness Solution for OCD is also a great read. Sorry this took me a minute to reply, got really busy yesterday. Hope you're well. Keep me updated and let me know if you have any questions about the stuff in the books! Happy reading!"
"it probably depends on the job, but i imagine it shouldn't be a problem. it would seem discriminatory to deny someone employment because of a mental health diagnosis. but i live in canada...not sure where you live. I haven't ever heard of someone being fired or denied civilian work because of mental health issues....potential employers don't have the right to ask you about mental health diagnosis.

i suspect that when you say you've faced emotional and psychological hardship, you're probably underselling it a bit...it's probably been a tremendous amount of hardship which has greatly impacted the quality of your life. And if that's true, i would advise you to get out as quickly as possible, in any way possible. Being in the military is hard enough, but being abused while an officer is even worse. You deserve to be safe. You deserve to be treated with respect. You deserve a moment of peace. "
"* Use your phone reminders app to set a reminder to take your medication
* Use a medication reminder app such as Medisafe or Round Health to set medication reminders
* Make taking your medications a part of your daily routine (i.e., always take your medication right after brushing your teeth in the morning, or after you wash your face at night)
* Keep your medication in a visible place (on your nightstand, by your toothbrush, on the kitchen counter)
* Keep a mini portable pill case with you with a few extra doses of medication with you in case you miss taking your medication or for some reason are not home to take your medication on time. 
* Use post it notes to remind yourself to take your medications (on your bathroom mirror, on your door, etc.)
* When you do miss a day (because it happens to all of us), practice some self-compassion. Take extra care of yourself to make up for the vulnerability of not take your medication instead of beating yourself up over it. Maybe practice a Loving Kindness Meditation. You're not alone in this difficulty, starting a habit like this can be tough. But keep trying, and be kind to yourself while doing so. "
"i mean, have you shot up a school? no? ok, then why do you tell yourself you're a school shooter? you mean like, you're afraid that's what you're gonna turn into one day..?

i have violent thoughts all the time and i don't feel bad because of them (at least i try not to), because those are just intrusive thoughts, and pretty much everyone has them. if you actually do those horrible things and then don't feel bad about it, then ok you're probably a psychopath/sociopath. i mean, just the fact that you feel bad about it, is more guilt than an actual psychopath would even be able to muster, right? true psychopaths and sociopaths have the inability to feel empathy or sympathy for anyone else. ask yourself, have you ever felt bad for anyone or anything? if so, then ok congratulations, you possess empathy!! something that psychopaths do not. if you're really worried, maybe do a little experiment in which you torture some small animals, preferably some cute and cuddly ones, and see if you feel anything lmao. if you slit open a puppy's throat and you're like ""meh, whatever"", then yeah i'm sorry but you're a sick fuck lol. a psycho, if you will. but if just the thought of this exercise made you recoil with disgust, then good news, you're like the rest of us.

as for the uh, not loving your friends and family, yeah idk that just sounds like you're depressed. do you also find yourself losing interest in everything else around you? depression and mental illness in general are extremely common, and i hope you can get help one day. in the mean time, look up ""intrusive thoughts"", it'll make you feel better. they're quite common and they're usually of a violent, sexual, or otherwise inappropriate nature. in my experience, the tricky part is constantly worrying like ""these aren't intrusive thoughts, they're just my own thoughts because i'm an asshole piece of shit who thinks horrible things"". but i know that's not really the case, just gotta keep telling myself that lol.

but anyways yeah, don't be so hard on yourself bro. and definitely don't shoot up any schools, you ass. oh and one more thing, sorry for the long comment, please don't be a dick to your family and friends, take it from me. even if you don't feel like you feel any love for them right now, they're your support system and they love you and want what's best for you so please don't alienate/push them away. that's the worst thing you could possibly do"

"My brother has this,but he was born with mentally retarded.. 

We have the opposite mental things.. you know.
Though its a coincidence."
"My sister does therapy via Skype so I’ll ask her about it later. Until then, I hope other redditors can help you out in the mean time"
"OMGOMGOMG YES to this. I get SO pissed when I hear these things.   


Good gracious, you just hit the nail on the head. Excellent post."
Pyromania hah. We are relatively poor but I try doing usefulish shopping. I just bought yarn for commissions so it is kinda justifiable
Sort of. I feel sick of being apathetic. I feel upset that I'm not even able to leave the house because it's actually too overwhelming.
Sounds like a little depression. It might help to talk to someone about this. There are treatements for it. I hope you feel better too.
Thank you. I hope I can actually apply it too.I need to stop being so afraid and just do it because the reward is so worth the struggle
"Thanks for your nice words. I checked your profile, you share your love all around. You're golden. I'm also sorry about your diagnose. "
Time heals all wounds. It may take a long time to feel better and understand it for the best but it will be ok in the end. Stay strong.
"Unless you’ve tried to kill your self before, you’re not taken seriously at all. What happened to intervening before it gets worse?"
Well i'm already very isolated! no one talks to me at school and my parents mostly leave me alone. Even ignoring that what should I do?
Would you be open to peer support programs where you get connected with people facing similar issues as you and hopefully feel better?
"You mention time stopping, colour draining out of the room, sense of dread, something evil happened.

Are these metaphoric or literal? "
"what does stringing me on mean?  And also, how are you doing right now man? If there's anything I can do to help you please let me know"
"I am relieved to hear other recovering alcoholics tried self harm and stimming as well.

&gt;  I am not sure if it is good for you or not. 

The self-harm and other ""weird"" maladaptive stress coping mechanisms were in place long before I took up alcohol, which replaced them. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's better than dying before 60 from alcoholism like half of my family tree."
"I do not care about their intentions, buddy. I care about what I receive as a patient. Some may think I am selfish. Well, of course I am selfish. I come to a doctor to get adequate treatment, not with some mercy and compassion so to speak for them. But that's just me, friend. I see professionals as people who need to properly do their job, not as some mercy and compassion-deserving people"
"I think you make a good point for people who do this. Sometimes I wonder if they are really trying to avoid actually getting help or working through difficult things when they do this. That said, in this situation I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing for OP to find a different therapist. I am much older than OP, but I don't think there is any way I would see a therapist that young. "
"It was extremely difficult, but most definitely worth it. Multiple times I walked into the counseling center at my university and left without talking to anyone or saying anything. I think it was my 10th time visiting that I actually filled out paperwork and spoke with someone. 

I know that this can be the most difficult step, and it may take a few tries, but I definitely believe in it. "
"Of course it’s ok to tell her to piss off out of the house. She’s an entitled, rude fuck wit. Without anyone telling her to piss off they’re condoning her behaviour. You all need to have strict boundaries with her. And don’t lay a finger on her - the second you do, she’ll call the cops and they’ll have your ass. She would love to get you in trouble. Don’t take the bait dude "
Ok. Gotcha. I guess it could work for that.  My trauma was over a period of time and done by the person I was closest with.  It definately got my brain stuck in the fight or flight mode.  And not getting it treated for 12 years made me quite a mess.  I never thought about  CPTSD until I stumbled upon it by chance.  Had I not found the therapist I am with now I don't think I would be here.
"PM if if you want someone to talk to. Graduate college out of state, graduated law school many states away, completed Masters' coursework. I made it, so can you. My parents didn't give a shit, and I was lonely too. PM me, any time. I'm a mostly happy 58 yr old female. Been thru bootcamp rehab, currently seeing an oral med psychiatrist. Been to thousands of hours of 12 Step meetings, too.
"
"People can say things like "" you. Need to change"" and you might take it as "" you are worthless. I know o often take it that way because they often do mean that. These are the types of people to avoid. But if a person is accepting of you as a person and they acknowledge the good strengths in you then you might finger it easier to listen to them. I agree with splitting when people hurt you."
"Trauma caused my mental illness. The way your brain is wired caused yours. 

Your mother needs an appointment with a therapist herself if she truly believes what she's saying. You might also find r/raisedbynarcissists a good place to take this, since I am genuinely concerned for your mental health at home if this is how she is about something that isn't your fault and you haven't caused. "
"I agree that it is an issue with security and attachment style too. You're looking for some sort of reassurance and reinforcement from an external source. It's obviously very difficult, but try to practice ways where you look for that validation and reassurance from within yourself. If you don't, you're going to spend a lot of time looking for others to give you that validation that you are a worthy person, and nothing is wrong with you/theres no reason for people to be mad at you. It's good that you can recognize that your thoughts vs. logic are incongruent, it's a sign you gotta dig a bit deeper to understand yourself more! Good luck :) "
"I lie to myself all the time, I lie to my loved ones all the time and I full well know what I’m doing. I can’t stop what I’m doing and I feel bad about it for about half an hour but after that I’m back to normal, I think I’m a sociopath but I’m not sure cause I do feel guilt for what I’m doing. I lie to my current girlfriend a lot and that eats me up pretty good sometimes, I feel stuck cause I’ve never been able to over come this, I’m 33. 

I usually live my life by a mantra of “as long as I’m happy” which sucks cause I find I take it too literal, anyway I’m going on too long with this but ya your not alone man.  "
"With all due respect to your situation, just a suggestion of looking into Buddhism. Namastè friend. Love is close to you. Take sometime and meditate for a few moments. Pause, breathe, reevaluate. Go on Google. Find a monastery near you. Call them and leave a message and talk to one of the practitioners. They as well as I care very much about humanity. That is why I choose to participate in this sub. I mean no harm friend.  I just wanted to offer a different idea to consider. I too have sins. As we all do. Your never alone. We are right here with you. 

Never above. Never below. Always side by side. Namastè and love to you my friend!! ❤"
"Sorry to hear you had to go through that!  

Depending on what you read and who you ask there is a tendency to indicate that emotional trauma is much worse then physical.  
That includes bullying.  

I went through plenty of that stuff myself, you are not alone :)  

And what your parents are saying is pretty shitty and they should be ashamed of that.  
Most people do not understand but ""stop being lazy"" is something extremely stupid to say.  
Your pain is real and they just wave it away with one hand, that is not fair.  
I heard that for the longest myself time and even told it to myself, when i finally was able to accept that it is not my fault and that my brain is just a bit broken, it helped me a ton to get better.  

But... from these few bit of information you gave me, it sounds like talking to a professional could help you pretty well, got my fingers crossed that it will happen soon!"
"Speaking from similar personal experience and professional diagnosis, this is depression. As far as being diagnosed, the cause doesn't matter.

I think your logic is sound. But I have found that life can't be fully analyzed by logic, and that's the part of life that's worth living for. I echo the words ""find something that makes existence worth it."" I hope you one day find that something/someone.

Very few people find life purpose in a job. Perhaps you are content in your job and contribute to society but have yet to find your true purpose in your personal life, which is why you don't think existing is worth it.

Perhaps also you have an above average IQ and/or tend to look at things logically. That's atypical and makes it more difficult to fit into the world. You can identify deeper societal issues, and yeah, it can be very depressing. Sometimes, there's something to be said for ignorance."
"I always thought I was just depressed as well. Once I got to therapy, and looked around for what else might be going on with me, I found BPD. I heared a lot of things about it, I’m a psychology student so I knew the name. I didn’t know what happened to me. It felt so shit. It felt so extremely terrible. I found the subreddit on BPD and I read all these positive uplifting things, but also the terrible stories where people struggle. It made me feel less alone. I wasn’t the only one feeling like this. I got diagnosed for real only like a month ago and I am still a little crushed. I lost my boyfriend to my mental mess, it got too much. I’m trying to accept that this is the way I am and I’m trying to look for the things that aren’t bad. One thing I always try to think about is that for me, the extreme emotions are one of the most major things, I feel the terrible emotions so deeply and it kills me, but I also feel the positive emotions very deeply. By that I mean, when I’m happy, I’m SO happy. And most importantly, when I love someone, I love so truly and unconditionally. It hurts when they leave, but at least I know I gave them all the love I had to give. There’s only a low chance of them finding someone else who loves them like this. Try to focus on the less bad things, there really are. Just look for them. I wish you all the luck in the world and I’m always here to talk to. "
"What do you want from life? Material things? Is that why you are going to school? To make a lot of money? What have you bought that has made you happy? Not a damn thing. We all have a calling. You should be going to school because you want to. Because you want to better yourself. To educate yourself on what you love to do. It's not about making money. Money just makes buying things easier. You don't need a lot of money for what you actually NEED in life. Food, shelter, and love. God provides all that anyways. Look at all the animals out there. God feeds them, doesn't He? He will do the same for you. Do you think they are worried about being remembered? That's all being 'successful' is. Actual success is happiness. Not being rich. Money won't buy happiness. Look at the president. That man has everything, but still isn't happy. A beautiful family. A beautiful wife. More money than he would ever need. As well as the most powerful job in the world. NONE of that makes him happy. Realize that God is real. That you are here for a purpose, and making money or being remembered isn't it. Becoming the best YOU is. Living like Jesus makes you happy. He tried to show the world that you have nothing to worry about. That God is in control. That being more like God, will make you happy. Doing good makes you feel good. Doing bad makes you feel bad. Remember that. God tells us how to live, so we can be happy. "
"Yeah. I'm pretty much in the same boat.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on pristiq. It really did help some. The worst of the depressive episodes stopped. The ones where you really just can't do anything besides put your spikes out and tell the world to fuck off and your brain just doesn't do anything but spiral out for a while.

But I still had really low energy. Like, brush your teeth once every 3 days and leaving the house for something besides work once a month is more than enough. Can't focus on anything. Still talking to myself and repeating things. Still uncontrollably fidgety.

Anyway. Long story short, I accidentally ran out in a situation I was 3 days away from being able to refill and fell ofd completely. Also during this time I was back at a new doctor trying to get the latter stuff under control. Turns out welbutrin doesn't do jack to me. So now I'm on just welbutrin that does nothing.

So now I spent a month on nothing to detox and sort out what was what. I'm starting lexapro tomorrow.

I had an ADD diagnosis at 13 and Major Depression at 18. But now I can't help but wonder if I'm just going schizophrenic or if I inherited my moms bipolar. Or if I'm autistic as fuck and nobody noticed because I don't interact with people.

Also did I mention I can't properly communicate the compulsive fidgetyness or the fact that leaving the house to go look at wedding venues with the love of my life sucks out my will to leave the house for a week. Or the fact its so bad I brush my teeth once every 3 days even after I just had a root canal and 4 cavities done.

Oh also its tanking our relationship because I can't get my shit under control and remember not to put shit all over the place until its too late. And when things go south I don't what to do besides stutter and try not to curl up into a ball because on some level I care about her and keeping our space clean. I just can't actually keep that in my mind and keep my mind present in the moment. I don't know if its neurological, emotional, or cognitive or what, butd its like I physically don't actually know how to be considerate of other people even when I want to be.

I want to just put in my 2 weeks and check myself into a psych ward and ignore the world for a few months. But I can't. I need to fix my shit and get us moved. I need to fix my shit so I can be the person she deserves. If I'm capable of that.

But...by the time I wake up tomorrow this entire tirade I ran out in the throws of a really bad episode will feel completely disocciated and I'll lose all the momentum I spent researching. That ended up with me here. I'm losing my mind.


Oh also I'm straight up delusional. I spend all day having entire conversations with people in my head. I know that the person I use doesnt hold those beliefs. its more just something to talk at and the face I attach is more about what tone im talking in. im sure its a coping mechanism developed from lack of human contact."
100% trust your gut. Not everyone who has mental health problems is abusive and not everyone who is abusive has mental health problems.
"Ah, I hadn’t considered that the forgetfulness may be more to do with the depression than the medication but it makes sense! Thank you"
"Btw, I'm  not a mental health professional or anything, I'm just a nutcase who's lucky enough to have a social worker as a best friend. "
Definitely recommend somatic experiencing. Don't need a trauma narrative to work through the trauma in the body. What is Tre by the way?
"Derealization is brutal. Grounding exercises can help, the more you practice the faster they can get you reconnected to the world again."
"Die inside? That does not sound good..

I love dogs, but my current living situation does not allow me to have any pets, unfortunately. "
Difficult to say why they treated you that way.  Its possible that they thought you were seeking drugs.  This is not uncommon in the ER.
"He needs to stop bottling his feelings then. It's not healthy and it's probably one of the reasons why he ""takes everything personally."""
"I empathise, I have similar feelings and wish I could give a better answer. For me, it is better to live and to experience; good or bad."
"I'm the same. A huge part of my life is just a blur, probably because I tried so hard to forget about it and just get away from it asap."
If you’re able to you should find out about counseling. If anything they can help with the intrusive thoughts and how to handle them.
"It used to be different until my 'pack' formed relationships internally, now I feel like a retired toy nobody longer wants to play with."
My advice to her would be to go to a different gym or work out at home. And it might be healthier for you two to stop taking for a while
"Oh my god. That’s a real thing????? I’m literally in tears right now from reading the posts on that subreddit. 

Thank you SO much. "
"Oh, I see. Yes me and you are very similar. I’m concerned though, because I have symptoms like peeing in two streams, stuff like that."
Same here. Ive been having a huge issue with following conversations and memorizing things. Also having problems concentrating in class.
So my body is depressed for no reason? And how do my symptoms differ from anxiety? And 3 different anti depressants didn’t do a thing?
Some sweet conflict resolution there. Why not just escalate the situation and antagonize the person intentionally? What could go wrong?
"Sometimes, I have an inner conflict where part of me sort of WANTS to feel depressed. I feel so guilty and ashamed for feeling that way."
That's what you read. I am just speaking the truth.  I was telling that person how to find happiness. Something you know nothing about.

Thought you were quoting Jim Carrey lol. I read every word in his voice. It hit me when i got to the living in London part though ��
"What are you looking for more specifically, what do you think would be an enjoyable frame for the way you might process stuck feelings? "
Yesss. I dont know why im afraid to sleep too...is it because we dont want to see that nightmares everynight? or is there any reasons???
Your post title is the most relatable thing to me today. It’s like I’ve already watched myself do it. It’s just a matter of when.
"bread, bagels, bananas, strawberries, apples, a spoon.
i’ve tried it on cake and it’s good on certain kinds. it’s good in oatmeal!"
mixing st john's wort which produces serotonin with herbal medications can trigger psychosis in some people so if you do that be careful
she listens to my problem gives me pills and that's all she does. No other hleps. I had to google around and get a book on DBT myself :c
"I'm in treatment for both depression and anxiety and my psychiatrist and I go off on random tangents, keeping up with the literature on this is a favorite: as far as he knows (and he knows his shit) science is not clear on the mechanism.

The analogy he likes is a thorazine injection for acute psychosis: it works, but don't ask us why, and don't substitute it for your normal antipsychotic."
"I've been told that I'm faking it before in the past. My head is so screwed up right now that it's a wonder I can even get out of bed in the morning. My PTSD has pushed me towards suicide on more than one occasion. It cripples me and nobody understands it. I'm so miserable.

I get how you feel man. And I want to see you get better. Therapy probably wouldn't be a bad idea if you're able to."
"Thank you. It's helpful to know that it's a broad phenomenon and I'm not falling just beyond the parameters. Currently the pain of a bite is what reminds me it's real -- like pinching yourself to wake up from a dream -- but I know that's not a sustainable coping mechanism. It's been about 12 hours since then though, and I've managed to get much of my feeling back, so that's good at least. "
Thanks so much. I also am anxious about my sexuality and when my VERY anecdotal geometry teacher said something like “when you’re telling your wife or husband...” I got anxious when he said “or husband” and felt like I turned gay even though that’s impossible(please note that I am not homophobic. I’m straight ally and am genderqueer myself). Also lots of love to you as well.
"This was one of the worst bits for me when I was going through the worst of my anxiety. I would have nightmares, and wake up with racing thoughts which would cause an anxiety attack. Honestly, the only thing which seems to have helped is medication, as well as getting up and out of the house. I know it's easier said than done, so im sorry. I know your pain, friend. I've been in your shoes."
Well tapering yourself off the meds is the way you're supposed to do it. So you're doing that right. The only way you'll get off these meds is to power through the withdrawals. At least that's what I've done in the past. It'll probably suck for a couple weeks but after that you should be fine. But I'm also not a doctor. So I could be wrong. I'm just telling you based off my own experience.
"Hi there. I know his may be frowned upon by others because some people think religion doesn’t have any stake in helping with mental health but I have to ask... Are you religious? Have you dabbled in or intentionally participated in occult practices? Doing that especially when not fully committed can cause thoughts and voices such as the example you have given. Have you tried prayer? Asking Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ) for forgiveness for sins known and unknown and help as to how to navigate this issue may help. Prayer to Yeshua asking where to find help or who can help you with this specific issue doesn’t hurt. 

Hope this helps. 

"
"I had a very similar situation when I first got help, I never talked to family about it and although I had a good mother, she just doesnt get stuff like this. I was also underage at the time (17) and I ended up having to tell her because I didn't want to hide it which would just have caused me more anxiety. Anyways I ended up going to the family doctor first where I got medication and a referral to a specialist, shortly after I started therapy. It was definitely worth getting help, that being said I don't think my mom will ever understand or even try. But that's just my personal situation, hopefully your family would be better in that part."
"I’m sorry to hear that. Shit really sucks when you’re mentally ill and haven’t found the right meds. I’m surprised that Wellbutrin doesn’t hinder sleep, etc., because it tends to have those same effects as duloxetine. 

I guess all I can say then is hang in there. Ask your doctors for alternatives. There are so many relatively new drugs out there for mood disorders and the like, and they aren’t yet common or well known at all. Antipsychotics might help, too. I don’t know if you’ve tried any but I’ve had a lot of luck with risperdal, especially when it comes to my mental stability. I’m sorry I can’t give better advice. "
"I can sympathize. My psychologist is younger than me, I’m 26 female, and she’s doing her residency. Not only that, I’ve been cycled through 3 psychiatrists who all are also in their residencies too. Now 3 years has past, all that happened is medication change after medications change. I’m finally trying to find new doctors with 10+ years experience so I can get better now but it’s been pretty hard. 

Though, I do believe since you feel this way, you should probably find another therapist. Your thoughts now will hinder your treatment and you’ll just be paying more money for sessions that may not help. But, I would stick with her until you can find another doctor because who knows how long the wait would be or if they accept your insurance. Or being positive, you might end up feeling comfortable to open up and she may actually help. Keep trying and stay strong. It will get better. "
"I have experienced this most of my life. For years I would constantly ask people if things were okay because I was sure they weren't, for no real reason. I still constantly worry that I've said something wrong, or that I might be misinterpreted, or I might offend someone else.

This is insecurity, which is a type of fear. It is an emotion, but emotions are neither valid nor invalid, they just are what they are.

It is possible that you feel insecure because of some incidents in your past where you were not treated well or were let down. You may also be predisoposed to anxiety. In my case, it is both, and I've spent years working on it.

You'll be okay. If you can, try to just accept for now that you are where you are. She is with you, she's not mad at you. 

And remember that you don't have to believe everything you think. This is a tough nut to crack but once you do, it makes things easier."
"**Macropsia**

Macropsia (also known as megalopia) is a neurological condition affecting human visual perception, in which objects within an affected section of the visual field appear larger than normal, causing the person to feel smaller than they actually are.  Macropsia, along with its opposite condition, micropsia, can be categorized under dysmetropsia.  Macropsia is related to other conditions dealing with visual perception, such as aniseikonia and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS, also known as Todd's syndrome).  Macropsia has a wide range of causes, from prescription and illicit drugs, to migraines and (rarely) complex partial epilepsy, and to different retinal conditions, such as epiretinal membrane.

"I honestly do not know. I would call the urgent care office and talk to someone, explain yout situation or ask for someone who would be able to advise you as to what to do.

I wouldn't just walk in, just in case they can't help and just refer you to a doctor that you already know that you will need and the only thing you have to show for it is a needless medical bill. 

It seems to me that you may need medication. The question is, and I don't know the answer, whether there is a medicine you can take NOW that works NOW to mitigate any negative effects of a post manic episode. If not, and all that you can take is one that will only work over a certain period of time then I would just wait to see a psych doc and take the meds they give.

But, again I would call the urgent care/other medical office and explain what happened and see what they tell you before you walk in.

I hope the best for you, be sure to buckle up because your mood may be unstable for the next little while. Be easy on yourself, get good sleep, eat good food, take a walk, watch an old movie you love. Do not strain yourself emotionally, if you have work to do in life that you know is going to sap you, then try to push it off if at all possible. And, if it gets too bad please reach out to the people in your life, matter of fact reach out before then even just having the ability to have your voice heard can be a very welcome relief."
"You're not wrong, and I expect that making photos look more professional was definitely their goal.

That said, everything you mention is a manipulation that the user is *aware* of. Even if they don't know that a professional photographer will retouch a photo, there is an understanding that they'll look better in that photo than their own. 

One may also argue that the type of person to take a bunch of selfies at so many different angles with any regularity may already exhibit some sort of self-esteem issue, which they're actively or just subconsciously trying to combat via validation from the same source that causes the issue.

The main concern, however, stems from the lack of awareness, as well as constant subjection to these retouched versions. It may very well be fine in the end, but at the moment, we already know that mental health can be degraded to the point of diagnosis by one's own perception of the self in comparison to others, and this has a potential to really exacerbate the problem nationally considering that iPhones are the most common phone in the states (and even globally). That is at the very least something every user should be made aware of.

Edit: mistaken details from updated research/accidentally not typing enough. Most common in the states among teens, still extremely damn common in the states regardless. Global use is prominent but Apple has a lower global market share."
"Because your psychiatrist believes you have GAD not OCD as you present closer to somebody with GAD and your symptoms fit more into a diagnosis of GAD not OCD. We are so close to ourselves it is very difficult to successfully diagnose ourselves, we can assume we have a condition so we look for those symptoms and ignore others. This is why I really do believe self diagnosis is an incredibly dangerous practice. Between conditions like OCD and GAD there are similarities and overlap, intrusive thoughts are a big part of both. I have horrendous intrusive thoughts, very similar to yours in fact, and that is a result of my anxiety not due to OCD.

You may read articles or blogs with people who sound like you, but again, this is like a self fulfilling prophecy. If you think you have something you're more likely to associate yourself with it, which is why self diagnosis is frowned upon, it's very fallacious. Also, these blogs and articles do not contain the whole story, to understand why they have the diagnosis you would have to understand their entire psychiatric history from the psychiatrists perspective, and you're not getting that in an autobiographical article. We also have a habit of doctoring ourselves to make ourselves seem better, the credibility of these articles would also be in question.

I would recommend following the prescribed treatment under the GAD umbrella. You might find it helps you quite a lot, then you know it helps. You have to remain open minded with your diagnosis, being closed minded will not allow you to heal. Also speak to your psychiatrist about the OCD and understand their opinion on the matter, may be they haven't considered it or maybe theres a reason for why it isn't OCD. Ultimately, asking through reddit will not be beneficial, we cannot offer anything more helpful than a suggestion to speak to your therapist again. You can't be diagnosed through reddit, or the internet."
"***Edit: Also, /u/Ryaubee is not a counselor. Please do not take advice from her. She is a writer and her behaviour on this sub is incredibly misguided and inappropriate.***

&gt;So firstly, you really can’t say, “I’m not justifying his behavior but...” then justify his behavior.

It's a good job he/she didn't do that then, isn't it? What was said is that we should try to understand it as an attempt at communicating an unmet need. 

&gt;You should acknowledge the fact that you are heavily implying that his behavior could be stemming from a childhood issue or internal struggle.

You're a poor counselor if you refuse to acknowledge that this may be the case... Given that it's almost always the case. 

&gt;I don’t need to know why he does something for me to say that something is abusive.

I'm with you here. But he may not understand that. We also have one side of the story and a severe lack of information about both parties present. This is an online forum and it's unethical of you to take sides and give specific advice here. You should know that. 

&gt;Since the husband isn’t here to explain his side, why do you feel the need to bring up the reasons for his behavior when we are discussing the impact it has on his wife?

That is exact why it's being brought up. This account is one-sided. Nobody is considering why he's doing it and that there may be other factors at work. The behaviour sucks and is potentially an indication of an abusive personality... It may also be the clumsy attempts of an emotionally unintelligent person to communicate something they feel is important. The simple fact is we don't know and shouldn't presume one way or another. What we should recommend is openly communicating and seeing a relationship counselor if that fails.

&gt;On a side note, there actually isn’t great research suggesting abusers were abused as a child.

There really is. Not every abuser will have been abused but many have. To deny that outright is silly. 

&gt;But when we give abusers a way out by relating it to abusive childhoods, they are less likely to be accountable for their behavior.

Nobody is excusing the behaviour... They are suggesting that there may be a cause which we can target.

&gt;I guess all I’m saying is that nobody here is trying to diagnose the husband.

Except you are. You and everyone else here is perfectly comfortable making sweeping judgements about a person you have never met, based on the biased account of one person with few details. You compared the man to a batterer for voicing his feelings for christ's sake. Not only that, you then go on to make recommendations about life-changing decisions one party should make without any clue what you're talking about. That is wildly inappropriate and you should know better.

&gt;Saying that I’m a hammer and only see nails is a bit of an insult to my professional opinion as a counselor.

From what I've seen, it's a compliment to your professional opinion as a counselor. You need to remember that you don't know these people, this isn't a counseling session and you are way overstepping your bounds right now.

"Agreed. 

I (forgive me for sounding strange in saying) enjoyed feeling a little scared and it of my element.  

Are you doing ok today? "
"Companies can choose to or not, the point of this is not to make money. I just wanted to see what ways people would want to be connected."
"Does this happen at night or day time? I have visual hallucinations similar to what you described, but only at night and when waking up. "
I have a friend who drew his own blood. And made me a badass painting of edgar Allen Poe with his blood and some black ink. Its amazing.
I have outgrown most of my meds at some point. Generally they just increase the dosage until we reach the max allowed then switch drugs.
I'd see if there's a NAMI chapter or outpatient group therapy program that you could go to just to gain a bit of stability in your mind.
"If you're going to stop taking meds, you need to slowly wean yourself off them. If you do that, the withdrawal symptoms shouldn't be bad."
"It's okay to feel this way, it happens to a lot of us! May I ask, is this in reaction to something that's happened, or a general feeling?"
"Look for a Licensed Mental Health Counselor instead. I hope that would be less expensive, and still a great resource for weekly therapy. "
Maybe you can try some free tools - such as our 100% free 2018 Graphic Mood Diary Platform - link: [www.bpzoo.com](https://www.bpzoo.com)
"Ptsd? Depression. Anyway you should see a psychologist, it's easy to make the first appointment. Just go once and see what they recommend"
"Sure. I'm in as long as I can stay anonymous. I can't let anyone else in my family or friends circles know about this ""condition"" I have."
Thanks I'm not gonna commit suicide. I'm really bad at it... no need for the number. Just ready to give up as I'll be homeless un a week.
Thanks man. &amp; both mentally &amp; physically I feel dreadful &amp; can’t bring myself to get up. Bad memories &amp; shit I suppose
"Thanks! Your explanation was really good!

There should be a personality test for checking if you’re addicted to personality tests lol!"
"That's fine, I haven't touched a drop in over a month just incidentally. Giving up alcohol in exchange for possible sanity it fine by me!"
That’s just lying if you say *everything* and *everyone* gets better. Or just being naive. But I do hope the situation improves for OP.
They're the same med. Sertraline is it's name here but most in the US would know it as Zoloft. I figured I'd put both names just in case.
Though you were depressed you knew you loved him? How? Did you feel something while kissing? Was that the reason you wanted to kiss him?
"Wish I could help, but my thoughts are pervasive and irresistible...I try to distract myself but it doesn't work all the time. Good luck."
Yep. It is hard...thank you so much. I appreciate all of you. I didn't think this would get THIS many hits. I can't say thank you enough.
"You need to talk this out with her. That's the only way she'll ever get over it. She needs to get these ""bad memories"" out of her system."
"I've just spoken with my doctor and he got my DNA results for the antidepressant interactivity. He wants me to start on Effexor. Very low dose. I'm absolutely terrified to try another medication at this point. 

Edit. After reading about Effexor I’m truly terrified. I have an appointment to see a psychologist next week. I’m going to wait until I speak with her before starting the meds. "
"Mental illnesses are defined by 2 things - a failure to function adequately, and a deviation from ideal mental health. From what I can tell, this behaviour already deviates from ideal mental health. If it starts getting in the way of maintaining an average lifestyle (stopping you from working or getting up, for example) you should see a doctor because it would 100% be classed as a disorder."
"My guess is you will receive a variety of anecdotes here which will do nothing to help you make a decision.

The best course of action is to make an appointment with your GP or a psychiatrist to discuss your specific concerns and symptoms. Allow him or her to provide several options for treatment and then discuss with you the risks, benefits, and side effects of each one before you decide. "
"I can actually relate somewhat, except turning the lights on everywhere in the house. I live with my Mum and I’m underage, so I can’t really just wonder around everywhere and turn everything on. I sometimes hear weird noises in my room too even though nothings in my room, I also hear walking in the attic, and hear noises under my bed. But I sometimes see creatures too at the corner of my eye, and I always feel like I’m being watched, it’s actually affecting my daily routines. I get scared when going to the toilet/showering. Please get help, this is horrible and I know how it feels, you don’t deserve this, please see a psychologist."
"I hope your recovery is going okay! And i’m proud of you for setting your own boundaries.

I have set boundaries of not talking calories and defining foods as “good” or “bad”. Of course, sometimes there’s slip ups with that, but that’s to be expected. I haven’t ever had her ask me anything like this before, so i didn’t realize there was a boundary to be set. My family isn’t together in one room very often and we never eat together, so there hasn’t been much need for a lot of boundary setting anyways. But I will keep this in mind and put it into action if she ever brings it up again! Thank you so much for the suggestion."
"Thanks for the reply.

I've tried a psychedelic once before with an ex-partner, it was a positive experience but I didn't really tackle these issues. 

In reaction to that relationship and paternal line addiction issues, I'm trying to wade through this completely clean. 

An instrument is a great idea though. Music has helped me to internalize things a lot. 

As an aside, do you think it's possible to deal with this independent of a therapist? I've seen a university counselor before but because I'm not in deep mental trouble the conclusion was that I should just keep on keeping on. I'm not sure how much clinical advice can help me with this."
"You make good points. I've been in OP's situation with a few close people in my life and it's always better to just let go. That's why I was so harsh about it, because being harsh is usually the best way to really get something in someone's head. 

The dude he described sounds like a narcissist and I'm sorry but you just can't help them. Trying to help him will only drag OP down. He is already a threat to his safety, how far is he going to let it go? He has shown him a hundred different red flags and it's time he listened to them. 

I know accepting that someone you love isn't good for you is a hard pill to swallow but it's a necessary one. "
"My psychiatrist informed me that medication probably wouldn't work for me because I have some other mental disorder which co exists with my schizophrenia. So the two disorders cancel the medication out. He said it was either ADHD, or SCT, or something else, but he wasn't entirely sure as I don't exactly fit either condition. all though, im betting its sluggish cognitive tempo, but that's only theoretical for now.

It tends to be triggered when im out in the public consciousness, but inside my house im mostly fine. Honestly a bigger issue for me is concentration and the voices; I never thought I use to hear voices before because I had them my whole life, but over the past few years they have become even more pronounced.

The scary part is: I was hit by a car before, which confined me to a wheel chair for 2 years when I was around 10. It's crystal clear now that the voices were partly to blame."
"Okay. I'm going to give you some pretty generic advice. You need to speak with a doctor about this. I'm not sure if you are currently seeing one, but if not, then you need to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. You need to tell them exactly what you have told us on here.

Also, I would highly recommend speaking with a therapist as well. It would probably help you in regards to your paranoia. And it would probably help you in regards to your other issues too. You need to find a way to get these negative emotions out of your system. And therapy would be a great way to do just that.

I can't tell you exactly what you might have since I'm not a doctor. But I struggle with a lot of your symptoms as well. And I've been dealing with this type of stuff for many, many years. Just try to take care of this as soon as possible. Don't waste time by putting it off.


Edit: Also, stop self-harming."
"Thank you for your honesty. IMO, it seems clear your coping mechanisms weren't/aren't that healthy, because all you were (and like still unintentionally attempt to) doing was repressing all the things that really did bother you. It sounds like therapy is bringing them back to the surface and making you deal with them now. It really sucks that things tend to get worse before they get better (always darkest before the dawn).
I do echo the sentiment of the others when it comes to medication. I know it's been enormously helpful in my case to have both therapist, and a separate psychiatric nurse practitioner who prescribes medication. It's a long, often frustrating road, and many days look and feel dark and hopeless, but it can and does get better. It just takes dedication to your recovery and hard work.                                                 
If you don't mind my asking, how old are you?"
"Thank you so much for your response.

Well, my gf often insists even though I say no, when I finally tell her that she's pressuring me she gets pissed off and doesn't talk to me.

As for my co-workers, I'm looking for another job in my city (I moved here to live with my GF) and thinking about suing the company, I will get legal advice on Monday.

Thanks for your concern, I know it can get better, It needs to get better, I often think about the possibility that this is my only chance to experiencie reality itself, to experience the universe, to live my life, it's such a shame to having to waste my time making my boss richer, making people happy, making my gf happy and I'm here spending most of my days suffering.

So, yeah, I know, there's no shame in admitting that I'm not happy, and there's no shame in getting help, It's been 10 years of my life with anxiety, I think it's time to get better.
"
"So this sucks. This is one of those feelings that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. It's a feeling of loss where you feel a literal hole in your chest. 

It's ok to cry, eat junk food, watch sad movies and listen to sad songs and repeat....but only for a couple days. You're going to have to cope, but you're going to need to do it in healthy way so that you don't spiral into harmful habits- which is easy and common when in moments of distress. Right now, this is an unexpected transition. Everything was forced to change out of the blue and it really does suck...but you will get through this. 

No one wants to face difficult situations in life - a breakup/divorce, loss of job, sudden death of a loved one etc. But when we get through those difficult times, we grow. You are going to grow from this. The hardest part is that you'll have to continue your routine with life and it's going to make you feel uneasy but reach out to people and talk about it. Everyone has experienced some kind of heart break. Don't isolate yourself into a depression. If you need more time to heal, take a break from life and have some days to yourself. 

I hope this helps :)"
"Have you heard of mindfulness meditation? The idea is that you sit still, eyes closed, and focus on nothing but your breath. In doing this, you will notice thoughts arise in your mind. Almost immediately, you will become lost in thought. The usual things that rattle around in your head will start to loop around. When this happens, the idea is that you merely notice those thoughts and then return to focussing on your breath. You're not trying to shut them out - you're just trying to notice them arise and then disappear, using your breath as the focal point, the thing you can return to each time that you notice that you're lost in thought.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm telling you about this is because if you do it, you may notice thoughts arise, seemingly from nowhere, that are revealing about what going on ""behind the scenes"" in your mind. It can be very useful to ""hear"" yourself think these things when you're in a position to really take notice of them. Once you've mastered the ability to snap out being ""lost in thought"" and concentrate on the breath, it can become something of a super power.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE**: mindfulness meditation is **hard**. You will constantly become lost in thought. This is normal and the same for everyone. Do not become frustrated. Each time you bring it back to the breath, you're practicing and becoming better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you decide to try it"
"On balance, therapy should make you feel more of who you are, in a good way. You should be finding strength, resilience, personal resources, empowerment, coping strategies, and insights through the work.  Your relationships and general functioning should improve, steadily and observably. If you are finding therapy gruelling, and you are getting inconsistent observable results, then you are almost certainly with a therapist who is not working well for you. Im absolutely not saying it should always be 'painless', but it sure as hell shouldnt consistently be like being dragged over the rocks.

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing about therapy is its very individualising. There's no escaping the fact that it can be a very lonely experience, especially if it makes you feel intensely like you are the only person going through what you are going through. **Trust me, you arent.** There are commonalities to all of us with mental health problems, and support in the community can be really empowering and a great way to offset the isolationism that can happen with 1:1 sessions. If you havent tried group work, it might be really helpful with where you are at. Reason being, it is healing being around other people who are struggling; both hearing their stories and using our own experiences to support others. For many people, group work is preferable to 1:1 therapy for these reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps."
"That's really tough. I'm sorry you went through that shit. It takes time before you will feel ready to try. But with every single person, there's a risk of getting your heart broken, so there will always be a bit of nervousness about letting someone in, because what if they abuse your trust? You can never know for sure. I was terrified of falling in love the last time, because my first boyfriend broke up with me, said I wasn't worth it, then wanted me back, then broke up with me again and I felt like a big fool for trying with him again. But there will be people who are strong, that you can lean on, who won't abuse your trust, who will be healthy for you and teach you real love which will make you healthier and stronger and happier. So it's worth trying to find love when it's the real and healthy thing.
I think the best way to learn how to trust again is putting yourself out there into the world - not hiding in your home all the time. But meeting new people through school, work, dating websites etc. and then when you see someone you think you might like, date them and slowly open up about yourself - don't give them all your information right away, but little by little, tell them about yourself and then before you know it, you'll know this person well and they'll know you well and they fall for you and you for them. And you have to trust your gut instinct. It often tells you something important."
"Sure! (If possible) Before seeing a professional, I recommend writing down any symptoms you're experiencing along with context like a brief summary. It can be hard to just write without any direction, so hopefully the questions below can help give some guidance. I compiled the questions I've been asked at my own appointments. You don't have to write down your answers to all of these questions, although you are certainly free to do that. There's also no pressure to write anything down at all, but I do recommend taking a look at the questions below so that you can start thinking of what to say. Keep in mind that the professional just wants to get a clear picture of your life, so that they can give you the best care possible. Their intention is NOT to interrogate you and get you to confess a crime. They want to help you get better, and in order to do that, they need to know details about your life! When you're finished, consider bringing this paper and just show it to the professional because that can take pressure off of you to perform on the spot! Here are the questions:
	
&gt;1. what would you like help with?
&gt;2. what are your symptoms?
&gt;3. when did your symptoms first start?
&gt;4. how often do your symptoms occur? All the time? At specific times of the day like before bed or when you wake up?
&gt;5. how severe would your symptoms on a scale of 1-10? Rate the quality of your life on a scale of 1-10.
&gt;6. how are your energy levels/motivation? High, normal, low, very low?
&gt;7. how is your appetite? Are you eating too much, too little, or a normal amount?
&gt;8. how is your sleep quality (good or bad)? How many hours of sleep per day? Do you feel well-rested?
&gt;9. have you lost interest in any hobbies or passions?
&gt;10. do you isolate yourself from others? 
&gt;11. what is your school/social/work/home life like? (basically, the professionals want to know if your    struggles are impacting different areas of your life and how much. For example, if you're in school and you're failing classes because you're depressed, it's important to say that you're failing classes)
&gt;12. how is your ability to focus and retain information? 
&gt;13. do you think anything has contributed to the way you are feeling like the death of a loved one?
&gt;14. how are your stress levels? How stressed do you feel on a daily basis? Anything causing stress like work or school? 
&gt;15. do you have a family history of depression/anxiety/anything else?
&gt;16. have you had any thoughts of ending your life and/or harming yourself?
&gt;17. have you harmed yourself or attempted suicide?
&gt;18. do you experience racing thoughts?
&gt;19. how would you describe your self-esteem? High, low, etc.
&gt;20. do you feel nervous often? When do you feel nervous? All the time? In front of others? Alone?
&gt;21. how would you describe your sex drive (none, low, medium, high?)
&gt;22. do you feel fatigued? How often are you fatigued/exhausted?
&gt;23. how often do your symptoms occur? Sometimes, all the time, rarely?
&gt;24. have you gained or lost weight recently? If so, how much?
&gt;25. do you experience any body aches? Joint pain?
&gt;26. do you feel like you move or talk slowly? Have others noticed this?
&gt;27. have you experienced a sudden onset of anxiety like a panic attack? how would you describe this panic attack/sudden experience of anxiety? Does it happen in crowds, alone at home, randomly, during sleep?
&gt;28. do you ever feel hopeless? If so, how often? Or like you've let yourself or others down?
&gt;29. are you taking any medication and/or supplements? If so, which ones and how much?
&gt;30. do you use any drugs in a recreational manner? If so, how much and how often?
"
Basically what you are saying is they have a business plan that is dangerous.  This type of thing is not a good introduction to therapy.
"But, how can a doctor correctly identify a problem for which to prescribe meds if they don't talk to the patient for more than 10 minuteS?"
Definitely bipolar but seems more like Type 2 due to lack of depression which is more likely in Type 1. Put him on lithium and haloperidol
I am here too for anyone!!! I love that you've reached out and made this post. I'm sure somebody needed this today. bless u kind stranger
I don't sleep a lot.  I used to get 0-3 hours of sleep per night.  Up to 4-8 now.  I get random pains but I wouldn't call them/it chronic.
I found a therapist that offers 'financial aid based on income for my visits. Normal visits are $30 but with aid it's been reduced to $15.
"I have considered it but I don’t feel I exhibit many ocd tendencies that I’ve read about. Is it possible, sure but I don’t think so "
"I know what you mean, but you're going to be tired everyday, you just have to push through it, you have someone here that believes in you."
"I know, but it’s only a theory, which we cannot prove or disprove. What I find surprising is how he seems to take it almost like a fact."
I read this book and loved it. As a massage therapist it was also nice to get some recognition that our work can benefit those with trauma
"I second this!  You can sort by insurance, gender, age group, issues they specialize in, religion, and more.  Narrows it down super well. "
I'd recommend talking to a professional. Self diagnosis is nearly always a shitshow so I'd suggest getting tested as soon as you're able.
"Idk. I currently talking with a therapist through it. Maybe I got lucky? He's been quite helpful. But, I'm not suicidal, so there's that. "
If you like how you are why go to a therapist? Your inconsistency gives you away. It feels like you want attention rather than help here.
Its possibly anxiety and that’s why it got written off. If it’s only when you sleep then that could also be hypnagogic hallucinations
I’m 19 and feel the same way. I’m convinced I like being alone and not worrying about socialising but I think I’m really struggling
"My wife has known me since I was 14, she has a pretty good idea when things are different with me. I tried not to tell her, but she knew. "
My-brother-in law told me to my face I need help. He hadn't known me long enough to build up the same sentiments as my sister and parents.
Nice lol. I need one. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's and Autism and GAD. I also suffer from insomnia during the summer (don't ask).
The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. Also check out Kati Morton on YouTube. She has a ton of vids on dissociation and trauma.
"Try some aromatherapy at the same time by using products with scents that you love- it sounds simple, but this can be a real mood booster."
You are more comfortable knowing that they hate you than wondering if they like you. It's easier because you know for sure where you stand
so your anxiety has expanded from asking someone out to also include going to work or it's only when going to work?  do you like your job?
"A therapist will not think either of those things. We’ve heard it all. You’d also be surprised at how resilient people can be given where they’ve been and what they’ve come from- I know I constantly am amazed and impressed by the human spirit. 

Go and talk to someone who can help you process what’s happened as well as develop the tools you need to cope with where you’re at now. "
"Because I feel like I’m always fighting. It’s an uphill battle and when I finally make it close to the top I usually feel like I get pushed back down and have to start over. 

I know I’m being a little over dramatic. I know I’m making progress but it just seems like it’s never ending and as I progress the road ahead feels like it gets longer and longer. 

Thanks for your response! "
"I feel ya. I am in the middle of a mental health crisis, and my wife of ten years has just told me she's leaving. We've been together almost half of our lives, and I literally don't know how to function without her.

I know how you feel. Somehow, hopefully, it's gonna get better. Even if you don't have your friend, you still have all of us internet strangers to turn to. We'll always be here."
"I wasn’t trying to look for an actual diagnosis, I just wanted to know if theres a name for it for me to deal with it properly. 
Thank you guys anyway, I’ll be going to a therapist soon and hope things go well, it hasn’t been a good year and I’ve been dealing with insomnia but I’ll try to be more optimistic and less cynical about everything. 
Hope you guys get better soon as well. "
"I’m not really wanting to pay a ton for counselling if it seems like my “issues” could just be solved by trying to overcome it by myself. If I can just teach myself to get over these things without help then that’d be great but if they seem like more serious issues then maybe a counsellor is the best route. Your answer kind of seems like a cop out, but thanks for the answer anyways. "
"Thank you, you are exactly right. I can't keep this up. I will go to my GP today I was in two minds as I really worry about being turned away, having been made late for work by going and making everything worse as a result. My local practise are a lovely bunch of people I have yet to meet a bad one there ( met some awful doctors elsewhere though). I will put it across like you said thank you"
There are a lot more medications out there than 2 so my advice would be to keep trying. I know it is frustrating and exhausting but it can take years to find the right one. If they still don’t help then I would try TMS or ECT. I know shock therapy might sound scary but it is not like you see in the movies. It is pretty safe and the only side effect might be a bit of temporary memory loss.
"Wishing you and your family well. I hope he realizes he can't make such treats to his girlfriend, even if he feels like the ground falls away is he loses her, when he talks like that he will lose her. It is not healthy. But maybe he was /is a lot more desperate than you all thought and it was a cry for help. And maybe yall can go and find the right help now. Help that fits him.
Kind wishes. "
"Yes, it took me 10 years from the point I figured out that there is something seriously ducked up with me, and now I'm 32 and can say that I'm much, much, much better.

It took drugs, life changes, a sleep test and what two employers described as ""attitude"" to fix myself. 

The most important things were Ritalin (after a year of being told it was bp2) and the sleep study. And low fodmap diet"
"aw thank you lol no I’m not anywhere near publishing stuff, it was just a class assignment that I’m thinking I can take parts from to turn into a thesis. I feel like it’s a little scattered (I tried to center a paper around exploring current anti-stigma campaigns and suggesting improvements) but if you’re interested you can totally read it. It’s like 30 friggen pages, fair warning "
"Do you have any idea how ignorant you are about mental health issues?   It's not as easy as ""grow a set"".  
And I've gotten to the point where I don't care that it would hurt other people  - the only ones I'm concerned about are my dogs. 

I didn't think about police...but I'm a white female, so that may be difficult to accomplish. 

So we're clear, I don't loathe myself;  I'm simply exhausted from living with my mental issues and my physical handicaps.  It's like exiting a video game if the level is too hard; you don't hate the controller, you just can't fail the level for the 689,000th time, so you turn off the game and go play tic tac toe."
"For me, it's always been hard. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 14 and it's been a long road since. Lots of crying, hiding, ditching out on stuff I wanted to do all because of my past. Eventually you build up the good things as time goes on, which overtakes what has happened to you. It might take a few months or decades, but decades of small happinesses would have never happened if you hadn't experienced them.

Just look at the good in the past, and when the overwhelming horrors you've had creep back in, think of the present and how far you're along your ride on this big rock. The blessings and all those small happinesses are worth it in the end."
"I am having a ""delayed reaction"" to crap that had happened to me when I was a kid, and I am 47 now. This one problem, which I am battling now besides the Depression and Anxiety, had been hidden for all this time (2-1/2 decades or more!) and is now just finally coming out. That is what makes it so hard for me to be taken seriously. A 47 year old woman with a family and kids doesn't do this juvenile stuff...but alas, I have been diagnosed, and it is true. So, it doesn't have to happen right away. These kinds of things can and do sneak up on you when you are least expecting them. I would definitely get checked out and talk to someone. Good luck!"
"Thank you so much..  this gives me some shed of light. I'm going to open up to his step dad and see if he can atleast consider it. I'm terrified to end up like my parents.Due to not being raised right I was never pushed and don't have any hobbies really.. I don't know what I'm good at but I want to be good at something.. and I'm not really sure what I'm going to make of myself.Right now a main goal is to leave here and start new. I just hope it doesn't take too long.. 

As for you, you're not alone ! It's nice to have a place like Reddit to connect with people and remind us that there are people out there that are going through things too. 
 "
"I had the same problem when I was in school. I felt like everything was a mountain I had to climb even when it was simple to do. Try studying/working on what you need to for 20-30 minutes and reminding yourself that you don’t have to be doing it all day. It’s surprising to realize how much work you can get done in 30 minutes instead of stressing yourself out the entire day and leaving everything till the end. That’s what makes it feel like it’s too much. 

As for the volunteering, I had to do that to gain one of my scholarships. I was freaking out about calling different places to see if I could volunteer with them. Once I made the initial call, I felt so much better. It’s the one little speed bump that you need to get past and everything goes a lot smoother after that.

I’m not sure if this was anything that you could take as advice, but I hope that you realize you’re not alone."
See a doctor and a psychologist. They are two sides of the same coin. Medication is important but won’t fix all your problems. You need therapy on top of this. Also exercise. In my opinion everyone with mental health needs to exercise and basically treat it as if they have no choice. This is what my doctor told me to do and it has helped immensely. It has been scientifically proven to work just as well as anti depressants. Also try to get genetic testing and blood work done to rule out any problems that are known to cause this. I ended up being hypothyroid and have a genetic mutation that causes me to not produce a certain enzyme which the brain uses. I started taking activated folate. This is a vitamin that is already broken down outside the body because my body can’t break down the form found in nature and normal vitamins. It helped a lot. They can also see what drugs work best for you.
"You may be overdoing things. It's admirable to want to make changes in your life, but if you try too much it can stress you out and backfire.

You've quite smoking and drinking. Did you know that nicotine and alcohol are usually considered 2 of the 5 most addictive substances known? They are right up there with heroin and cocaine. And you dropped weed as well. 

And you're on your period so your hormones are all over the place.

Timing matters, and so does taking your time. Give yourself a break. I am reluctant to tell you to start using addictive substances, but if you are the point of considering self-harm it may make sense to back off, wait for your period to end, and then tackle these one thing at a time.

Also, try to get some support from a local addiction recovery group and/or a therapist if possible.

Wishing you good luck. You should be commended for trying to make these improvements."
"I force myself to walk 1 hour a day. I've got two dogs. Keeping busy hasn't helped me, it only makes things worse. I try to do small things or things that should be fun. I eat healthy, I take vitamin D and iron (because of blood loss from selfharm), I checked my thyroid. My blood sugar is good, blood pressure is good. Apart from being overweight because of the meds, I'm completely healthy body-wise. I've tried taking up hobbies or just playing with the dogs or being in nature, getting some sun and whatever else is considered healthy. I'm still so depressed that I wish I could just kill myself. I'm in a toxic environment and around lots of toxic people, which my psychiatrist says I have to get away from in order to heal, but I can't cut them out of my life seeing as they're my parents and I still live with them. Trust me, I've tried every mental health tip I've ever gotten but I'm still getting worse by the day. Ever since I was 12 I knew that one day I'd kill myself. I don't think that day is very far away anymore. I've tried so much, I really have. I WANT to get better but nothing seems to work, not even selfharm anymore. I just want it to end"
"Have you heard of mindfulness meditation? The idea is that you sit still, eyes closed, and focus on nothing but your breath. In doing this, you will notice thoughts arise in your mind. Almost immediately, you will become lost in thought. The usual things that rattle around in your head will start to loop around. When this happens, the idea is that you merely notice those thoughts and then return to focussing on your breath. You're not trying to shut them out - you're just trying to notice them arise and then disappear, using your breath as the focal point, the thing you can return to each time that you notice that you're lost in thought.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm telling you about this is because if you do it, you may notice thoughts arise, seemingly from nowhere, that are revealing about what going on ""behind the scenes"" in your mind. It can be very useful to ""hear"" yourself think these things when you're in a position to really take notice of them. Once you've mastered the ability to snap out being ""lost in thought"" and concentrate on the breath, it can become something of a super power.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE**: mindfulness meditation is **hard**. You will constantly become lost in thought. This is normal and the same for everyone. Do not become frustrated. Each time you bring it back to the breath, you're practicing and becoming better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you decide to try it."
"How is there awareness for ASPD? I wouldn't call ASPD, NPD, or BPD as having any more awareness than DID does by *Split* being a popular movie.  

Like DID, it's mostly only known through fiction misrepresenting and stigmatising it... which would be like saying everyone in a racist community is aware of black issues because they're talked about a lot--they're violent criminals, after all!  

To inform people a bit about it:

It's a diagnosis almost exclusively associated with serial killers and psychopaths (which if you go by Hare's PCL-R, only even 1/4 of people with ASPD *in the prison system*, who are already often violent offenders, are the latter). When it's not associated with them, people speak nonsense about anyone else with it being a CEO like it's a big joke.  

As well, it is often used in the justice system to judge people as more likely to reoffend and to give them harsher sentences. Imagine if any other mental health issue was used as commonly this way, there'd be outrage! Most research on it is performed on people with it *in the prison systems*, who are convicted criminals, as if that's a fair population to judge an illness on.

The far larger vulnerable demographics that it's actually disproportionately represented in--such as victims of trauma, people who grow up in poor environments with high rates of crime, and *especially* people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol, are ignored, cast aside, and rarely ever helped or diagnosed.

Youth with its precursors such as conduct disorder are rarely helped (or even diagnosed) either, and looked at like nightmares for others around them rather than people suffering from mental illness."
"The fact that you are angry shows you still have a spark of life, a will to live left in you. Fan the flames of your anger, by letting it out constructively. You have probably lived in fear for a very long time, most people are afraid before they get angry. Anger is a defense mechanism, it is not an ends to itself. Anger exists to keep you alive.

But what happens when you have really let it all out? Well you will feel empty, and cowardly dog of fear will try to creep in. But your defense isn't more anger, anger isn't in season after you have really channeled it. No, breathe in. breathe out. breathe in.... out. Emptiness. 

It starts in the fertile soil of the void. If this sounds too abstract and corny, then that's okay. I only mean to offer a suggestion. 

You are angry now, and though you end your post with a vow to end your life, I don't think you will. Not because I think you are weak or a coward, no I believe you be the quiet strong. But, your anger will not last, emotions are transient and subjective events that come and go. Emotions do not define who you are, pain and fear DO NOT define who you are DAMMIT. You have lived through so much, felt so much. You just want the pain to go away, you want love. You just want the fear to go away, you want security.

You deserve love and a realistic measure of security.

Please, talk to someone. Call someone. Reach out. Suffering doesn't have to have the last laugh. I bet for a very long time you have defined yourself not in terms of who you actually are, but in how you think other people define you to be. Relationships are mirrors, they reflect who we are. A human being is relational, we need others. You have been around toxic people, broken mirrors that refuse to reflect the beautiful image of person that you are, that you are meant to be.


Please reach out, don't do it for me or someone else, but do it for yourself. Your worth it.

Feel free to PM."

Aw I'm sorry if you didn't want to hear the word I'm the exact same way but with my bipolar. The word bothers me a lot :/  and thank you :)
"Do you always feel this way, or does it come and go in waves? Do you ever feel compassion for people? Do you care what others think of you?"
Does your therapist offer to let you email them? If yes then you can tell them you are having a hard time. Or tell them next time you meet.
Have you talked to a doctor about this? Because I was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year. I'm currently on medication for it right now.
"How long has it been since you acted out on the violent thoughts? 

Re-reading your post now it seems like you're almost drowning in guilt."
I had Betterhelp for a few months before I found an in-person therapist. I liked the service and was lucky to get a really kind therapist.
"I know right? Thank you so much! I thought I was being irrational. I'm too scared to tell my parents, I'll go to another therapist for now."
"I take some solace from the fact that maybe I can help and make a positive impact somehow.

Thank you so much for that, it means a lot. ❤"
I think they will be comprehensible. But I can't be sure. And I have some problems doing/saying stuff I am not sure what the outcome can be

Learning difficulties of any kind are very common. You shouldn't feel ashamed or embarrassed. Are your parents aware? Do they try to help?
Maybe.  Been feeling worse then normal.   Not suicidal or anything.  Just feel a little manic being the closes term to describe how I feel.
"Okay then to play devils advocate, if he did that for attention, what makes you think he isn’t making these statements for attention too?"
"Sometimes, I just answer ""no"", most of the times it's no answer or robot answer ""fine and you? "" but when in a good mood, ""could be worse""."
Sounds like it may be anxiety and possibly PTSD (I can't say for sure though!)...I would go get it checked out. I hope you can feel better!

Yeah that’s why I have a young-ish male therapist. Most younger women are threatening and older people have been too out of touch for me.
Yes. People don't understand it because I don't talk about it and try to act like everything's ok. I'm not gonna start whining to everyone.

"Are you serious? I agree it's wrong but if they DO love their children it is a thing that can be easily fixed by education and understanding. It's not like anyone who gives their child bad information at any point should be banned from parenthood.

"He's in a hospital now on a 72 hour hold. Perhaps his medication isn't working properly. There are multiple factors here. I will love him through this. Again, I consider him my son. I don't like some of his behaviors, that is a given. I know he isn't perfect. I just want him to get help. Maybe once he gets the help he needs and realizes some of his behaviors he will feel better about himself."
"I'm always having a mid-life crisis because I never know at which point will be the middle. 

Best to just assume that your 20s are for trial and error, and realizing that what other people are doing may not be what you need to do. No one is on the same path or going at the same pace, and that's okay. Try different things. You don't have to figure it all out all at once or even get it right. "
"I've got plenty of motivating factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic.  My therapist helped me with this a bit by reinforcing the idea that I wasn't being ""lazy"" but just lacked motivation - previously I was piling on the blame on myself, which just made matters worse.  [Some potentially interesting reading for you](https://www.brainmdhealth.com/blog/7-ways-to-boost-dopamine-focus-and-energy/)."
"It would definitely be helpful for you to seek diagnosis from a doctor. I have BPD, which shares a lot of the symptoms you're describing. Not saying that's what you have, just that the two are often misdiagnosed and it would be helpful to seek a clear diagnosis from a professional. For the symptoms you've described, I've found DBT to be very effective, as well as medication and proper sleep. "
It's torture for me to go out in public also. I only leave the house to go to doctor's appointments. I just assume that everybody just wants to hurt me. I can't even go to the doctor's office without feeling like I'm under attack. I currently see a psychiatrist but it's extremely difficult to force myself to go there. I understand how you feel to some extent. I would rather just stay at home.
"Thanks for sharing your feelings. I agree with a lot of people about writing it down in a notebook or a mood journal. The other thing is making video diary entries, if your not a big writer. Sometimes its nice to share your feelings with a support group. There are lots of them that are online and in person ones. Check out https://adaa.org

"To put in perspective my friend told me 'don't loose anymore weight, you'll end up unable to walk and In a wheelchair from malnutrition, and it doesn't look nice to anyone else but you'. I sought help and now am healthy thanks to that one conversation where someone treated me like a human in need and not someone to tiptoe around in case of upsetting. Don't collude with the illness, fight it. "
"Oh I'm sorry. It might have been me that misread it. Idk I just don't feel good at all. Losing a close friend who I put a lot of work into keeping her in good spirit which I've been praised for by a lot of people and then have her mum accuse me of all this. Now it's just getting worse because she's spreading it to other parents and in the last half hour I've lost another three friends. They can question me, call the cops on me and get a psychiatrist or whatever to search every single bit of me but I can assure you and I can assure myself, that none of what she has accus me of is true. It just felt bad having someone overpowering you like that."
"Thank you. 

I currently do take out student loans to pay my tuition Moving out is hard due to my low income and layoff... but it’s an option and a coworker offered to rent me a room.. which I’m considering. It just sucks because I was trying to stay financially ahead... start an emergency find and savings.... which is also why part of me thinks I should just suck it up and deal with my parents (for free rent). 

I will definitely look into scholarships!!! 

I know millions of Americans do this and I have no desire to give up whatsoever.... I just... it sucks feeling like you aren’t worth pursuing your dream. 

Thanks for your response! "
"That mental illness does not excuse behavior. This has been a big one recently for me. It doesn’t excuse behavior, but it gives insight into an explanation for behavior. I think this mindset (“your mental illness doesn’t excuse your behavior!”) is really unhealthy because it shames people into thinking they can’t recover after doing something horrible because they’re such a bad person, which makes a self defeating positive feedback loop of regrettable behavior. This goes for pretty much everything you can think of in my opinion. There’s always an antecedent to behavior and severe medical illness can absolutely be an “excuse”."
"The ""Turn it on and off again"" of mood/anxiety/depression/focus/motivation, aka the ""do these before assuming it's something more serious:

&gt; I'm on a diet so I don't randomly eat half the day anymore.

Quit masturbation and all drugs/alcohol as well.

"The funny thing is, before I even read the context of this question, I was going to say something about the army. I have recently discovered that I want to be a combat medic, but I can’t due to being diagnosed at a mental health facility/self mutilation scars. I’m automatically disqualified. Now, as far as my current job (I am a nursing assistant), and previous jobs, I have had no issues with my mental health being a factor. I’m not sure if you mean as in HOW it affects your work ethic, or if you mean do jobs check on those kinds of things. Either way, I wish you luck in transitioning back to civilian life. It is not an easy thing to do."
"I feel the same a lot of the time and have recently been having conversations with my counselor about it. She says avoiding anxiety about the future is all about grounding yourself in the present, which is aided by mindfulness and physical activities which focus your concentration of present sensations and thoughts.

She also made the fair point that anxiety is based on negative imagining of future events, so a different perspective can be found by allowing yourself to explore the alternative. What is the GOOD version of the events you fear? Or even just a neutral version? All of these are imagined and so in a way you can choose to ignore the bad version sometimes and lose yourself in the imagined better alternatives.

Finally the best point she made to me that really hit home. Feeling anxiety about the future by definition means that in the present you are safe and secure. And that is a feeling you can latch onto. Because if bad things were happening in the present, you would be acting, not feeling anxious. Or in the words of Hannibal Lecter 'You must convince yourself that the lion is not in the room. If it were, I assure you, you would know.'"
"I have the same symmptoms so I can give you a few words of advice.  
First of all, youtube adicction. Try to change it. I know it's hard, but you can probably find a substitute. (In my case, adicted to videogames. The way to solve it was social games, such as World of Warcraft, where you get into a guild, then you talk with people in discord; and in the end your adiction lets you socialice in a way you enjoy and still not feel vulnerable). Try to make something good out of your adiction. If you liek youtube, try channels about science, or programming, or someting that will make you learn things and feel like you are not wasting time.  


Then, think of it, you have a free working imagination. You could  make stories and quests for films, books, videogames, etc. (In my case specially videogames but idk about your tastes). I recommend trying to search for some art (not classic realistic art that feels like studying or so, but contemporary art, here on reddit there are good subreddits like imaginarylandscapes or things like that. You could try to draw or write your fantasies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to change is really hard. But     it's worth it  
"
"I'm very emotional too, always have been. I think the world is a better place for people who are emotional, who can really feel and relate to others. But it can make our lives difficult.

If it is interfering with your life then you may want to seek help for it. But let's be clear about one thing: what your boss did was totally unacceptable and unprofessional. It's a form of abuse. I don't know ANYONE who wouldn't be upset about something like that! So if you were predisposed to tears, sure they would come out there. I might not have cried, but I'd have been devastated nonetheless.

I don't know what your work situation is, or what your company is like, but if you have an HR department you can talk to in confidence, you may want to consider doing so. 

You have healthcare options, which is great. If you already have a counsellor, then ask him or her for help. 

Ask if dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) might be a good option. It's a combination of CBT and mindfulness practice (that's an oversimplification) that may help you learn new tools for how to react when bad things happen like that presentation. It took a while but it has helped me a lot."
"If you're under the care of someone and know when it's time to head back for a booster session in therapy, then I don't see any reason why you and your partner can't have kids. If you're putting in the work on yourselves to make sure you're healthy (or at least you're managing your mental health), and you're able to watch out for signs of developing disorders in your children, you're doing everything you can to set them up for success. You deserve to have a family as much as anyone else. 

Mental illness runs rampant in my family, but I'm not going to let that stop me and my therapists agree. I plan to have my kids accompany me to family therapy when they're old enough every now and then for a ""check up,"" to set the example by allowing open discussion of mental health and feelings as is appropriate for their age, teaching healthy coping skills and boundaries, admitting I'm wrong when I'm wrong, and to let them know that if they want to see someone and talk to someone outside of the family, I'm happy to set that up. 

Maybe check out this vid on [Parenting with Mental Illness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1n_brM-vbI) by therapist Kati Morton."
"Man, that's rough my dude. No one can really ""Fix"" you but you, but there are some avenues that you could explore. First thing would be to try and contact your Father, and just lay it all out there to him. There's a good chance if your Mom is living the tweaker lifestyle that there is something more going on there, she could very easily be standing between you two for her own selfish reasons. Bypass your mother and see if your Dad can help at all - even if it's just to listen. Calling isn't even necessary here if you don't want to, drive or ride and see him in person. You may be surprised at the result. 

Another suggestion that may be controversial: see about talking to someone at your local church. You may not be capable of faith right now, but basically any reputable church has officials that deal with this kind of stuff regularly. If you don't have easy access to a therapist, you probably have some access to a priest/bishop/deacon/etc.. At the very least they're good at listening, and they've heard a lot before - your story isn't likely to scare them off, and they will also have access to resources that you don't. The denomination shouldn't really matter, so long as it's not a fringe group like faith healers or the like. Go where your heart takes you, even if you're scoffing the whole way. 

If you find yourself staring down a noose, gun, bottle of pills or whatever else - stop, pack a bag, and just start walking. Don't go back. Those who care will understand eventually, those who don't don't matter. 

Ideally, you need to be out of your current situation and talking to someone. In any event, feel free to contact me if you ever feel the need. "
2 possibilities. They may ask a lot of questions. Answer them honestly. If they let you lead - literally say everything you just wrote out.
Anti-depressants have helped me get out of three ruts throughout my life. Took them for like 2-4 months and was my regular self afterwards.
"Bruh I’m so glad you made it. Even though I know literally nothing about you, you make the world a brighter place just by you being here. "
Did your friend get tired of your illness? Maybe they turned out to be fake? I've had friends show their true colors when hard times came up
Don't worry yourself too much. Those symptoms are familiar to me. I have (had?) anxiety and was treated successfully. Go and see your doctor
I just came here to ask basically the same thing. Idk what advice to give but you're not the only one. Hopefully we both get some answers :)
"I'm just terribly scared if I end up acting on my thoughts, that's also one of my obsessions. Thank you by the way, I'm sure this will help."
Im gonna echo what others have said. You're not helping the situation in one way or another which i can easily infer from your screen name.
It could honestly be any disorder from the schizo-family. They all have auditory hallucinations and can be mistaken for depression at first.
I’m glad they helped you. It’s nice to see it works for some people. Hope everything keeps going alright for you. Good luck ����
"I’m so glad it’s helped. I’m going through a very difficult, stressful time myself and I’m thinking about posting about it on here. "
Me. Private message me anytime. I am an oddball though...I definitely belong here. I can listen to you though and help you through stuff. :)

"Thank you so much. I’ll be back in this thread soon I’m sure, and hopefully everyone will come back and help me some more. Thank you all"
That sounds like a very clear indicator of a relapse into thought disorder and psychosis. Definitely do what you can to send help their way.
"Trite garbage, the lot of them.  Not an angstrom of insight to be found in this tripe.

When my girlfriend left I started to get this inexplicable type of deja vu feeling that sounds just like this. I've yet to find a solution.
Yeah but most hospitals have a mental health ward where people get hospitalized for mental health issues. That's what I meant by psych ward.

"keep writing, OP. At least you can offload some of your feelings on here.

Is it anything specific that  makes you feel stressed or fearful?"
most of the time when i get invited or make plans with someone i flake at the last minute. Partly due to anxiety and partly due to lazyness.
"EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH. My friend says I should get diagnosed based on the things above. I say I don't, that I'm not autistic and, even if I was, I don't want to be diagnosed because all it'll do is hurt me, not help me.

I'm just curious as to your thoughts on whether I should or not/if I seem like I am and, therefore, for some reason, should be diagnosed.

Thank you for your opinion."
"Hes vulnerable and hurting. He's emotional and not thinking. Simply set the conditions you want if he wants to see you.  Tell him, he wants to meet you, he must first call or text permission.  Set parameters and stick to them. Don't ignore him, if he was a friend...but be clear with him and if he breaches your boundaries, withdraw your attention and tell him when u are going to do that and why"
"I do agree. But, also, sometimes your mindset changes and along with that you need to adopt a different kind of medication. I was taking fluoxetine for a while, but that med sort of wore off as my depression turned more into extreme anxiety, and my doctor prescribed Zoloft.

I would definitely check with your doctor to see if a change in dosage or a switch is needed. Hope I could help! �� "
"I went to rehab in Cali back in November and December of last year. I’ll never forget what a very close C/A once said to me after I confessed to former toxic patterns in relationships.

None of this is easy and admitting you’re going through a difficult time and that you want to get help is true bravery. "
"I'm much past quarter ... I am actually more than half-way (I am 47)...but I can relate. It feels like now that I am older, everything that I had been burying for 25+ years is coming up to the surface.

"I’m fine with making new friends, but very afraid of romantic relationships. You sound traumatised. Not many people understand or have much empathy for people who have been through really bad breakups. Not all breakups are the same. All I can suggest is to begin with making new friends and only trusting them very slowly over time - a good friendship can be a very healing thing. Best wishes x"
"Perfectly natural to feel that way. I do too. I write, sing, play in a shitty band. Nonetheless I do it because it makes me happy. Its my only creative outlet. So I write, play and sing all the time in my free time. My suggestion, do your craft all the more and enjoy the experience!! Its yours and yours alone. Thats beautiful to me. It's why I love being an artist in a different form as well. "
Thank you! I relate so much to your story. I’m 20 and hospitalizations and IOP groups have been my life for years. It feels so impossible it’s like your brain wants you to believe you can’t do it. It took a point where I knew I was ready to jump back into the world and fortunately enough I’m in a position where I could wait a little to get back on my feet. Wishing you the best of luck!
"That is a really inappropriate leap to make and potentially quite damaging. Please reconsider your liberal application of labels... Your comments on here generally speak to a lack of education on the subject but sound as if you're coming from a place of authority.

"That’s why you need to call and ask.  That would be a question to ask of the provider to whom you were referred.

"You don't need to be nervous, but if it helps you can write everything down. He's a doctor and has definitely seen stranger things than somebody being nervous. But let him or a psychiatrist decide the right medication for you. Their knowledge goes beyond what you can research on the web.

No i lie a lot to get what i want, it helps me get what i want sometimes.

"It's the old familiar version of you that is feeling sad and attempting to grab your focus by force of habit. I'm so happy for you. You're going to love New York. Trust in that voice within you that can't help but be excited. Follow that voice and who knows, maybe less and less over time that old you jumps in. What else are the options? Keep doing the things you've tried over the years that only sort of worked to help you gain balance? Or give into a revolutionary new adventure? The universe has got your back! Its going to be awesome. Good luck! Just get there and give it some time. Sounds like its probably going to be truly  amazing! Congtats!"
"Coffee has almost no caloric content and has some effect on blood sugar, namely, it helps lower it. Eating nothing but coffee is sure to bring your blood sugar dangerously low which can have lots of weird effects. I have hypoglycemia, so I’m pretty familiar myself with what I know is low blood sugar. When my blood sugar crashes, I feel separated from my body for a bit until I pass out, and everything goes white. One thing I would recommend for stability, and to help scientifically rule out any confounding variables, make sure you keep to a schedule and keep track of what you’re eating. It’s helped me out of quite a bit. Find your groove and stick to it.

I can’t really speak to video games causing detachment. I wouldn’t think of that as a cause of this issue, and more as a symptom of something else. What drove you to play this game longer than you normally would? Something to think on."
"Hi there, thanks so much for sharing, you're very brave. I've experienced this too. My dad died when I was 9 and I experienced Post traumatic stress. It only triggers when I'm overwhelmed and I become disassociated. It feels like my psychical body and inner concussions are drifting apart. I'm talking to people and I look like I'm functioning but I have this feeling like I'm dreaming.  You're experiencing disassociation.  It's defined as: ""... any of a wide array of experiences from mild detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from physical and emotional experiences.""

&amp;#x200B;

What helped me was reminding myself what was real. Sometimes I'd reach and touch sometime and keep saying positive things to myself like 'It's going to be ok'. Anything that you do to self soothe will help too, maybe take a bath or just do something nice for yourself.  Everything will be ok x "
"I don't want to sound mean, but maybe he is not the person for you. Believe me, he sounds like an insensitive jerk, to be honest. The one thing you DO NOT EVER say to a person with mental health issues is ""get over it"" or ""just don't think that way"". If it were THAT easy, we wouldn't be suffering like we do! If he can't support you in your time of need then you don't need someone like that. I know it isn't easy walking away from someone you love, but if staying with him is going to cost you your mental health (not to mention possibly make you worse as you try to ""be normal"" for him when you should be able to be YOURSELF), then you need to step away. Now. It will only get worse and you will fall off that proverbial cliff and literally lose everything: him, your sanity, possibly your health.

Good luck and if you need to talk, I am here. Believe me, I know exactly what you are going through. &lt;3"
There is always going to be things we don’t understand or agree with in life. It sounds like you are incredibly frustrated. The only person being negatively affected by the anger is yourself so it is in your own best interest to try and let it go even if you think the law is ridiculous. Laws aren’t usually pulled from nowhere and there is usually a lot of information used in their development which we are not aware of. Obviously they are never going to be perfect or ideal for every single situation but someone has to make that call. If you are so passionate about the incorrectness of certain laws you could gather as much as evidence as possible to question their validity and attempt to get them reviewed or aim to get in a position or profession  where you have more of a say. If you can’t let it go on your own I would definitely get some help because it is not much fun feeling like you do.
"Congrats on taking that step! As cheesy as it sounds, that is half the battle. 

I’m in the US, so I’m not sure how the NHS system works, but if you can, be picky! Finding the right therapist that clicks with you is the main challenge. 

When you’re there, lay out your thoughts and what’s bugging you. It might be helpful to take a list, but don’t rely too much on it. In my experience, therapy is an in the moment thing. 

Most therapists want to work on the present you, not the past you. They will likely ask about your childhood and family and whatnot, but unless there is something affecting you in your current life that relates to back then, they likely won’t press on it. 

Therapists are there to help guide you, not direct. You will be the one making the revelations and decisions, not your therapist. They may make suggestions or hint, but the main thing they do is help you sort and make sense of your thoughts while helping you realize what is rational and what isn’t. They will also give you tools to use outside of therapy to help you do the above things. 

Therapy helped me a lot through some low times, but it also helps me when I’m just “fine.” It is something you have to make a commitment to though. It is not a magic solution (that unfortunately does not exist), but a long term process that takes effort. If you stick to it though, it will pay off. 

I wish you the best &lt;3"
"1. are you upset that he's being so forward about his desire for other women?
2. or are you upset that he doesn't think about what you're saying and answer appropriately?
   1. Follow up to this one, does this happen in other types of convo, excluding other women?

I have no problem accepting the fact that someone you date probably finds other people attractive. You probably find loads of other people attractive. We're not dead just because we're in a relationship. I do tend to find it problematic when someone starts disregarding how what they're saying affects you and what it implies in their desire to be with you or their desire for you. I also may be in a minority or something,  or maybe it's just a female or male difference... I do find other people aesthetically attractive but I don't have any big interest in having sex with them over sex with my SO, just because of that. I might be wrong, but I felt like if you were really into someone that would be kind of a natural thing. Establish your boundary because clearly, you feel disrespected. If it's taking a toll on your self esteem then maybe reconsider the relationship. Or maybe just feel less inclined to be quiet about your desires. You're not the only person in your relationship with eyes... 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the other possibility, you should look up what attentive listening is and ask your husband if he'd be willing to learn more about it. Being attentive at listening is sometimes a natural skill, but you can learn how to be more of an attentive listener if you care enough to. And if he doesn't care enough to, then idk. Not a relationship worth staying in for the rest of your life, imo. "

"Have you ever extensively talked to a mental health professional about your problems?  

Like therapy or multiple sessions with the same one?"
Heeeell no. At one point i was seeing 3 people just to figure out who might work for like 2 weeks.  Finally found a great one. It takes time.
"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

You're still the same person really.. and we are all really similar tbh I think you'll figure yourself out in a good way."
I do but i really don't wanna go to a doctor when i really don't have anything. That's why i wanted to ask if it's worth even worrying about.
"I hate that we have to do this.  I used to refuse to, but I figured people saw this as being rude, so now I do it.  It means nothing, though."
"I have a job. I just live paycheck to paycheck, and don't ever have the chance to save money because i always end up paying to fix the house."
I put down my electronics 1 hour before bed and just read. It takes me out of my mind and helps me relax. It’s the best thing for my sleep.
"I worry sometimes that if I say it out loud, that’ll make it true. But skirting around the issue never makes it any better. It’s a limbo."
I'd say it's pretty normal. Especially if you're just coming back from taking time off. Dealing with this kinda stuff can be very exhausting.
I'm glad that you're taking the proper steps toward recovery. Just make sure that you continue to do what's necessary in order to get better.
"It can happen all throughout the day. Moreso at night, probably due to exhaustion. But it can happen anytime. Thank you for your input ❤️"

Sorry...my stupid internet is out and I have to use my phone which is awkward. I am glad you'd had such a nice meal. How are you doing today?
Strength training and yoga. Both have the tense/release rhythm I like. Can't do cardio but a lot of people in my treatment center do running.
"Thank you so much. Yes, that’s what I’m after, some coping skills. I’m definitely looking forward to it, I hope it’s able to help me."
That's like what I do right now.. no friends and if I do have friends.. I will be a burden to them always a burden I just wanna erase myself
"This answer, OP, was a great summary to my inquiry as well. Thank you, it’s easier to understand when someone simply answers the question. "
We are in the same friend group so Im probs gonna end up going as a group with her but god I can't stand the thought of her with another guy.

You’re not an attention seeker, don’t use that as an excuse to stay quiet, if you speak up then I’m sure that you will find help."
"Hun. Depression doesn't discriminate and it isn't choosy. I had a shit childhood and all that, but I wouldn't think bad of ANYONE who said ""hey, I think I have depression"". I don't care why (I don't mean I don't care WHY...just I don't care if you're rich, poor, educated, uneducated, black, white, alien, Klingon...you get the picture)...I just care you are here and talking about it. Welcome. :)"
"I'm not quite sure how I'll be able to help regarding about that. I initially thought that maybe his suggestion to see a therapist and your regular Psych might be a good idea if what you said to him is something he didn't know how to solve. However, I doubt I know anything about the whole context of it all.

I hope you're doing fine there. This is the best I could do for you. ������"
I’m so glad I’m not the only one. I barely remember my childhood. And I have an aversion towards learning about it. I’ve been told the typical embarrassing parent stories. But most of what I remember is scattered and unpleasant. Mostly my parents fighting with one another. I’ve never been to therapy but probably need it. I hope you’re journey is going well and that you are okay *hugs*
"One thing I’ve noticed with my anxiety and depression is I’ve been living with both for so long, I don’t even know what is “not normal” for me anymore; it’s become a part of who I am now almost. So yes I understand. But sometimes I will catch myself thinking or doing something and realize “hey, this isn’t normal” and that’s when I write those things down. You’re not alone!"
"This is the perfect place for this. I am sorry you're going through such a crap time right now. I don't really have any advice beyond the obvious (go talk to someone) because it sounds like a little bit of depression is setting in, and possibly other issues. I can't diagnose you, but that is what I see. You really need to talk these things out so you can begin to heal. I wish you luck and love."
"Yeah but it also doesn't hurt just to talk to them. You just have to be honest about how you feel. And there is also such a thing as medication for social anxiety too. If that's what you're struggling with.

I would also recommend group therapy. It'll force you to be around other people and it'll help you relax in social situations. Just tell them what you've told us on here and you'll be fine."

"Hi. Licensed Mental Health Counselor here.

I would think it's rare to meet someone who is cycling through episodes of binging and purging but not struggling with bulimia.

But if we're being technical, eating disorders tend to be characterized by a preoccupation with weight or body image, a pattern of compensatory behaviors (fasting, purging, excessive exercise, laxatives), and feelings of guilt and shame associated with body image and/or the compensatory behavior. I would think any one or mixture of these would be a sign that an eating disorder is present or that the person is vulnerable to an eating disorder being present.

Hope that helps!

"I just wanted to leave something here because (at least in my case) just a comment can make me feel slightly better for the acknowledgment alone. To be honest, from what you said, seems like you're at least trying to make an effort, doing push-ups and walking your dog and even playing games often is a lot harder to do than it seems. I think you're on the right path, given that, try focusing on your dreams even if it's 5 minutes per day, I don't know for sure what they are but if you really enjoy it it shouldn't be that bad. Either way, again, just wanted to say something instead of just scrolling by. Hope you get to do what you wanna do, mate c:"
"It is good that he is seeing a therapist. It will take time to uncover why he is going through this kind of emotional turmoil. From my own experiences, it sounds like he may have some attachment/ abandonment issues with his father (which would explain why he feels this way now) but I am not a doctor so take that with a grain of salt. 
You might consider talking to someone as well, because you need emotional support right now as a mother and caregiver. As someone else stated above, a social worker can assist you with this.
I am so sorry you are going through this, if you need to talk you can PM me, maybe we can find a local program that can help."
"Yeah not trying to be the person like ""Vitamins will make your problems go away!"" but one of the first things my psychiatrist did when I started seeing her was she told me to take a vitamin B complex (it's like a big pill that has a bunch of different B vitamins in it) and vitamin D, and she also recommended a multivitamin. And it really did help, it didn't fix anything necessarily, but it made just the little bit of a difference that I needed so that I could help myself get better. A balanced diet and plenty of water intake helps also - certainly won't cure anything, but you'll physically feel better and more capable of taking care of yourself."
"the rules may be diff in canada, but first and foremost, don’t pay for some website to send you a “certificate” to prove that a dog is an ESA...they’re scams. I think that all you need for an ESA is written documentation from a mental health clinician stating that having the dog benefits you or prevents harm in some way. however, unless you plan on traveling on a plane or living in an apartment that otherwise has a no-pet policy, there isn’t really any point in making the dog an ESA because they don’t have public access rights anyway. again, all of my info is US-relevant but i’d imagine the policies in canada are somewhat similar. "
"I think this same thing happens to me. It's not a random voice, it's just me talking, but it's as though it bypasses my consciousness and goes straight to being vocalised. It usually happens under stress. If I'm running I'll sometimes say ""you can do this"" or if I'm depressed I say ""I want to die"" or ""kill me"" a lot more than I would like.

If an uncomfortable memory enters my brain I'll frequently just say ""no!"" or I'll swear at myself or another person I'm thinking of.

I have no idea what deeper meaning there is to all this but I have been mostly lucky enough so far that I at least usually only do it when I'm alone. If it happens when I'm not alone then quick thinking usually helps me out and I can cover it up, but I do sometimes worry about it getting worse when I'm around others.

Sorry I can't give any insight but, if this seems to match your experiences, at least you know you're not alone!"
"IT still stands...you don't need to paint him in any light. You told the truth about what he is ""doing"" to you, and that isn't right. 

How do I know?

I live with a husband who does NOT support me in the least when it comes to my numerous mental illnesses and problems. He wants me to just ""act normal for fuck's sake"" and says ""you are too screwed up..."" when we fight. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Self-Harming behaviors as well as being a recovering Alcoholic (2 years sober!) and now, the latest diagnosis: Pyromania. This came out of nowhere because of a trigger. I didn't even know it was a problem until it was.

Please take my words and think about them. I am not saying you HAVE to leave him (I can't say that anyhow, I would be a hypocrite) but he needs to change his attitude now so you can relax and heal. Love to you! &lt;3 Stay well, my friend."
"If you are unattractive, do not have anything to offer a woman, and then live your life in a way that would scare not only women but also men....YES, you sir would be an incel. If you are simply unattractive and are rich with confidence or money, you'll find women who will want you. The fact that you come here to Reddit and call yourself ""Repulsive"" kinda proves you may in fact just be scaring all women away, not just for sex.....but for friendships. I knew guys who were ugly, yet they pulled more women than I could ever because they had a personality that I could never attain, let alone display. To be rejected would mean you would have to make an attempt...and by the sound of it...you don't seem like you would approach a roach....with how low your self-esteem is.

""If I am then death is not. If death is, them Im not"" ~ Epikur

You are human. You are blessed and simultaneously cursed with abstract thinking. Remember that our thinking is a tool to solve problems, it's not you! Its important to understand that. You can think or visualize pink elephant, does it mean it actually  exist? Your anxiety about death is from abstract thinking and high intelligence. You are thinking about it because your neocortex forces you to do this. When we don't have an answer (e.g. what is afterlife), abstract thinking goes ""louder"". Especially when you are fully aware that that one day you will be dead. Your ""thinking"" is really worried about it because it has no answer and it's afraid that can be gone too.  There might be something completely different after death that is not connected with thoughts and might be something based on completely different rules that we already know like life based on carbon. It might be so different that you cannot wrap your head around it. Like your brain is limited to answer this because there is no death when you are...

"All the lovely people here have already said even more than I could possibly hope to say. This isn’t your fault, pm me if you want to talk. "
And I really didn’t mean any of that to come off as rude. I really am having a bad time. So apologies if it wasn’t a thoughtful response.
"Can you visit a different psychiatrist? Do you have a diagnosis in mind that you think applies to you? (Not recommending this, just curious). "
Cheers to you too! Hope you can find something that works. I had gone to a psychologist to do mine. I forgot to add that. :) Have a great day!
Do they have a [partner like CAHOOTS](https://kval.com/news/local/theres-a-growing-awareness-that-alternatives-to-law-enforcement-are-needed)?
"Hang in there. Remember this will get better, eventually. All you can do is the best you can with what is right in front of you in the moment."
"I feel for you, I'm in the same boat, and I'm really not ok either. If you need someone in a similar situation to talk to feel free to pm me.
"
I gathered that. My point is that most likely the responses you receive will be so varied as to not provide you with a consistent experience.
"I promise that you wouldn’t be a burden, the offer always stands. Hope you feel a bit better over the next few days, I know it’s hard :/ x"
"I'm in this exact boat right now. 
I've promised myself I'll take those time to find a job that pays better from where I currently am though. "
"If it is any consolation, many of here have been in exactly your shoes and made it out alive. Stay strong and don't be afraid to ask for help."
It takes so much energy to do all of that everyday and many days there isn't nearly enough energy to go around seems I'm always at a deficit.
It’s just a buzzword for western style meditation basically. “Grounding” exvercises are really helpful when I’m in panic mode though.
"Please see a therapist if you aren't already. Could be delusions or psychosis, maybe something like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder."
"Sometimes you gotta just do it. If you can get a job, do so and secretly save money to move out. Keep it in the bank so they can’t steal it."
"Thank you for responding. I had considered this but, the thing is, I don't feel depressed or sad. I don't know what it is or what I'd even say"
"Thank you so much for listing a few techniques, I'll try and implement those next time I feel an episode coming on. I really appreciate this! "
"Thanks for that correction.  I was on Citalopram so long ago before Lexapro had a generic, so I should have known that, but alas, I did not.  "
"Thanks. I tell my therapist everything and she hasn't mentioned the possibility of OCD, I'll look into it and bring it up at my next session. "
That's mostly what I'm worried about. I don't want this little brat walking into our house treating us like crap and just putting up with it.
This definitely helps. I appreciate you taking the time to respond and your advice. Thank you very much. I will look into what you suggested.

That being said, this break you’re taking - do something to enrich yourself or you’ll be pulled into the slump forever- that’s my personal feeling about it.

"Have you considered that he may be exaggerating or just flat out making things up to get you guys to come get him? His brain is sick and needs help, so this might be very likely.

"It's definitely possible she might have tried spice/K2 (synthetic weed) with a really bad response. It's also possible, as others have said, that it could be bipolar with psychotic features. I would encourage calling a crisis hotline if you have one in your area. They might be able to send someone over to help evaluate what it might be. Around me, the number is 211 from any phone, just like 911."
"Same. My dreams are very vivid and realistic. I wouldn't say I could lucid dream, but it definitely messes with you when you wake up and get that state of brain lag and confusion on whether things actually happened or not.

Medicine to help sleeping might help. It doesn't for me, but I'm still working on getting a good dose to knock me out instead of letting my thoughts run right before I sleep."
"This is something you'll just have to overcome on your own. I understand why you don't trust therapists but you need to realize that they're there to help you. It's their job to listen to your problems and offer advice. Don't worry about your mom right now. And if you really don't trust them, you can always send me a message to get this stuff off your chest. However, that's completely up to you."
Will send good thoughts your way man. Never give up on yourself! I’ve come close a few times but don’t do it! Because if you don’t believe in yourself no one else will! It will be ok I promise! Just be proactive and keep the faith and figure out what your goals are and take things day by day to achieve them! And always seek resources and help if you think you need it be your own advocate!
Your psychologist should be able to perform a full psych evaluation. See a psychiatrist if they are not available right away see an apnp (advanced nurse practitioner) no idea on wait times. Mental health is being taken way more serious now I have to wait 2 months to see a psychiatrist. But get in as soon as possible and ask for a full psych evaluation. Don’t hesitate or things could get worse.
"I appreciate you going back and forth with me on this, thanks! 

So even though it might be anonymous between me and coworker, we’re still coworkers. And unless it’s a really large company, chances are we might figure out who is who. With many options where I know there’s a 99.9% I’m not talking to a coworker, I would pick that over what you are offering. 

The reason I brought up suicidal thoughts is because in any health care service I’ve ever used, I’m told that my information is confidential UNLESS I am a threat to myself or others. So in your peer service you’d need a clear explanation of what would happen in those situations. "
"I have high functioning anxiety. I think most people think I am stuck up, but really, I just have enough social anxiety to keep me away from people, but be friendly when I absolutely need to. I have had panic attacks in the past, but not that many at all. My depression was the opposite - absolutely debilitating and effecting every part of my life. But my anxiety different.

I actually did not have a word for this until I was on YouTube and came across this TedTalk:

I related to this video so completely. It was nice to here I was not the only person in some limbo."
"Thank you so much for your reply !  No, this issue only comes up in romantic relationships for me. I definitely think the wrong person is a factor, it’s as if their ways of handling the relationship are the exact triggers for certain traumas in my past. So I’ve learned that this doesn’t mean they are a terrible person, just that their relationship style doesn’t work well with mine. I also absolutely agree that on some level I need to start feeling comfortable alone, and need to explore that. I think I have fears of being alone that are irrational. Thank you so much for your input and reminding me I am not broken, I really appreciate it ! "
"well done! lovely post to read, i see so many posts of people who are lost and don’t know how to heal, they should read this post. i used to be in the same place as you, every day i wanted to die, but over the last couple years i actually enjoy life and it was the baby steps and the cliche advice that slowly lead me to heal, now i feel “safe” so to speak, i still have bad days where i feel low and contemplate suicide but it goes away rather quickly, self love is the key i think. but i’m proud of you for getting to the point you are at, it is inspirational and people need to know that they can feel better, carry on posting the progress! :)"
"I could be wrong and please don’t take this the wrong way, but she probably thinks you’re being “too clingy” despite all the talking you guys have already done. Young girls in my own experiences like to pretend that they are too cool for people that actually like them and thus label them “clingy”. The good morning text shouldn’t be taken as being clingy, especially when a lot of girls say that would make them swoon. 

I hope I am not coming off as someone who hates women, but I’ve been in your situation so many times and I know it hurts like a mf. Stay strong and try not to contact her for a while, if she doesn’t text or anything then she was just too immature to tell you she lost interest or whatever the excuse.

Don’t beat yourself up over it, consider the fact that if the worst is the truth then you dodged a bullet by keeping someone so shitty out of your life. Best of luck."
"That i *do not* have a choice and i do not blow things out of proportion.  

At some point i just stopped trying to explain things, it is like describing colors to a blind person.  

""Just do something, look i got this thing here to keep you busy, you can do that!""  

At that point i could not do anything, everything got me angry, annoyed and frustrated.  
I could not push through it, everything was torture at that point.  
Playing video games? Nope, 5 minutes i was done, angry and annoyed.   
Going for a walk? Just the thought of going outside made me have a anxiety attack.  
Masturbating? Not even that was fun anymore, i just cried half way through.  

But they come along and say ""Just do this, then you feel better!""  

No, something is wrong in my head, i can not just choose.  
I did not get here because i stopped doing things, i stopped doing things because i simply could not do them anymore.

"If you really want to try to gain traction see the list of subreddits on the side of this page. On many of those subs you should ask the mods there if you can make a post about your sub. I would try both the bipolar subreddits, the schizophrenia subreddit, the OCD subreddit, the anxiety subreddit. All of them if you can. 

Submit to r/yoursub and submit to r/newreddit. This will help promote your sub ever slightly enough. If you need help designing your sub you can get a moderator to help you with that or you can try your hand at it with help from r/csshelp. Although you should create another sub and make it private so that you can test your CSS  in it before putting it on to your sub. Try to get the front page of your sub filled out so that it's not barren. Maybe sticky that post you have that says ""*Help get this thing started? Post something :)*"".

"I've been feeling the same way, thinking the same things more frequently these days. I try to combat it by essentially answering my own questions. Trying to look for a silver lining. and some solutions.

My biggest fear is dying suddenly, without getting to say goodbye
 to combat that, I'm.working on a Google docs slideshow , of essentially a will, or my life story. It shares links to my personal blog posts and stuff as well. my friend has it, and if I die, it's to be shown to all my.loved ones.

You can't stop death, but you don't have to be famous to leave something behind... Besides, in a few thousand years, our planet will cease to exist. No matter who you are i ln this life, everyone here will all meet the same fate. But don't see that as a sad thing! Leave an impact on the world while you're here...even a small one, even if you only.impact those in your immediate circle.

As for what happens when we lose consciousness? I'm scared of that, very much so. Sometimes I think of religions, but I'm not dedicated enough to follow one...still, having one might soothe my thoughts. I think that's why religion was invented in the first place, really...to try and keep people from worrying about this.

I think when we die, we just go to sleep. You don't remember anything when you sleep, right? In reality, I think that's what it is ..sadly. I'm starting to cry now, just writing this :( The thought of reincarnation makes me smile, sort of. Or perhaps when we die, we can dream and dream forever, just as if were sleeping forever. that's unlikely, but I could hope so.

It's sad. I don't want to die Young. if I live enough to be an old bag, I will be happy. I want to see flying cars.

But yeah, sorry  now i went off topic. but this bothers me a lot to.

Make a will, a video diary, something...that way even if you do not become important, like a president or something...you leave this behind, a story to tell. do it."
"A new attitude towards suicide - actual prevention, not just ""Oh gee, how horrible, let's move on. The world is perfect. Suicidals are idiots""."
"Be careful! Don't let this ruin your life. If I was you, I'd run as far away from acid as possible. Good luck and please take care of yourself."
"Don't start smoking, it'll just add to your stress and anxiety in the long run. It's such a shitty habit and definitely lowers quality of life."
Have you considered transhumanism? I think it looks at using science and technology as a solution to mortality. Might be kind of sci-fi though.
"Hmmm. Might be (I can't say for sure over the Internet) anxiety. Can you see a therapist at all? This might be worth exploring...

How long have you been off marijuana? I’ve read studies that suggest the effects of marijuana abuse are only short term (a few years at most)
I am currently 17 and get the same thing but i take it out on myself to protect those close to me. Do you think i should go get it checked out?
I appreciate that mate and am excited to get started. Lucky for me it's time for me to stock up. Now I have a base of what to go after. Thanks!
I was going to suggest Mandalas and walking as well! Also I like to listen to podcast while I am coloring my Mandalas to get me out of my head!
I would request a change. If I wanted to talk to someone they should at least be 45 and have life experience. A 24 year old is basically a kid.
"I'll consider it, thank you! Though, I'm not sure if they'll attempt to put me into therapy or just transfer me into a different school /shrug "
"I'm really glad to hear it helped. My situation is different but similar. If you ever need anybody to chat with or vent to, just shoot me a pm."
In a heartbeat. I have PTSD from torture and nearly dying.  I'd give it all up and the memories of what happened if I could. I miss who I was.
It's running wild today. I did something that could have been very bad...I just can't stop myself. I think I need to talk to a Therapist. Soon.
Jess Christ!! Report this guy please!! That is a disgusting abuse of power and he should be forced to face consequences! I'm actually sickened
"No my health is actually something i put a decent amount of work into, i used to play a lot of sport and I'm very dedicated to getting stronger"
Oh wow. This sounds terrifying. Sounds like your brain got its wires crossed or something. :( I am sorry this happened. Do you feel better now?
Right there with you. I wrote out my thoughts and sealed them in an envelope and it at least got me out of my anxiety attack. Maybe it can help
"She will be so angry about it, but ok!! I will try to do it. They dont have any access to any of my money thankfully! Thank you for your words!"
"Thanks for replying! Yeh it makes me anxious I guess, haha. Yeah maybe I'll go back to my therapist and actually open up this time. Thankyou :)"
"The age of consent to mental health treatment varies from state to state. I’m not sure what it is in Louisiana, but in some states it is 16. "
There are nice guys out there! You just happened to sleep with a jerk! And no you probably did nothing wrong. This guy just sounds like a dick.
This is exactly how I feel most of the time but at least you felt a bit better today. It's hard to do something about it or pretend to be happy
"Well it’s time for him to take the high road himself.

But in any case, hearing stuff like that wouldn’t exactly put me in the mood anyway."
What about murderers who are widely hated and are a burden to the state? Would you advise against suicide for Anders Brevik or John Wayne Gacy?
"What would you have me write?

I am sorry, but I am not going to read this post. Not because of laziness, but because it is not on point, dear."
"Yes, I agree with exercise. I slip back into dark spots when I don’t exercise. It can be just a short exercise too. Even a little bit helps. "
Your balance is maintained by fluid in the inner ear. Unless you damaged the brain areas responsible for processing that information unlikely.
"You’re not a creep but maybe just try to understand that not everyone will reply within seconds. People have jobs, families, their own life. "
i personally never expirience emotions ALMOST at all for like a year now. why does it bother you though? i personally think ots better this way
"Are you serious? Why ""not all there"" and not ""could my daughter have a mental illness"" or something along the lines? Personally, if I overheard my mother saying that I'm ""not all there""(in other words crazy) I would be p personally offended tbh.

And don't judge you? I have parents who reacted the same way towards my disorder. Extremely hurtful and invalidating tbh. I just feel for your daughter."
"Despite being free from chronic illness due to medicine, when it comes to mental health I have very little faith in the system. I’ve been diagnosed with nearly everything in my life - when in reality I only have PTSD �� but being diagnosed with anything at all means most doctors discredit and dismiss me. I love to talk to others, no matter the age. Hearing various experiences really helps. "
"For me it’s not looking at the end because in someways, personally the end is a cynical hope.  Having a mental health illness taught me to just try to see the good, even on your worst days. That darkness can consume and crush us if we let it, but knowing there’s communities, advocates, and everything else in between telling us that we deserve to be here makes it maybe for me a smidge easier. "
"I am a YouTuber (a gamer) and I swear sometimes when you watch some of the videos of the ""emotional"" games I have done, you can see my mental illness very clearly. Most times, you could never guess that I have 3 main illnesses right now, and a couple issues that are in my past. I am so sorry you are not doing well. Let me know if I can do anything ok? I am available for chat anytime. Love to you."
"I am no expert, but this sounds like one of a thousand variants on a theme: a need for connection or validation. If someone likes something you suggested, then you feel good about yourself. You get a small ""high"" from it and want it again. It's an attachment, a mini-addiction of sorts, if that makes any sense.

I'd try thinking more about this and why you think this is so important for you to do."
"I do this. My psychologist calls it passively suicidal. Keep in check with who and what keeps you living. But, as mentioned above have a crisis plan. I went to emergency when I was in crisis and was fast tracked to help. It's good to recognise your patterns, so you can figure out how to talk yourself down. 

You do have a lot to live for. I'm 27 now and 18 feels like a lifetime ago. Keep going :)"
"I have cuts on my arm right now, fresh and still hurting. People self-harm for a lot of reasons, and I don't know that you can do anything but make sure she knows you are there for her if she needs you. She needs to work out her problems with the professional and find out why she is self-harming. Just be a friend to her and let her know you care.   


Take it from someone who knows the feeling..."
"I really, really like using the ""how's your day going?"" approach, rather than ""how are you?"" I'm gonna start using that! Thank you. ;-)

But yeah, when people genuinely show they care, it gets me right in the feels too. I'm by nature a very emotional person. I've had to learn to scale it back in order for maintaining better composure. But sometimes things like that happen and I well up. I get it."
"I was taking Prozac and buspirone for about three years when I stopped without telling my doctor. That was irresponsible of me and my mood was awful and the withdrawal was horrible but I eventually became stable with lots of therapy and yoga. As I said, that was just my experience and that was the only way I lost the weight I gained from drugs. I understand that some people need them to function."
"I will answer this honestly. Some days...I don't. Some days I am a hot mess...not sure where I am going or what I am doing. I have a horrid past, but my kids keep me going, even through all the muck and the mud and the tears and the anger at myself. They are truly my life. My family means everything. Just find that ONE thing to hold onto and hold on like your life depends on it. Good luck to you."
"I've felt the same way for years. I've pushed away everybody that I've ever loved. And I struggle with abandonment issues.

I too believe that everybody is out to get me. And because of that I never leave the house. I spend most of my time in my bedroom. I can tell you right now that if you don't go see a doctor, things will only get worse. Do this now otherwise you'll regret it later on in life."
"It’s unfortunate that your dad has that attitude. People don’t take mental illness seriously and it’s really unfortunate. 

I don’t know what country you live in, but generally teens can see a doctor and are protected by doctor/patient confidentiality. Meaning you can see your doctor and they wouldn’t be able to tell your parents. If your mom supports you o suggest asking her about it. "
"I’m not a psychologist of any kind, but this almost sounds like OCD?  Obviously fire setting is more dangerous than most OCD rituals and I’m by no means trying to say that’s what you have, but acting on a compulsion to lessen extreme anxiety is literally what OCD is.  That’s a really common mental illness and when you frame the behavior like that really doesn’t sound outrageous at all. "
"Meditation might help you with your bad thoughts of depression. You didn't mention if obsessing over specific things in your life is something you do often but if it is, perhaps try to think about why you do it. Pay attention to how you feel when you don't think about it and when you do. It's also possible the weed threw off your brain chemistry a bit and this is how your body is coping with it. "
"Tough to not blame yourself sometimes when others blame you. :)

I know they are just ignorant but it still doesn't help.

I also really struggle in general with accountability - figuring out at which point something is my responsibility and at edible m which point I can put it down to illness. It's obviously a grey area, so it's really tough sometimes, especially when your actions damage others."
"Your mental pathways are closing because thats what you are choosing to happen! You control your own mind, your own destiny.. if your dreams no longer interest you, then find something else! Make it your dream to find a dream.. go out of your comfort zone and experience different things, get rid of this perception of life and yourself that you have. Its toxic and you're creating and enabling it. "

I am on a waiting list for therapy...I can't do anything about this until I get an appointment, which might not be for a while.

"Go see a professional. I took one of those tests for Pyromania. It came back I do suffer from it. The funny thing is, I already knew this in my heart, and seeing that result just made me so heart-sick, but at the same time, it confirmed in my mind that I DO have a problem with Pyromania. I have to go see my Psych next month about this. I usually don't put much stock in those dumb tests, but the one I took was a serious one (from a psychologist) and not just one that a dumbass made up to amuse themself. I would recommend highly that you go see someone who can diagnose you properly. Then you will know. Then you can start to heal from it. There are lots of ways to manage BPD and some medications too if you need them. I wish you all the luck in the world and please don't stress. There are lots of people here who will understand your issue...and give you lots of support. Sending looooots of hugs to you!"
"Just because he dissociated, it doesn't mean he doesn't love you or your new baby. It's just his way of protecting himself. I'm willing to bet that he feels some guilt around this whole thing, and probably a whole lot of fear. that being said, if he has gotten some of his emotion back (even if he's depressed), isn't that a sign of progress and a good thing? it might be the start point for him to make his way home.

Anyways. The fact that you're able to step back and respond with LOVE instead of anger is amazing to me. I can imagine how distressing this whole thing is for you; it's hard enough being a new mum, and to lose your husband (as you know him) in the first 2 months is devastating. My fingers are crossed that he will see your patience, and understanding and love and come home to you. It will take some time, but he has some healing he needs to do. This is the one battle he has to fight alone."
"Thanks for the comment...  1. Dissociation (even diminished physical senses) 2.  Unable to think for myself/unstable identity 3. Emotional dysregulation 4. Existential dread 5.  Constant feeling of being evil 6. Compulsive Rumination 7.  Intense shame

Pre-cult I only dealt with shame, on a lesser level.  I experienced depression or anxiety before at times, but not a feeling of being overwhelmed or necessarily dysregulated.  I didn't used to doubt my reality or feel constantly confused.  

Your assessment is true, that's what I'm looking for..,.but the ambiguity feels right, too.  It's been brought up before, but sessions can take weird turns and things can get muddied....especially since they've been trying to resolve my dissociation for 6 months.  But I'm ready to jump full in, and hopefully with a destructive cult specialist.  They're surprisingly complex and scientific the way they function.   "
"Grad student in psyd program here. Last year I did a lot of neuropsych testing and these kinds of concerns came up a lot. Go to your doctor and get a referral for testing if you're worried and if it's financially feasible. I don't know your husband, I don't have the full clinical picture, etc etc. But most of the time when we'd have people come in suspecting ADHD after 30 years of doing well otherwise, or progressive dementia at such a young age, it turned out to be depression and/or anxiety. People really underestimate how much that can impair their memory and concentration.

Again, I suggest formal testing to rule out other possibilities, but also check in with him. Work stress? Recent changes? How is your marriage? If possible, also try to go easy on him and let him be wrong some times without it turning into a fight. At the end of the day it doesn't matter who suggested Thai.

I also recommend that he seeks individual psychotherapy if these problems do seem to stem from depression or anxiety. That's a burden he shouldn't shoulder in his own and it can absolutely help improve his symptoms if indeed they are a result of being depressed or anxious."
"There are different levels of care. Generally speaking in most states you have:

Inpatient

Crisis beds - considered a step down from inpatient, these are residential facilities that offer short term intensive services until the person can safely transition back to the community. Hard to get a bed sometimes. 

Residential care - either state or private. The person typically lives in a house or apartment with 1-4 other people. Staff are on site anywhere between 8-24 hours a day depending on the type of placement. There is often a waitlist for these as well. 

Since he is going through the court, they may require that he be placed in a certain level of care. 

As far as mental health services alone, he should be established with an outpatient psychiatrist right away after discharge. 

If he doesn’t have anything to do during the day, he might benefit from a PRP (psychiatric rehabilitation program aka “day program”) for structure. 

If I were you I would try to get in touch with the social worker at the hospital where he currently is to find out what kind of discharge plan is in the works. They shouldn’t just be throwing him out on the street. "
"Try not to be so hard on yourself, I know it’s all relative and you may not feel like it but let me tell you..20 is YOUNG! The people from your school who appear to have everything together (and...I’m sorry..gotten married??? 20s crazy young for marriage imo but anyway) might not be as they seem, trust me not many 20 year olds are perfectly developed/mature/content etc. However, other people your age really don’t matter, comparing yourself to other people is not a good way to look after yourself and therefore isn’t going to help you or make you more sociable or happy etc. All you can do is go from where you are, you’re on your own journey. Try and just look at your situation objectively, don’t compare yourself but also know that you’re not alone. It is what it is, you don’t need to feel embarrassed or ‘less than’ other people. Honestly I have a friend who had never dated or had sex at 20 and she got there eventually. Now we’re 30 no one cares about that stuff at all. There’s no shame in being a late bloomer with relationships. You may not have masses of experience but being free and having your own time and space to figure this out is better than being trapped in a lie or a toxic relationship. Better to have a little time to get to know and heal yourself NOW than later in life after a string of awful relationships. Take this alone time as an opportunity x 
Edit: ALSO you can still have those first time memories and magic moments but let me tell you this...my most cherished memories of dating and sex are NOT from my teen years lol. Even when people do have kisses and sex before 20..doesn’t mean they’re that good or romantic "
"Ugh I feel you. I'm constantly working on not feeling guilty.

You might check out this article on the change triangle: [https://www.hilaryjacobshendel.com/what-is-the-change-triangle-c18dd](https://www.hilaryjacobshendel.com/what-is-the-change-triangle-c18dd)

And I concur with the first comment about positive affirmations. Our brains form learned pathways in childhood (cognitive schema) that actually might have benefited us at the time but now might be of no use. For instance, you might have learned to feel anxious and guilty when you were a kid because your brain didn't want you to get in trouble and experience the emotional trauma of that. But now, since your brain had coated that pathway in extra myelin, it's really easy for the neurons to travel down it. You can change it though! And it mainly has to do with awareness. Once you start noticing it, literally try to think of something positive relating to that situation. It takes practice but the myelin will start building up on that pathway instead and it'll get easier.

I did this with the help of my therapist. I was having anxiety about my job. Specifically, I would get really anxious about whether or not someone would come into my office unannounced. My therapist traced it back to my mother. My brain would make me anxious if there was potential for her to walk in because sometimes she would walk in and it would go badly. My brain was putting me on high alert so that it could try to protect me from that potential emotional stress. But now, that anxiety is no longer serving me. There is no longer a threat. So every time I noticed the anxiety, I would then try to think of something positive (why I'm grateful for that job, why I'm excelling at that job, etc). Eventually, the anxiety went away.

I hope this doesn't sound too crazy and I hope it helps! You don't deserve to feel guilty and shameful all of the time. We're all just these flawed humans :)"
"Can confirm, lost it for the sake of losing it. Lemme tell you, realizing midway through sex that you aren't into it is an awful, awful feeling."
"Cancer scares are horrifying, but if nothing else they make us realize how precious our lives are. I would have been worried sick if I were you!"
College isnt for everyone. Part time school might be easier. Or working PT + 1 class per semester in evenings. People find ways to make it work

An 8 year old doesn’t need to be on benzos. That’s just ridiculous. I’m not sure of advice to offer other than to just keep listening to her like you have been. Take her to someone that is specialized in treating/counseling children. Sometimes it can be hard to find the right person but you just keep looking. Is she in any activities/sports? That could help get some of the “energy” out.
"I know it's hard but you have to stop believing and thinking about the thoughts. If you do these two things, they will seem like real threats more and more. This will take a lot of effort and you will probably have to get through some anxiety. What helps me is to keep reminding myself that all the intrusive thoughts are fake. I recommend coming to r/OCD. It's a great sub that has helped my a lot. "
"I was like that for a long time. I smoked predominantly weed for years. When I wasn't smoking weed, I was smoking cigarettes. And I would often drink coffee with both. I was soon draining my wallet and my soul. I kept depleting my dopamine, then forcing it to shoot up, then depleting it again. Perhaps you have an addictive personality (as many with mental health problems do). Keep an eye on that. "
I went to one of those ear doctors that not only look at the ear from the outside but also test for hearing loss and those things. Besides that like two regular doctors. None found anything applicable. Most likely explanation they have is that it is something in my brain but I am not sure who to ask to look at my brain haha. I could ask within my uni but it would have to be someone more specific.
"Rarely, sometimes doing psychadellics or enduring unforseen trauma (i.e. war/ ptsd) can bring it on faster but genetically it is inevitable.


If I were you Id call the state medical board and see how many complaints the doc has outstanding and look into the credentials.  Maybe it was misunderstood or not stated correctly, it seems very suspicious that a medical doctor would make that statement.  "
"Thanks for the kind words! 

Honestly I don't really hang out with anybody most of the time. I'm a very solitary person and I can barely remember the last time I was interested in someone in a sexual or romantic way.

"You're probably right there about OHIP, I last went as a teen to a psychologist and we didn't pay so I assumed it was OHIP.

This will come out wrong, so bare with me LOL.

"I literally just had this experience...sort of. I had been ranting and raving about my problem to my friend via messenger, and finally she told me bluntly that I am just ""bragging"" to her about what is going on...and she made it clear she was sick of hearing about my problem. That hurt like a mofo, and I am still hurt deeply because she was literally the only one I could talk to (besides ranting here)...now she wants to just keep it ""business"" (we are in a Group on FB together that helps people with games) and I don't even want to associate with her anymore because she hurt me SO badly. I feel you. :( Come here and rant anytime. You are safe here. "
"I'm sorry to hear that you had a horrible experience with this. I'm also glad to see that you're still with us :)

Therapists (even with insurance) are not accessible because our country does not prioritize mental health and does not invest in it adequately. The psych community needs to get off their high horse and embrace tech. Not everyone experiencing suicidal thoughts wants a face to face interaction and that should be respected. Better Help should also know better than to pass the buck with someone in this situation. Especially when it is well-known in the psych community that therapy is not accessible to everyone because of scarcity and cost."
"One thing I did was finally have a conversation with my brother's girlfriend. After they've been dating for 5 years now I legitimately had a conversation with her for the first time in my life, and it lasted like 30-40 minutes which I didn't think was possible for me.

 A big problem for me is that after being somewhere such as a family event or school where I'm talking/being around people, when I get home I come to nothing and I feel extremely empty, lonely, and sad. After that I spend the rest of my night listening to music and trying not to fuck myself up. I keep digging into my upper thigh with my nails and sharp objects around me impulsively. "
"Allowing or being amused by my older brother being physically abusive to me. He could do no wrong, I could do no right (which messed him up a lot too.

Having to get a job at 13 to buy my own clothes, and food, because ""I grew too fast"" mom didn't want to buy me clothes cause I would ""just grow out of them"" my mom was physically abusive till I was about 11 or 12, I'm a big dude now, 6'5"" 230lb, the psych abuse intensified when I got too big for her to feel safe physically abusing me any more.  Psych abuse took longer to get over, I think we need a good deffinition, I think a lot of kids get abused because other adults in their group don't have a good deffinition.   "
"Based on what you've said it does sound like you have some form of anxiety (not a doctor). Ive similar symptoms but different triggers. I find it's sometimes good to swear aloud at myself when I've checked something. 
Its common to ""tragedise"" where you think of the worst case scenario where, for instance, you didn't copy that file at work. A good mental exercise to counter this is to take this to the extreme and then flip it to the best case
Example of worst case: didnt copy the file &gt; not available to your boss when he needs it &gt; looks a moron at the board meeting &gt; fired (step away from the situation and think how likely is that to happen, seriously? It's almost comical) 
Example of best case: didn't copy the file &gt; the file was wrong &gt; you didn't send it to your boss who presented it &gt; boss thanks you for not making him look a fool &gt; Promoted 

Hope this helps, 
Stay strong "
"Hi! I can relate to how you feel, for sure! I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety for several years now. Recently, I was diagnosed with BPD, panic disorder, and agoraphobia on top of bipolar. It hit me much the same way as you are describing. But, my wife and friends helped me to realize that the labels for those things were just that- labels for things I’d already been living with for a long time. Literally nothing changed, except now I had names for the things I was feeling. And all that did? Was empower me to search out strategies and supports for how to cope more effectively with those feelings. I think that once the initial shock of discovering that something was different from what you had known, you’ll find that now you are stronger in your ability to fight/advocate/care for yourself. Remember- you are loved- even by strangers like me! Take care of yourself! "
"I spent a lot of time researching Asian culture to understand more about my parents. I get what you mean- there is no talking about things with them most times, especially when theres so much guilt associated to risking them getting angry or defensive. All you can really do is protect yourself. Limit exposure to them, know the cues for when they're about to yell at RUN away. Practice self care. Know your triggers, leave before you get TOO triggered. Understand the culture, why they say or do what they do. Hopefully you don't live with them, that makes it even harder to protect yourself. I moved out for my mental health, and i love living alone. It's expensive, but it's worth not being in a toxic environment. And I can control the amount of exposure I have to my mom and retreat to a safe place when it gets too much. Work on trying to find a balance between appeasing them AND taking care of yourself! "
"Stimulants aren’t good for stopping racing thoughts because the adrenaline spike causes racing thoughts.  You’re taking too much Ritalin.  If you want to slow down your thoughts you need to train your brain to focus, let go, rest and meditate.  Taking more Ritalin is just going to make it worse.  You need some more info on your medications before you assume you know how they work.

My guess is that when you take another Ritalin, it causes a spike in dopamine which will clarify your thoughts but dopamine degrades into norepinephrine, which is adrenaline.  So you get pleasure than excitement normally.  You’re hijacking the system and it’s no different than a smoker chain smoking or a coke head sniffing line after line.  Yeah it takes away the anxiety for a little bit but then you’re worse off.

Use Xanax for racing thoughts if that’s what you get prescribed because Ritalin is not for that."
"First of all, any therapist is a professional. This means that they are well aware about their need for disclosure. But mainly it means that they consider your well-being as the most important thing. ANY therapy relies on these fundamental ideas. That is why psychotherapy on pedophilia is five to six times more likely to work than any therapy on alcoholism. To get to you: what could be more serious than desiring children sexually? No matter how fucked up you think you are, your therapist will have heard similar and - most likely - worse stories in the past. It is one of the best things about therapy that you experience how normal you are regularly. We all have that twisted fear of having thoughts or personality traits that make us different from others and will exclude us from our society. Understanding that this might be a reflexive thought that helped homo sapiens to develop to a social and very successful animal is the first step to demystifying your fears. And if you have some real and diagnosable difference in certain aspects of your personality - like I have with my ADD - a therapist will help you understand that this just means that you are somewhere in the spectrum of perfectly normal and fine human behavior that is just slightly off the thin line that eg the media make us believe what we should be like, look like or behave like. 

So don't stress out about it. You will be fine. You are fine. "
"Lol I have a habit of saying too much, it’s a habit I’ve worked on in therapy in the past ��

It sounds like what you’re going through must be really scary for you. I’d be feeling frustrated and lonely if I felt I hadn’t been understand. 

Have you been honest with who you’ve talked to about what you’ve experienced? What about when you’ve been taken to the hospital? I’m not a mental health pro so it’s not really responsible for me to say too much but if you are hearing voices and experiencing these “absent episodes” (dissociating?) that doesn’t sounds like your run-of-the-mill anxiety and depression symptoms.

Medication could help, although I’ve had similar experiences you’ve had with several courses of different anti-depressants. I don’t know what you took but it doesn’t sound to me like they would necessarily deal with the symptoms you talk about. Also I don’t know about you, but I feel medication doesn’t really fix anything. It deals with the issues we experience with day-to-day life but not with what might be the cause deep down. 

I get what you mean when you say talking doesn’t help. That was my experience for the first 10(!) years of trying to get help through then NHS. However, I encourage you to keep trying. A diagnosis by a pro can help but talking about things out loud means that you’re not bottling it up which I believe can quite often be the cause of mental illness. The more you talk about what you’re feeling the better you’ll get at being able to communicate it to people in a way they might understand. The more people you talk to about it the higher the chance you’ll come across someone who will get what you’re saying. 

I told my therapist things I would never, ever have said to anyone else up to that point, even if I was being tortured. Those things weren’t secrets, they were things that even I didn’t know until I took the time to talk about it. I don’t think it’s necessarily that I need to be understood but that I need to understand myself. I’m of the opinion that everyone can benefit from some talking therapy. Everyone has their own problems and no one is so perfect they don’t need to try and be better. I’ve found that talking about myself has helped develop a deeper empathy for others which I feel a lot of people in the world need a lot more of, myself included, in order to coexist. 

I don’t know if anybody has told you this recently or ever but there’s nothing wrong with you. I think you know just as well as I do that everybody is fucked up in their own way and because of that we’re all deserving of the best life possible. You’ve already worked hard it seems so keep going. The thing is there’s no quick fix. These sorts of things take time.  Also sorry for going on. I guess I have more work to do but take that as an example of talking helping ! It was quite therapeutic actually so I guess thanks for listening!"
"As plain meditation, no, but I knit and embroider and it does help a lot. I noticed I need to keep my hands busy, and then I focus only on that. "
"Change activities. No harm in that. Nobody is good at everything. Everybody is good at something.
Or you could ask questions. Research it online."
Doesn’t sound like this will be a constructive therapeutic relationship from how you’ve talked about her. I suggest finding a new therapist.
I am here too. Never think you have no one to talk to. It’s saved my life a couple of times just talking to someone so I want to pass this on:)
"I appreciate it thank you. We try to help her and get her help, but anytime we do she fights us tooth and nail because she thinks she's all fine."
"I never really understood why people get upset at this. 

Crossposting where relevant is expressly permitted and even encouraged by reddiquette. "
I really needed this I just woke up from a 15 hour sleep and keep having those intense lows :/ self care can get really hard but def a necessity
"I so greatly appreciate that advice I'm just trying to pay back everybody that has helped me in the past so any advice like that is very welcome
"
I'm sorry you feel this way. I think you know that you need help. A rhetorical question. Are you willing to see a therapist or speak to a doctor?
"I'm thinking about getting one pet or two so that i feel responsible for them and not attempt to kill myself, while i'm also entertained by them."
"Keep yourself busy at all times, make plans to ensure you always have something to look forward to and in your spare time learn how to meditate. "
"Mom says I don’t have autism, but I’m guessing she’s lying to me. I should see if my counselor can arrange some tests without her meddling."
Ok! Good to hear. I guess it all boils down to: are you content with the life you are living? Getting no pleasure sounds bad in my point of view.
"Report him, if you can. I recommend having a good, long talk with your counselor or other confidant about the self injury feelings.

Feel better."
"Sounds like depression to me, but you should see a psychiatrist to be sure. 

Depression is treatable and your life can get better. Stay strong! "
"Thank you. I definitely let myself get worked up, but breaking the cycle is important and not something I had considered. I appreciate your help!"
"Yeah, generally long-distance therapy is for people who are considered low-risk, but tragically it's also hardest for those people to seek help. "
"You mentioned that in the waiting room she had to stop you from trying to punch people? Either way, talk to a therapist. That’s your best bet. "
You should tell this to your psychiatrist hearing things are from another condition. Maniac can cause strange behavior. Dont let it get it to you
"Excuse meeee. My 3 sons are ALL on the Autism Spectrum (professionally DIAGNOSED), and NONE of them are ""living brainstems"" you ignorant piece of shit. There is high-functioning Autism, you know. I am on the Spectrum too and I have an IQ of 130, I have a house, children, and I am able to live and function day to day from paying bills to making supper for all of us.

Want to rethink that, ignoramus?"
"Hi, you seem to already understand very deeply what your actions are like, I would suggest talking with your parents seriously about it, how can they stay careless if you are self-harming? Or seek professional advice because it may be more than ocd. I really do feel for you, and thinking of getting an OCD check myself. Take care and try something, sharing it with people is the first step. Well Done"
"I had 8 rounds of ECT for depression. Its really affected my mind, and not in a good way. My memory is really messed up, and I have real trouble navigating when I drive my car (trouble understanding maps and GPS) - I was never like this before. Also, I sometimes have trouble finding words - again, not something I had ever experienced. As far as I can tell, it made no difference to my depression. 

"
"I have done similar things. My thought was I didn't want people to think it was suicide. I would rather go out with friends and family thinking it was an accident. In other words They wouldn't think poorly of me if I survived. I agree with one of the other comments, a therapist can help you figure out why you are doing this, and that can lead to overcoming it. I feel for you, it's a difficult path."
I'm sure they love you with all their heart but maybe just don't understand what you're going through. If they haven't experienced anything like you're going through they may not know how to help. The best thing to do is to go see a therapist or someone to talk to who will understand and be able to help you cope. I wish you the best of luck. Remember there's always someone out there who cares❤️
"I've come across a lot of rubbish GPs but there's always one somewhere that is on the ball, once you find them, don't give them up easily! I recommend people go through the different Drs at a surgery until they find one who is listening and helpful or switch surgeries and try the same thing there. They might just refer you on to a mental health team or service but that's getting somewhere at least "
"It sounds like you are normal person, just a bit moody sometimes.  That's all.  You can learn to cope with that and still function just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

A therapist might help you work on skills like counting to 10 when you are angry or doing something to cheer yourself up when you feel bad, but ultimately I think it sounds like you are already doing everything about right.  Just hang in there."
Same story here . The difference is that I am very bad at making friends . I never had many friends . One of those friends who was super close to me left me showing some silly reason . Now I have no real friend to share and spend time with . But I don't feel anything though in my head  I know how lonely I am . I am in peace with myself . I have admitted that I'll never have anyone and that's okay .
"Seriously good on you for writing that, and writing it so well. I'm in the UK and still a student so I don't have he same issues with jobs in relation to my mental health issues but it's crazy to think that people still don't see mental health as just as serious as physical health. And it's good for your fiancee that she's with someone who takes it as seriously as they should. I hope you hear back."
"Thank you! At very least I feel like I have an illusion of free will, so it's kind of you to say. It's just been nice having a talk with someone who understands the same kind of stuff, even if I can't help solve your philosophical question.

Edit: Yes, information overload! I think they say we see more new information in a day than someone in the 1500s saw in a lifetime (and most of it's bad news)."
"Those are all side effects of escitalopram. You should definitely talk to your doctor about this medicine. It might not be right for you. That or the dosage will be lowered. Or you'll be asked if you want to try taking it in the morning instead. It's possible that after a while these side effects will fade but whether you want to continue this medication is up to you, talk it over with your doctor."
"You can't help someone who isn't able to help themselves- you can only offer patience, support and no judgement. That's literally all you can do, and that is the best you can do. Don't put that pressure on yourself to take away someone else's pain. By being there, even passively, is a huge help. She know's you are there for her, and feeling like some support is around, does make a huge difference. "
"Your therapists statement borders on suggesting an unethical development.  Sometimes like in rural communities, a therapist kr medical doctor is part of the community, and those professionals have to balance those duel relationships... so you must simply talk to your about how he intends to handle the interaction and ask you what you want him to do... he should really take the initiative on this..."
"&gt; Fuck this. You can beat this stuff, you can change.

How do you know? I mean, technically, everyone is always changing, but in that sense it doesn't mean much. Lay it out step by step for how I get a girlfriend. I need a girlfriend FIRST, THEN all the other stuff will become easier. 

&gt; But technically, I do not NEED her. ... So you must find self-reliance. 

You must break up with your partner. If you feel worse then that just means you need to develop more self-reliance. If you feel just as good or better then it was the right decision. Either way, the right thing to do is to break up with her. So, you're going to do that right now, right?"
"Don't do what I initially done when I first got diagnosed which was read all the horrible stuff people think about us. Not saying there's no truth behind some of it. However there's so much more to us than just being abusive, manipulative monsters. A diagnosed borderline that accepts they have problems and is willing to try and change it can be a beautiful person. We have a lot of good qualities if you can get past our bad ones. DBT is a huge thing for helping us learn to cope and change our thought process. Lastly this doesn't change who you are at your core, it's simply an explanation for some of it. All the best and it does get better, I promise."
"Haircut is about the cheapest service I can think of that involves touch. After that, massage, Reiki treatment, chiropractor, tattoo session. I've been through this for a few months now and then, and I found other avenues for receiving touch in the context of paid services. Also, there is Cuddle Comfort, online networking for people who just want to meet up and cuddle non sexually. I never made use of it, and there are a lot of ""professional cuddlers"" on there. Basically, getting some human contact through one of the services mentioned above chills me out enough that I can approach/date potential partners without such a need for contact right away. "
"I had this exact issue a few weeks ago. Have you tried NHS Time to Talk? Not that they're a great option, they risk assessed me for suicide then ended up not giving me any help. But might be worth a try for you, they organise assessment calls within a week or two.

If not, there's loads of BACP accredited counsellors out there doing private work. It's pricey but they can fit you in very quickly and most offer a free getting to know you session. I contacted one on a Wednesday afternoon, had a getting to know you session on the Thursday morning, and began my regular session the following Tuesday. If it's rapid help you need, the price can be worth it."
"The best thing to do will be to set yourself up with some outpatient support, namely a psychiatrist and a therapist. They can help with the transition, and more importantly, hopefully provide you with the support you need to not be hospitalized again (although if you do, that’s okay!). 

Telling people is up to you, although I do know that it is difficult to live in the sort of isolation you will impose on yourself by not letting anyone in. 

Go home. Sleep in your own bed. Eat something you really like. Call someone who loves you. Take the meds you were prescribed. Take care of yourself as best you can. I’m here if you need someone to talk to. "
"Wow.  This is concerning. Is your fiance's mother sick and in need of help?  If not, why couldn't the move wait until you were done with school/internship?  It sounds a bit odd to upend your studies unless it was a dire emergency.

Also, was there a reason why you had to move with him?  Could you have stayed on your own for the semester to finish things out?

You need support and if you cannot get it from your fiance, that is another red flag, I think.  

It sounds like you lost a lot with this move.  Your feelings of sadness and loss make a lot of sense.  Try to acknowledge that for yourself even if others can't.  I hope you can find a way forward!"
"make sure you talk to your therapist at the start of the next session and describe your feelings following this session. Be specific about how you felt, how long the feelings lasted for, and any changes in behaviour (ie withdrawn, sleeping, etc) that resulted. Its really important that you communicate lines of questioning that are upsetting so they can be better handled next time. Some discomfort in therapy is ok, but if you are really distressed, thats something to look at, review, and work on so it doesnt happen again. Therapy should never be brutal or destructive. Thats not beneficial.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and give yourself a hug. You deserve it :)"
"Thank you so much. I often wonder if I do have Bipolar disorder or something similar, but my parents are the uber conservative types that believe that mental illness is something that can be fixed by finding new friends and going to church. So I'm kinda wary of talking about it with them, and they'd be the ones who'd be paying since I'm still on their insurance etc. It's complicated. But I do tend to isolate myself and listen to music/read and that, which definitely helps. I tend to shut myself off from others when I'm feeling down, and so I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I've been trying to convince myself to tell my friends/bf/anyone about it, and so once I work up the courage to do that, I'm sure it'll help at least a little (just having someone to sympathize etc.). It's tough and will definitely be a process, but I'll get there someday. I really appreciate all of your help and advice. "
"From what I read, you had a moment where you thought your whole existence was a pain. How much pain does one have to feel in order to want to try to take his own life?
I understand that feeling, but now you consider it a bad decision and that already is a step into progression.

Your mother is your mother and you are your own person, there is no need to follow her steps. Maybe you feel like you couldn't save your mother and that's a really normal feeling, it's a part of survivors guilt. The feeling of wanting to save someone is something that makes us human and saving one person is okay. That person to save is yourself.

Just to be frank, if you only look at the negative aspects of everything, the only thing you will see is the dark void that swallows you up. 
It is going to be really hard, but try to look at atleast one small positive aspect of it all. That light will be a small ray of hope in a deep cave. 

Just believe in your treatment and trust your nurses, psychologists and psychiatrists. They're there for you and I wish you didn't have to feel so much pain, I promise you that it will get better.

I wish you a good night sleep and a blessed day."
"Maybe this will be helpful. A therapist is not a psychologist or a psychiatrist. This is a common misconception. Therapists aren't so much about diagnosing as they are about understanding you, how you see your world and your place in your world, and no quality practitioner would jump to a diagnosis like DID. A good therapist's goal is to help you be your best, healthy, autonomous self. A therapist may ask you to explain your beliefs and how they fit into your life and then work with you to find solutions that fit you. The therapist may not totally understand what your beliefs are, but a responsible therapist will either try to educate themselves for future sessions or help you find additional, appropriate resources. Sometimes you have to go through multiple therapists to find a good fit, but they are out there! I for one do not understand what your beliefs are, but when I am eventually a therapist I will certainly be sure to remain open to others beliefs and ways of living, even if they aren't my own. This is the only way to go, as everyone has their own life and experiences that can never be fully understood by others, but can be accepted by others. "
"Hi, I'm 32. I have been admitted to a Psych Ward 4 times. Possibly 5...I kinda loss count. During my first visit I was placed in an Isolation Room. White walls, small room, locked with a camera panning down on me as I sat upright in the bed. I was mad as hell to be in there but never the less...I was there. As I sat there in the dark for over 15 hours, I refused to move. In fact I think I was in there for exactly 32 hours..... I didn't sleep, I didn't scratch my itches, I didn't budged. I wanted to show those assholes who put me in there just how crazy I could be...And you know what that did? It instead showed ME just how crazy I could be... I began seeing visions of things I haven't remembered since youth. I was watching TV in my head of full blown episodes of sitcoms and cartoons WITH SOUND. I tapped into a part of my brain where I literally was seeing things as if it were real life and it scared the shit out of me. Your story reminds me of that experience I had. So it makes me come to the conclusion that maybe you are spending way to much time by yourself? Are you being social or anti-social? What you are experiencing is possibly hallucinations. Get out of your own head, go talk to someone again, and get prescribed some meds if you think you need them. Good Luck bro.

"The part where you open up in your group chat and in uni kind of applies to me, but with meeting online people. I’m actually more talkative and seem cooler than I actually am on the internet, but once I begin voice talking or meet irl I shrink back to my shy insecure self. I think that this has to do with the fact that your group of “friends” know what you act like and as a result you act the same around them so you wouldn’t be seen as something you’re not. You actually already explained it pretty well already. 


I’m actually happy that you could open up in uni, whereas me when I got to uni didn’t change because a lot of the people that knew me also went to my uni so I kinda just stayed the same. It seems like your good at making first impressions, but I think you can apply this to your friend group as well by showing them the same thing on a one to one basis not as the whole group though because it would shock the group and you get “wow she talked” or some other condescending bs. 


Another thing about your friend group, I noticed in every group there’s a “in” group that basically founded the group and they hang out together and do everything together and then there are the “others” who either have joined later into the group or are friends with the “in” group. I’m in a school organization and the officers seem really close and I saw them all at a coffee shop studying, not even one by campus but near where I commute from. It’s really frustrating when you see you can never be part of the main group and it’s even harder for us because you mostly need superficial charm and a high drive to get in it. The only real solution I think would be to make your own friend group, which is also just as difficult. I don’t know if you should take this advice though cause I don’t have as much experience, I’m usually fine just being where I’m at like how you’re still part of the “out” group.


Out of order, but the part about talking to your Mum resonated with me, where you lie in order to keep up an act in your case where you didn’t watch that show.  I feel like I’ve been doing his a lot lately as well, and I don’t like lying, but I do a lot of white lies. Someone asks me what my major is, mine is history, and I reply that it’s nursing. If I said history I’d get mouthful about how that has no career options, but with nursing people go like yeah that’s a solid field. Not for you, but the reason I do this is both to avoid conversations and cultivate a image that I don’t have.


I do have to say that you’re a good writer and I can barely get my paragraphs in order or have enough substance to make a long post. Keep it up, you’re like me but with a girl and probably a bit older and have “friends” and a boyfriend. Though, I have a twin brother who is like your boyfriend to me and understands what I’m going through and we can talk unhindered, gotcha there."
"Back atchya. :) My hubby is letting me order hot wings...and YES, I get the humor in that. That actually is kind of amusing. :) Thank you so much!"
Good thing I dont take risperdal. And were just going to repeat the same things to eachother. Neither of us are going to get anything out of this.
"I have read the list of symptoms for BPD, and it totally sounds like me. With this said, i am not necessarily concerned with labels or diagnosis. "
I think an accumulation of shitty events that have happened over the past year or so that have pushed me into an episode depression. How about u?
I'm sorry you had to deal with him. He's an unhelpful and hurtful person who replied to my comments as well. Best to report him and ignore him. :(
Im in a similar situation. I have autism along with being mentally ill and my mother blames it all on me. I know shes wrong but it gets to me too.
"Is it bad?? Honestly I just can't stand but to feel so right in how I think. Rationally I know it's wrong, but nevertheless I feel that I'm right."
Listen to me closely. You need to go see a doctor. And you need to do it as soon as possible. Those symptoms are not something you want to ignore.
"My psychiatrist referred me to a neuropsychologist to get a neuropsych exam done.  It took a full day, but told me a lot about myself and my ADHD."
Or one way is to have a weekly meal or coffee outing together. I really enjoyed that with my mom so we had a time to check in together once a week
Thank you for speaking sense. I was worried this thread might turn into a mess of armchair diagnoses. I really think this is the best course here.
"Those beliefs come from past trauma, both growing up and in my first marraige.  I'm working to heal and change them,  but this is something else. "
"&gt;**After the inquest, Aimee’s friend Stacey Ansell said:**

&gt;Aimee is truly missed by many people. If she knew how many people are heartbroken over her passing she would be overwhelmed.  
It deeply saddens me that she felt she couldn’t reach out to any of us.

Well...she did and the person that should have supported her insulted her for doing so.

Why would you ever try that again?"
"As the other comment said, you need to see a doctor right away.

In the meantime, try taking a few deep breaths. Close your eyes, breathe in slowly, hold it a second, breathe out slowly. Do it three times. This may help you calm down a little so you can take some good next steps.

If you don't think it can wait until Monday or you don't have a doctor on call you can use, go to the nearest hospital. "
He's had milder versions of the symptoms before but with years-long gaps in between. This is the first time that it's led to him injuring himself physically. He used to be a drinker but he stopped cold turkey after the last period of mental health symptoms a few years ago. That does help! Nice to hear it might be something reversable. Do you know how we should get him to a doctor in this situation?
"Hi Ultraviolence, I feel you. I find myself slipping into fantasy all the time throughout the day and it can get distracting. I also find that when I think about friends/family in my head I get more of a emotional response then when I see them in real life.

&amp;#x200B;"
"I think something to keep in mind is that if you try the medication, you don't have to be on it forever. Give it a shot, if you decide you don't like it then you don't have to keep doing it. I would at the very least also recommend that you try therapy. This could help you in a lot of ways and is a good combination with medication and even good without medication if you decide totally against meds. "
"I'll tell you what though. Keeping active on this post is keeping me occupied whilst bringing all my feeling to the forefront and making me confront them. I haven't even thought about contacting her in hours. I mean, I've thought about letting her see this post one day so she can she see what I'm feeling as i'd never be able to say all of this out loud to her. But that's not a job for anytime soon. "
"Please know that neither psychopathy nor sociopathy are actual mental illnesses or diagnostic terms, so clinically you are neither. The closest would be antisocial personality disorder (APD).

That said, racism, xenophobia, low self-esteem and suicide attempts don't suggest APD; they suggest something more impulsive and angry than emotionless, like ODD or BPD or an impulse-control disorder like IED."
"She sounds like a mean spirited terrible Mother and I'm sorry you have to live with her. The reality that any qualified psychotherapist would give you is that your level of personal responsibility for your problems being there, or developing, is less than 20%. The responsibility for overcoming them however is yours 80%. Daunting, but it can be done.

But seriously, what the fuck is up with your Mom?"
"Stick to a Male therapist with a Ph.D or Counseling background. Avoid social workers and  older women.  Make sure they offer a free consult  either by phone or in-person. Tell them what you expect, don't pay more $100, and after the first session, follow your gut about coming back.  Only stick with someone that gives you positive vibes, therapy IS about the relationship more so than techniques. GL. "
"Yea if I’m being honest I had to lie to lie to my parents and tell them I had attempted suicide so they would help me check into a mental hospital when I was feeling horrible. I’m a lot better now and can’t believe how far I’ve come, but yea when you’re at your lowest lows sometimes people think you’re better than you are because you’re not doing “crazy” or “depressed” things. "
"I get that, but your job isn't to help the patients by treating them.  That's medical staffs' job.  Your job is physical safety.  If you want ton*get training* to become medical staff, and thus have a better idea what to say and when to say it, that's one thing and more power to you.  But for now, whatever your good intentions are, I promise you they are going to hurt vulnerable people in ways you cannot begin to foresee.  Simply *meaning well* is not enough, and someone who *means well* by stepping on your foot hurts just as much as someone who deliberately set out to hurt you.

Just do the job you already have, and do it quietly and professionally."
"I've been inpatient 5 times in 7 years. You don't me and I don't know you, but I want to thank you for caring for me when I felt hopeless and broken and terrified. Thank you for bringing me nausea meds when I was too sick to lift myself upright. Thank you for making sure I got a tray when I was too weak to go to the cafeteria.  Thank you for believing me and sitting in on my conversation with the psychiatrist so he wouldn't continue to belittle me and degrade me. Thank you for the extra socks, and letting me use the toiletries I brought with me. Thank you for loving me when I couldn't love myself. We need people that get it. We need people like you. "
"If you were still on the meds I would say it’s definitely possible. Some people with bipolar disorder don’t like taking their meds or refuse to take them because they enjoy the “highs” (mania) and creativity/ productivity that comes with them even despite the negatives. But it’s not likely that there would be a lingering effect beyond a few weeks at most. At 5 months, the drugs are well out of your system. 

I would wonder if it’s actually the opposite? Could your BD and ADHD be interacting in such a way that you are currently experiencing a depressive episode + struggling with to concentrate anyway? I don’t know it’s just a thought. "
"There are many other things worth recommending before weed, which is known to affect people very differently depending on their condition, physical make up, the strain of weed, etc. Cannabis can cause major problems for some people (myself included). I really advise against randomly recommending it to people. It can help some people, sure, but it's very risky. Changes in lifestyle, mindfulness meditation, diet, exercise, counseling, etc. can all help and are much lower risk.

Speaking as someone who's nearly destroyed their life multiple times because of weed, please be more cautious with this kind of talk. I know you mean well but please be careful."
"You should feel bad. Everybody is entitled to their own lifestyle choice. Just because somebody's transgender doesn't mean their less of a person. And trolling message boards with the sole intention of hurting others makes you a terrible person. It sounds to me like you have your own unresolved issues in regards to your own gender.

You need therapy. I know that you said you've talked to a counsellor already. But you need to be completely and 100 percent honest with them. Otherwise they can't help you. Tell them what you've told us on here. If not, nothing will ever change and nothing will ever better. And that's not me being mean. That's tough love."
"I have a question unrelated to this that is normally the reason I delete these posts or what stops me from getting help; is it normal for me to switch back from depressed to not depressed? When it happens I don’t get happy, and really I’m still a little sad but not as sad. Sometimes I’ll get angry for no reason when I switch back not being as bad. It’s tiring switching like this. Sometimes I’ll be bad for a few days, sometimes I’ll switch back and forth a few times in a day. Rarely, I’ll get a big surge of confidence and energy for a about a day. Those rare “up” days are the only times I feel slightly human, I’ll still be a little foggy and off.      It’s those rare up days and my weird, extreme/frequent mood swings that make me wonder if I’m just a hormonal teenager and maybe this is normal and I’m being dramatic, and they discourage me from seeking help or talking about it "
"I think Canada has assisted suicide. Ive thought about this a lot myself, suicide by police is a way but you'd have to put the burden of your death on a stranger that'll likely take that anger out on others. There aren't  any ways I could think of that wouldn't put your death on another person. Could find your way to a prison and start talking shit. Do all the shit that causes cancer, sow your butthole shut and start eatin, there are tons of ways. Start bangin dirty dirty hores. I've gotten pretty lucky that I'm alive and clean with all the same shit you have and have gone down your path or self loathing. 

you could just live with yourself like the rest of us do that don't want to exist, sucks that whether you believe it or not people care if you live or die and hurting yourself will hurt them the rest of their lives. You can grow a set and live or start handing out crosses to bear. It's your choice "
"Unless your thoughts/feelings/actions are causing you distress or preventing you from leading the life you want (note that I do NOT say a ""normal"" life), then don't worry about it. Some of these tests can be great for self reflection and insight. I'm not talking about the Facebook and magazine quizzes, of course, lol. Like checking your symptoms on webMD, take the results with a grain of salt.

With the way the questions are worded, some make it difficult to answer in a truly accurate/reflective manner. For example, ""I find it difficult to approach people"". Absolutely not, if I need help from an associate in a store. Absolutely yes, if I need to network with random people for job prospects and pretend to be friendly and interested and interesting when really the whole premise of the situation is to suck up to each other for personal gain (who in the hell decided that should be normal and acceptable?)."
"With all due respect if we continue to give people the benefit of the doubt in how they react to people when they tell them ""I suffer from mental illness"" then we will never get ahead.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that mental illness exists. You don't have to know the scientific ins and outs about any given mental illness to show some empathy to someone. But by downplaying a person's feelings by implying it's not a big deal when it IS a big deal is the epitome of ignorance.

Do people downplay cancer to someone's face?  Why would mental illness be any different? Is it because it's an illness of the mind? 

This boss could have just said as little as possible, and accommodated this persons needs in order to achieve well being but  downplayed it and didn't think about how unprofessional it sounded.

If this boss were to behave this way at my office, they would be reprimanded for it. Hands down. "
"Ah, your situation makes a bit more sense then. I can see why you want to throw in the towel, because the situation does seem hopeless and unsolvable. That's very painful to experience, and I'm so sorry that you are in that boat right now. 

Like I said, I would never say that things will get better. There's a real chance it won't and you will struggle every day of your life. I can't guarantee that these things will be solved or go away.  But I will say that as long as there is still chances things will improve, you might as well take those chances before you really and truly peace out of here.

Don't think about who is worse off. Your feelings are valid right here, right now. Your agony is real, and it is justified. But right now, it sounds like instead of dying, you need someone to listen to you. It seems as though your family is awful and your resources are limited...but the good thing is you still have access to the internet! Use us to bounce ideas off of so that you can brainstorm solutions for your issues.

Like I mentioned, I'm all ears. I love listening to others. We can keep talking through messenger and I'd check it a messenger every other day or so!

I would say more but I'm falling asleep (it's about 1:30am here and I am working every Sunday and Monday to make sure I didn't miss anything. However, I will periodically be checking this thread!! So don't think that I've given up on helping out!"
"**Types of National Security Clearance in the UK**: [site](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/security-clearance/Types%20of%20national%20security%20clearance)
    
    
There are four levels of security clearance:
    
Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)   
Security Check (SC)      
Counter-Terrorism Check (CTC)    
Developed Vetting (DV)     
    
    
Now researching to see which is most commonly used in cybersecurity... Brb

**What Security Clearance do you need for a job in Cyber Security?**: [site](https://www.morson.com/blog/2016/12/what-security-clearance-do-you-need-for-a-job-in-cyber-security)    
    
**Security Check**    
Security Check (SC) is **the most common type of vetting process for cyber security professionals** and once complete is valid for five years for contractors and 10 years for permanent employees. You’ll need SC clearance if your role requires substantial access to secret or top secret assets and information.    
    
You need to have been a UK resident for at least 5 years, and need to have successfully completed all stages of the vetting process, including:.   
    
 - Baseline Personnel Security Standard
 - Departmental/Company Records Check
 - **Security Questionnaire**
 - Criminal Record Check
 - Credit Reference Check
 - Security Service Check
    
**Developed Vetting**   
Developed Vetting (DV) is the most comprehensive form of security vetting in the UK, and also the most expensive. IT professionals will only be required to have DV clearance if they’re working in the intelligence or security agencies, or if their role involves having substantial unsupervised access to top secret assets and information.    
    
To complete Developed Vetting, professionals must go through the following stages:
    
 - Baseline Personnel Security Standard    
 - Departmental / Company Records Check    
 - DV Security Questionnaire    
 - Criminal Record Check    
 - Credit Reference Check and review of personal finances

I'm seeing a lot of people say two things:      
1) They won't access your medical records if they don't have a reason. - or -    
2) if you are dishonest on the questions and they find out, you lose the clearance.
     
I still don't know how to handle this question. Technically, you already have the clearance and you were honest when you applied for it. It's good for a good period of time. I think getting therapy would be beneficial."
"I've been hospitalized quite a lot. It can suck and feel bad that you have to be there, of course. Nobody likes being cooped up anywhere, it's human nature i think. But if you're really having a hard time, which it sounds like you are, hospitals really can help. It's hard to find the right way to help your specific symptoms when a doctor only sees you once a week, or once a month or whatever your schedule is. In a hospital, you have doctors and other professionals all working together to find the way to make you feel better or at least make you not feel as bad as you are right now. That's what hospitals are about. Not curing you or solving all the issues at hand, but rather bringing you back to a tolerable place where you feel like you can live your life without having your symptoms trouble you all the time/most the time. 

Yeah, they probably will prescribe you meds, but that can work sometimes. Finding the right med can really help you feel like you can deal with your issues and still live life. Of course that's not the only part of the solution, that's why hospitals make sure you have a plan set up for therapy after you leave. 

Everyone there is trying to help you, even if it doesn't seem like it. Take it from someone who has been in way more than i ever would want to. Talk to your wife about how you feel and maybe make a pros and cons list of going to the hospital. It seems like a big scary decision, but it's only for a while and you will be able to care for your family better afterwards.

Please message me if you wanna talk more about it. I really sympathize with how you feel. I hope you feel better man, it's a long road but you gotta keep walking to get to your destination, ya know?

As for getting there if you decide to, talk to your doctor and see if he can speak to the hospital about getting admitted. You don't have to be ""institutionalized"" to go to the hospital. You can choose to go there. He probably knows someone at the hospital, a doctor or something, that can talk with you and see if they think going there would be a good idea. You can tell them how you've been feeling and they'll talk with their colleagues and figure it out. 

That's the least stressful way of getting there, but it doesn't always work for one reason or another. Sometimes they just can't get you in via doctor to doctor conversation. In this situation, you unfortunately have to go to the ER (emergency room). I know this sucks. It totally does. But if you really feel like the hospital can help, it might be what you need to do. Not everyone goes to the hospital because they're in imminent danger to themselves or others, but if you feel like you are, going to the ER is the best option.

People usually get admitted for a few common reasons, not to say these are the only ones, but these  generally will provide the doctor with a explanation of why you wanna go that he/she will agree with:

\-To find out the correct medication for you, in an environment where they can really observe the symptoms and test different meds to see which one(s) work best for you,

\-If you feel/act suicidal, or are wanting to harm yourself

\-If you feel homicidal, or are wanting to harm someone else

\-In episodes of mania, depression or psychosis where the symptoms are causing issues that make it hard/impossible to function in normal life

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, go ahead and message me if you have any questions or just wanna talk. Good luck my friend :)"
Do you know of any emergency lines I can call. At the moment it isn't very convenient for me to go to therapy. I have an appointment next Tuesday.
"Get in to see a therapist asap if you aren't seeing someone already, and if you are, give them a call! Sounds like you're experiencing a delusion. "
Have you skyped your bf yet? Please be prepared if he gets upset after seeing your cuts. I would surely be upset if I see a loved one getting hurt.
I can give you some insight. But it'll have to be through message at a later time. Like tomorrow or something. So let me know if you're interested.
I don't wanna see you kill yourself OP. But I also know that I probably can't change your mind either. I hope you find whatever you're looking for.
"I hope you're okay &amp; that he didn't hurt you. It's hard to say, ""No,"" when they aren't asking or listening, especially if most of it's fine. :("
I struggle so much with personal hygiene when my depression gets bad. I always feel better after showering but just getting it done is such a task.
"I think once youre recovered it's fine to have kids, just make sure that you are ready and healed so that you can care for the kid as best you can."
It is a great thing that you have shared your experience here. It will give a ray of hope to people who are suffering from anxiety and depression.
It’s definitely hard. Just try to practice as much self care as you can. You deserve peace too. Just don’t forget about you through all of it.
Oh wow - never heard of that. I wonder if it’s common to feel like it when dealing with some mental illness. Never heard the name for it though.
"Thanks, I do see a therapist but I've never mentioned anything like this and I know I should get around to that. I just feel silly talking about it"
"That sounds like cyclothymia, you can get that treated if you go get some mood stabilizer or anti-depressant (depends if its depression or bipolar)"
"This is exactly right. I am in this exact position right now. I am having a hard time and am struggling.   


I hope you feel better. Hugs from me!"
"Very few people know how often I think about death. If they knew they’d put me in a hospital and never let me out, so I just don’t discuss it. "
"Well,i dont even know how the clock works..

I havent paid attention in school at all. I cant. My mind wont let me.

So i havent learned anything.."
"What peeves me the most is when people ask ""Hey, how are you?"" only to find out that they're asking because they are going to ask for a favor. Wiw."
"Why'd you delete? :) You can share here. This is a safe place for all of us. We are all suffering from something, so please come back and share. :)"
"Yah the classes are free, most of them are during the day though as I think they target elderly people. There are two yoga classes on the weekend. "
You can chat with me if you like. I believe everyone has the right to self determination and that includes suicide. I'm pretty blunt about things.
"You're welcome. ""Today you, tomorrow me"" I think we may be in different timezones, but please feel free to leave me messages if you want to talk.  "
"are there actually meds out there that treat disassociation?  or do u think  TMS , ketamine (i know it causes it short term^^) , or ect would work?"
"have you already sought out professional help? if you haven't, please consider it, especially if you feel like the thoughts might turn into actions"
"Don't be afraid to talk about how you feel. You'll feel much better getting these thoughts and feelings out of your system. There's also no shame in getting help if you ever need it. Talking to a therapist might help you. So I would recommend it. You can also always send me a message if you ever need somebody to talk to. And remember, try to stay productive. It'll help take your mind off your issues."
"Hi! I have been on it three days and my nausea is insane. I vomited during my class on Friday at the college and was legitimately in the bathroom on the floor moaning for like 45 minutes. It was miserable :/ I am up right now at 3 am because I took it at 11 and the nausea won’t go away! I honestly don’t know if any depression is gone or whatever just because I am so sick, and I am only on 5 mg!!!"
"I (24f) struggle with this too! It’s like my body’s response to overwhelming stress now. Been dealing with it for around 4 years now. Feel free to ask me any questions but the things that have helped me the most are my SSRI (Lexapro), Ativan when I just cannot stop being sick and anxious, Magnesium supplements, and journaling. It’s an ongoing battle but I’m much better at dealing with it now."
"I experience similiar, but usually in crowded noisy venues where I just can't hear myself think. Yep, it is totally overwhelming and I need to get some place quiet to clear my head.

I heard it affects people on the autism spectrum quite a lot, but I don't think I have that.

Edit: Just to add I am really into music too and that I talked to quite a few people who experience the same thing or similar."
"I was in your position not that long ago, and I was also afraid of starting a prescription regimen. But about 4 years later, I am so happy to have them. Before, I could not function, despite my best efforts and intentions. The antidepressants helped take the edge off of all the icky feelings and let the rational, not sick, part of me come back. And I didn't have to do nearly as much work. *high five*"
"It’s fine to have multiple diagnoses, I think most people who wind up in mental health system will end up with multiple. I’ve got bipolar GAD panic disorder, there used to be more. It just means you got to work your butt off in therapy, maybe some meds, work hard on creating a healthy lifestyle and routines to protect yourself. 

It’s not the end of the world even though it might feel like it. "
"Sounds like you're already doing a lot to help her. Mental illness is tricky; sometimes you can be doing everything right and progress is still painfully slow. The only thing I can recommend is making sure that she knows putting a little  less on her plate is an option if coursework/graduation is a big stressor. (For context, I have anxiety and depression and I had to drop out of uni because of it.) "
"Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting. This was extremely well said and it means a lot to see these things expressed outside of my / all of our own heads and I'm really grateful you did. I understand/feel/relate to the first half of this so very much -- and can't wait for the day when I will for the second half, too. So happy for your progress and hope it helps inspire lots of us to follow you."
"We are still early in the game here.  I work in sports/entertainment and event planning and we get memos almost every other week about this.  
    
The problem is that currently almost anybody can claim that their dog/cat/hamster/parakeet can claim to be an emotional support/therapy/rescue animal.  The other patrons to the events haven't got the memo and we have to deal with their ""concerns"" as well."
"Going weeks/a month without sex is a long time. I just meant if it was a once in awhile thing. Thats just what my male friends told me. Do you think it's more of an incompatible sex drive issue then?  or you believe it's personal, and he wants to have sex with other girls and just not you? I think it's really hard not to take it personally, I've been there as well. :( but I just thought of it as a incompatibility and I did have some built up frustrations around it.   
He may be private with his devices, but does he share stories about friends that he messages often, do you have a brief idea of who they are and what their relationship to him is like ? "
Hey man I've been there and I've thought a lot about it too. What you're experiencing is called nihilism. And honestly it's all true. The world really won't remember any of us given enough time but that's a good thing because now all those times you messed up get erased. Basically put an optimistic spin on it and it'll make it seem much better. A YouTube channel by the name of In A Nutshell has a really good video on it if you search up optimistic nihilism. The short version though in case you don't is basically if there is no point to life than that's great because now you have the choice to make your own purpose in life and give it meaning yourself.
"I think it can be really helpful to stop and acknowledge that “it’s not ok”. When I was in college and working two jobs, I would try to distract myself and ignore how miserable I was, but then it would break out in these massive panic attacks. Now I find myself doing the same, just pushing back the feelings of dissatisfaction and emptiness. But the other day I just stopped and admitted, “It’s not ok. I’m not ok.” There’s this feeling of relief that comes with accepting it. The next step is identifying why things aren’t ok, and how to fix them. 

I don’t know if that’s relatable, just something I’ve been thinking about I guess. "
"Some of them suck. I mean, really, really suck. 

Some of them are mediocre

Some of them are great.

Don't bother, at all, with anyone you find who sucks..

Make do, if you have to, with mediocre (if there's no one else available, and you need to talk)

But keep looking for great. Once you find one, stick with them

Also

Train your therapist

Some of the most important things you can say are, ""this is working for me"", and ""that is not working for me"" if you do that reliably, over time, your therapist will know to do more of the former and less of the latter. 

Be proactive. Give them regular feedback (like, every session). It makes a big difference."
"That sounds like an irresponsible statement. In other words Bhudda is teaching to only seek superficial relationships.

I believe superficial relationships are worthless other than for distracting one's self.

It's better to try to cultivate a deeply personal relationship with at least one person. No holding back on quirky embarrassing thoughts, no secrets, and no lies.

It's not reasonable to just jump into such a  relationship, but when you start one you should constantly ask yourself whether you are being truthful to yourself and them.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I am not an expert in the field of relationships whatsoever. These are just my opinions."
"I would recommend diving deep into your subconscious. Look at small things you do. I was sexually abused around 3-4 i have no memory of such i just have after effects like ptsd, ocd towards cleanliness, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, cen, trust issues, insomnia, never feelings safe, relationships issues, low self esteem, digestive problems, chronic pain (phantom pain), nightmares, suicidal thoughts, thoughts of sexual abuse, insane thoughts that people in mental hospitals think, random illnesses(flu/cold), marks that i cant remember how i got, short term memory loss, sexual confusion, unable to ask for help because it feels needy and weak. Thats when i linked it all together. 

Its sad to find out but it makes me understand my actions alot better.

But yeah do research on child  sexual abuse symptoms And link what you can to your own memories. for me its spot on so it was easily a dead give away."
"I'm sorry to hear about your friend's situation. Unfortunately for some, we don't get to choose our parents. My thoughts are this: your friend is 16 years old and only has a couple more years until she's able to move out and be on her own. I'd continue to be a good friend to her and help her wait out the storm. I'd let her vent and express her frustration, that way she's not bottling this stuff up. I'd encourage her to seek out counseling or make her aware of mental health and the importance taking care of your mind. Depression is scary and it's important that your friend is educated on the resources around her. Lastly, and as I mentioned before, be kind to her. Let her vent and talk it out. Remind her about patience - two years isn't that long! She's not going to be able to change the behavior of her parents, but she can form her own coping mechanisms to deal and wait out this storm. Hope this helps.
"
"So I went to an Aveda Beauty school, and the same person who owns the school owns the professional salon below it. I started as retail in the salon as a part time job because it was easy to go to school and work in the same building, since it's owned by the same person i was also able to grab whatever hours i could at the school working the same retail postion ($10 an hour they gave me below what the posted wage was) 9 months later i'm managing the salon by myself at 19, in charge of all the inventory, financial reports, etc...and they gave me a dollar raise ($11). I open the school 7:30-11:00 and then operate the salon 11:30-9 (T, W, Th)  and work Mondays 10-7 and then work Friday / Saturday 8-5. In the state of Wisconsin they don't require employers to give you time off for lunch, and my higher ups informed me they don't book off my stylists for lunches because they should ""know how to work breaks around their appointments"". I'm getting absolutely broken down by this company because I'm 19 and they treat me like a child when I've done more for the salon than anyone else since I've been there, and pay all my own bills myself just like any other adult. "
"100% not diagnosing here. 
Just wanted to say that what you describe sounds quite like narcissistic personality disorder. 
Would be worth a Google. "
"A shower can sometimes be that little thing in a morning that boosts you for the day. I know it’s hard to find the motivation sometimes, but try! "
"By your own admission, in the light that you think represents you the best, you don't know how your own survey works.  

Go phishing somewhere else."
"Congratulations, that is a big step. I rushed into going back to work and had to leave again but it sounds like you have prepared well. Stay strong "
"Day 1:  
I didn't give in to a strong urge to burn something just about 15 minutes ago. :) It was hard to push down the compulsion, but I did it! :)"
Fires are nice. I buy stuff if I feel bad usually. I wanna go home to my so. I have to wait out another day and a half. I don't like it w my parents
"Go for a really long hike 1h maybe,but have a good meal first, come home, take a bath or warm shower and start reading a book on bed,  laying down. "
"God. That poor woman and her poor children. 

Don’t be daft is a terrible response to someone warning you that they’re going to kill them self. "
"Good idea, Ill have to stick with and keep trying instead of freaking out. Not sleeping is new for me, i havent been sure where to start, thank you!"
Hello. You can always message me to chat. I am home most times (except the morning when I go on my walk) and I would be willing to talk with you. :)
"I care, and tons of people care!:) you may not realise it but you matter in this world, and you have a purpose! Maybe you just havent found it yet=)"
I had bad experiences with Zoloft and Latuda (an antipsychotic). They both made me really depressed/suicidal and the Latuda made my psychosis worse.
"I have a face washing routine at night and something for my teeth.

I also make it a goal to have a real and good conversation with someone each day"
"I have counselling again tomorrow.   I let my jealousy and paranoia cloud my judgement and did more harm than good last night. 
Today is a new day. "
I live alone and get this fear a lot. It helped a bit to get a chain lock installed on my door. Do you have any kind of cameras or security system?
I quit taking my abilify a few days ago. It caused weight gain that caused depression. If I have any psychotic symptoms I'm going back on it though.
I'd be happy to respond to your questions if you would first address the questions in my original post. Let me know if I didn't get my point across.
I'm not in school anymore. I'm a dude learning how to do adult still even tho I'm 25 lmao. Thank you tho for the advice. It still is very helpful :)
"I've done MANY bad things, similar to your desires...you know what: If they deserve it - do it, if they don't deserve it: don't do it. It's simple. "
"Idk why but I have a certain bias against therapy, or maybe it’s because I just don’t want to lose my depression since idk who I am without it. "
"Just be sure that you don't get physical when you kick her out, the last thing you want is for her to try and charge you with assault or something. "
"Maybe you have a core rational outlook, but have developed some sort of psychotic dark inner sanctum as a coping mechanism for when things go wrong?"
She makes me feel better. But as soon as she leaves it's back to square one. And we're living in different cities now so I can't be reliant on her.
"Sometimes it helps to look around for therapists. If you don't click with one, it's okay to look for another. Why isn't she much help, if I can ask?"
Take care. I am very tired from the fight now. I need to get ready for my evening and watch I Am Frankie on Nickelodeon later. :) Keep your head up!
Thanks for the advice. What makes group therapy better? Also by relationship I meant with my girlfriend but your not wrong I could improve on both.
"Thanks so much, that is really appreciated. :) Rest assured my wife has been great on the hug front, I just want to do something about this if I can"
"They sell kits to test your water for lead that might be worth looking in to. I'd consider moving in case it's supernatural, but that's just me lol."
"Well thanks for the suggestion, yet I'm a hardcore atheist + where i live (eastern corners of europe) there are no such monasteries...but 10x again!"
"Yeah I'm 16, going 17 in a month, but I heard it can develop later in life so I'm just a bit worried if they truly were early warning signs or not. "
Yeah this for sure. I consider myself very with the times but I definitely didn’t understand the gravity of OCD till I started following this sub.
"Yeeah if you don't distance yourself from stressful situations in time you'll ultimately clam-up out of defense. Hope you can have a break soon :( 
"
"Yes she's in taekwondo, twice a week. Thank you for the advice. I feel that is kinda young for meds but I don't know anything about antidepressants."
also find part 2 here interesting watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kFXYRaSr8&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kFXYRaSr8&amp;t=4s)
and... do you have one solid friend in the group that you feel closest to? maybe a one on one with that friend could be a better way to approach it?
"awwww. Don't give up, there is someone out there! Maybe try some different things and meet different kinds of people to the people you meet usually?"
"Give yourself a little grace. We’re all human. Don’t beat yourself up for how you feel or mistakes you’ve made. Be kind to yourself but tough enough to know when to push yourself.

Also don’t rely on your mental illness as an excuse. Just because you have depression or anxiety doesn’t give you or anyone else the right to be an asshole. We’re all held responsible for our actions and words. "
"Have you tried meditation and focused deep breathing? Breath deep and concentrate only on the breathing and let your thoughts clear. When you're at home you can close out your thoughts with nature sounds like rainfall or waves on the beach and let your mind slip into a more meditative state. Over time and practice, this habit could help you control your thoughts when you're out in public with friends."
"How long did you guys no contact for? if you don’t mind me asking, are you guys still together/friends or gone separate ways? 

Yes I understand, we have gone with very limited contact for the past few days (apart from me asking him questions about the incident and checking up on him since he was admitted to a mental hospital for observation for a day) and I am just aching to talk to him properly.. "
"I agree with this from the U.S. I have made several attempts to reach out to therapists and get linked with a psychiatrist and it’s like a damn circus convention. You can’t just get through in this system it feels like. I go through phases where I feel okay and not, and when I’m not feeling okay I try and reach out but the amount of effort and bullshit it takes just to get some help is asinine. "
I think your friends were more familiar with high talk while your parents took whatever weird stuff you said to be real. Leading you to the doctors and what may be a misdiagnosis because of a misunderstanding. If I were you and I wanted to properly delve back into it id do it with a friend who understands your situation and who can obverse you to see if you do actually do and say something abdnomral.
"I've heard effexor is really really hard to get off of. Also to my knowledge all antidepressants/antianxiety meds have the potential to cause all sorts of withdrawal issues from depression to hallucinations to suicidal ideation and behavior. 

Make sure to let your doctor know what happened so you can work out a safety plan and how to handle a crisis in the future. 

Sorry about your girlfriend btw :("
"I’m so sorry you have to go through this. Breakups are never easy no matter what. Do lots of self care. Spend lots of time doing things you enjoy, whatever they may be. Explore your new city. Join groups to get to know new people. Avoid alcohol and drugs because these will numb you. Maybe consider starting a journal if you don’t have one to help process what I’m sure are many different emotions?"
"Sounds bad. I have the walking on egg shell thing with my girl sometimes but that probably is more to do with my self confidence. I also have pretty shit hearing and my girl sometimes makes a joke or very rarely gets annoyed. Also I have always worried I’m very boring, so I could imagine it would be awful to be told this by your SO. Wish you the best in your next relationship bud, keep your chin up."
"Sunny, I'm so sorry to hear that you lost your best friend.  Have you been diagnosed as having general depression?  Has a psychiatrist evaluated you and prescribed an antidepressant?

I ask because, given that you now have a lot of good things going for you (including a kid you love), the most likely explanation for ""hating your life"" would seem to be a body chemical change that is causing depression."
Yea another opinion can’t hurt I suppose. I’m going to start seeing a psychiatrist instead of a psych nurse nothing against that but I think someone higher qualified is the only way to go. I literally have no clue what is wrong with me I def have anxiety and some manic tendencies and impulsiveness and erratic behavior and mood swings. I’m going for a fresh evaluation soon will see what they say.
[r/rape](https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/) might be of assistance for you. I'm sorry you had to live through this. This is absolutely not normal it's rape and abuse. You were both too young and intoxicated to consent to sex with an adult. My best advice for you is to seek counseling with someone you can trust and they should be able to help you work through what you are still going through as a result.
"I am definitely glad that I am in therapy because it will help me out in case I need to leave him. I am hoping that with him starting therapy it will help him to cope with whatever is causing all of this. I just don't want to give up on him. He has never harmed my son in any way despite him saying some hurtful things to me out of anger in the past. He gets frustrated sometimes and thanks me for being there for him, so I know he is aware that there is a problem. He also said that if it wasn't for me he wouldn't be going to therapy. I just hope that it helps. I really do love him and want him to get better. I am just having a very difficult time lately. "
"I have a daughter with a previous ex and i had to give her to him for a few months because my mental health was a complete free fall, i felt like i wasn't taking care of her the way i knew she should've been. Now i have her back, her father is broke and on the verge of jail. I'm doing the best i can for her. 

The way i see it, how can you be expected to take care of someone else if you can't even take care of yourself. Mental health is so much bigger than most people realize. 

It will get better! All you have to do is focus on what makes you happy and try to do something with it. Believe me, it sounds easier than it is, but well worth it. I promise(:"
Remember you deserve to be treated well. And what you may think is a serious offensive act may not even register as such with that person. Overthinking things is symptomatic of anxiety related disorders. But there are many little things that can be done to lessen the impact of this in your life.  It's manageable if you try not to banish any thought but recognizing it ok to feel that way even natural or normal. Ownership of emotion and action are part of understanding them. When we can understand them we can then manage them . I hope you research ownership and mindfulness because there is much that can be done. Positive regards to you in your endeavors.
"Stop! You have to stop defining yourself by what others say about you!
I am a wife and mother and daughter of an ADHD father and yes it could all be relayed to ADD. Please listen to the professional instead of your asshole mother. It's genetic and nothing to be ashamed of and it's very treatable with your psychiatrist, and you will need therapy to help you deal with your new reality.  Please take advantage of it because it's not going to be easy but if you keep caving when someone says something about you that isn't positive. 

The next thing you need to do is learn all you can about it.  Take medication when they offer it but become your own advocate."
"That's absolutely appalling. My therapist taught me to ditch the labels and how incorrect it is to box humans in like that. Working on the maladaptive behaviors is what's important. Many different ""disorders"" manifest in other ways and our life experiences can make us act out for certain periods of time. For example at one point in my life I was promiscuous, stole a lot, and developed an addiction. ""THAT'S BPD!!!!"" No. Actually. I had a really abusive home life and acted out any way I could. Guess who doesn't steal anymore, never has casual sex, and has been sober for months? This chick. Fuck those unprofessional ""doctors,"" who should lose their jobs. "
"Yes!  This right here.  My  (now ex) wife convinced me I was bipolar (she has a MS in psychology. But is not a therapist).   She even coached me as to what to say to several different therapists and psychiatrists.  Long story short,  I was actually CPTSD because of her emotional abuse and infidelity.   She is a narcissist.  I finally figured out what I was years later and am seeing a trauma therapist now.  My life had been saved and I am starting to get some semblance of a life back.  EMDR and neurofeedback.

Most psychiatrists don't understand trauma and will only consider what is in the DSM.  Bipolar and PTSD/CPTSD have a lot of overlapping symptoms."
"No problem. No joke I yelled the same thing to my counselor ""I'm tired of being the strong one!"" ""How about people take care of me for a while!"". It's not just frustrating, it kinda made me feel lonely. Like being an alpha has its benefits but it's pretty lonely at the top. Following her advice I stopped expecting people to just know and I started asking for more, to get my needs met instead of just giving giving giving. It's only logical and it's a two way street anyway. I think some of it comes of deeply either being too proud or thinking you don't deserve it, that you SHOULD be able to do it on your own so why ask....well just because you CAN do it alone doesn't mean you have to, nor it makes you weak. Well as it turns out I let myself become a bit lazier and ask for help more often. Contrary to what I thought my friends are willing to help and it gets easier to just reach out with time. Try it :)

"No, ethically any decent therapist will not see two people individually with this level of connection at the same time. Couples therapists may be an exception.

Keeping confidentiality is harder and it will mess with your mind talking about issues and wanting to know your fiances 'side' (of course the therapist would not be able to tell you what they discussed, it's more an issue for your therapy process). Have them refer you. You want a safe third party for therapy, even if your issues have nothing to do with your relationship.

Obviously most therapists have very strict ethics, but they are human, and reasons against this sort of thing are implicit bias, slip-ups in confidentiality, difficulty forming a completely open patient-therapist relationship (trying to seem better than you feel to save face with someone your fiance knows), and them having a backstory of sorts rather than coming into it fresh.
"
"What you describe is severe depression, something I experienced for nearly a year. Searching for a therapy plance and an neurologist are essential, even if it takes you a few days or week just to make a call and an appointment and even if said appointment takes months.
 What you can try to do now is (if possible) go to an doctor and ask for a blood check and vitamin checks for Vitamin D, the Vitamin B complex, blood Fe (iron) and if possible other vitamins too (though I know that even in countries like germany, it can be costy...). If you can't affort any checks, just go to a pharmacy and buy Vitamin D supplements and Fe supplements and suplements for the Vitamin B complex (if possible), ask about the dosages and daytimes you should take them and take them vor at least three weeks. It sadly takes some time before your body shows changes...

(Also I am sorry for any mistakes, I tiped it on the phone ^^"")"
"I knew I'd come off as a little arrogant, that's inevitable, but to me it's just a trait, and isn't any more important than my height or weight, for example. It's not that important to me insofar as my worth as a person, but I understand why people would see it that way.

What hurts even more is that being a teenager I'm a lot more limited than other people in my ability to help others. My plan over the summer was to get a job and donate some big portion of my income to a few causes I cared about. Unfortunately my parents pushed me into a lot of things, including a week-long trip to California, that left me without enough time to get a standing job, so that wasn't really an option for me. I wish I had more means to help other people, but at the same time I have the fear at the back of my mind that if I ever get those means I'll forget all about my good intentions and spend the money all on myself. 

I'm just really sad and angry at the world that put all this pain here and made me unable to do anything but watch.

Or maybe I haven't been looking hard enough for ways to positively contribute? I don't know. I just don't feel good about anything in general."
"This sounds like an emotional flashback and dissociation. When you are overwhelmed, you go into a dissociative state to protect yourself, as you did many times before when you were younger to protect yourself. With an emotional flashback, even though you may not feel like you are in danger now, you flashback to the times before where you were in danger.

You are not alone in this! I didn't know what an emotional flashback was. I can't always see that I am in one, because unlike a visual flashback, it is just a state of mind that is harder to recognize. I go to therapy once a week and am able to better understand what my triggers are for emotional flashbacks. My T recommends grounding techniques to help overcome an emotional flashback. Smelling essential oils like cinnamon or lemongrass. Rubbing your palms together. Wiggling your toes and moving your body to ""feel"" yourself in your current space. Therapy also helps reduce the impact of an emotional flashback over time so that in the future you are less likely to have a flashback at all even in a similar high stress moment. But when it does happen, you can also have tools to help you get back to baseline. "
"Right, and those people who make false claims, help to make me look like just another idiot trying to go shopping with my dog, which minimizes my needs. I would never want to encroach on someone unnecessarily, but it seems to me that if I have a board certified doctor claiming that my dog is for emotional support that should be equal to a dog trained in other capacities. For example, if I was required to attend an event and crowds make me go into panic attack mode, I’m far better off with my dog than my Xanax. He has far more of a calming effect on me and knows when I’m reaching my breaking point. Formally trained or not; he climbs onto my chest and licks my face when I’m sobbing, he rolls over to be scratched when I’m stressed - he reacts specifically to my emotional needs. 

Someone told me about a woman (maybe true or maybe not) who got a letter from her doctor that said she is highly allergic to dogs and cannot be on the same airplane as them no matter what. With this letter she is guaranteed an animal free flight. It is more of a hassle for businesses, but this treats everyone as equals with their individual needs. 

As I’m sure you’re already aware, we need to expand our definitions of disabilities and learn about people’s needs. I’m hoping to take diversity certification training to formally help to move corporations forward. Big companies start making changes and more will follow. "
"Also look into therapy, maybe it could help you with coping with anxiety, just need to find a chill therapist to get another opinion on these matters"
"And you sound like a judgmental creep. Why are you looking at old men's posts on Facebook, anyway?

EDIT: Accidental question mark in first sentence."
Congratulations friend. I hope things only get better for you. Thank you for posting. I know it helps me in times of struggle to see people winning.

Good news is they never lost it to begin with. Bad news is that they mutilated themselves surgically and chemically despite being perfectly healthy.
"Have you watched the vsauce video on awkwardness? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o268qbb_0BM

OP should watch it ASAP."
"How am I being paranoid right now? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. I'm only 15, shouldn't instances of self harm or suicide attempts be reported? "
I am enrolled in the VA care system. But I hadn't considered any other things beside PTSD. I didnt know if any other things cause problems like this.
I don't think it's its own condition. Could be a symptom of a condition. Could just be that you need to learn to let go of things you cannot control.

I thought of it as well but I am never impulsive. I have standards and even when I feel slightly sad I keep myself to it and when I'm happy as well.
I was on seroquel at around 300mg+ and I wasn't schizophrenic. Doses don't confirm anything other than that a dose is helping you with your symptoms.
I was. I am not anymore. You are still. YOU are the one who is sick. That's what you don't understand.  You think you are normal. You are ILLOGICAL.
"I will call my psychiatrist tomorrow or Monday, but if they cannot push my appointment within the next two weeks, I don't think I'm going to wait up."
"I'm not sure, when I've gotten little tics - they happen in silence too. I tend to do a noise from my throat that I can explain or stop sometimes lol"
"I’ve experienced dissociation and derealization, too. It can be very unsettling. I’m proud of you for taking action and making plans to get help!"
Only issue is I don't have the money. I work for a little over minimum wage and all that money goes to college. My parents are stretched thin as well
"Probably not. In my experience, Psychs tend to want to see you in person before prescribing. I could be wrong, and it doesn't hurt to ask. Good luck!"
Thanks! Helps to know others see the same thing. We even had school staff telling us they feel nervous when giving a speech...we switched schools. :)
That sounds pretty manageable.  You probably don't need therapy or medication.  I don't think you have a mental disorder from what I've heard so far.
"That's funny, I have slightly different image in my feed: [https://imgur.com/d1ntJgu](https://imgur.com/d1ntJgu).  
But I also find it very annoying."
"Therapists are trained to help people who need help, even if they aren't sure what to say.

Why not give it a try? You might be pleasantly surprised."
"This isn't unusual with a number of different mental illnesses and personality disorders. 

Have you ever been assessed and diagnosed with anything? "
"Very cool insight, thanks for sharing!
What genetic testing exactly?
I want to do Genesight soon to see what antidepressants are most suitable for me"
"You won't have suffered any significant long term effects from the risperidone, but did you ever seek a second opinion on your mental health issues? "
"You're not alone.

But, you should be diagnosed. It will help.

I, myself, have severe depression and anxiety. The pills honestly don't help, though."
"empathy = feel pain
compassion = need to help
sympathy = feel sorry for

just bc someone lacks empathy doesn't mean they lack sympathy and compassion"
"I feel as if i landed on my feet with my GP so I'm sorry that you've had it rough so far. My surgery had a mental health nurse specifically so could be an option for you if yours has one. Other than that I can echo what the other comment said of seeking Councillors/Therapy. Some charities specialise in certain age ranges (under 25 e.g.), could be worth looking into that if you fall into that category. "
"I feel you. 
Sometimes like now, I feel like the only person I got is myself. Have you told your significant other about it? I would recommend talking to him and letting him know how you feel. Maybe, one of his friends can bring over their partner and you guys can chat and see if you like them or not. But I more than certain you're going to figure this out. Have an amazing day and cheers from the USA. "
"I tend to agree with TheCrunk1. Some (NOT all) of these disorders can sometimes (not always) be actually explained by the situation a person is living in, with maybe depression and anxiety thrown in for good measure. I am not saying this is the case for you, but I would get to a Therapist or a Psychiatrist (a professional) so they can sort through it and see what your issue really is. Good luck to you!"
"Screaming is great! I do it in my car... Sometimes on the road I see other people shouting and I think, ""this guy gets it.""  We all have bad days.

People with social anxiety are generally quiet and shy. So it would make sense that we crave to make some noise of our own sometimes.

Its similar advice I'd give to someone who needs to cry. Sometimes its better just to let it out then to carry it around. "
"Then be the change young one. Someday, you will be them, saying things to people your age. Make sure you treat them with the respect you wish you had right now. A significant portion of Gen X feels millennials have entitlement issues. To me it's the difference between them having gotten little help when they were young and millenials receiving help. Your right though, being respectful isn't difficult. "
"woops. but yeah, it only intensified after i smoked weed for the first time... way beyond what a first timer should smoke. since then it’s been intensified. sometimes i go through periods where i didn’t smoke but that same feeling gets me and i can’t shake it. it’s really difficult. i don’t know if maybe it was traumatic for me and it worsened it or it just added onto my paranoia about life. "
"If you were a ""lazy prick"" then you wouldn't worry about being one. That's how those things tend to go. 

It is common for mental health issues to manifest in early adulthood. It is also very common for them to be inconsistent -- you can have a good day followed by a bad day, and good or bad weeks or even months.

If you struggle with substances particularly in the winter, you may have seasonal affective disorder or similar.

I would strongly advise going to your doctor to discuss these issues. He or she will be able to provide advice on where to go from there. 

Try to avoid self-blame. Nobody chooses to have illnesses or problems. Be kind to yourself."
I’m so incredibly glad you told your mom and she responded well. Hopefully this will begin the journey to feeling healthy again. Yeah I remember when my parents found out about the suicidal thoughts it kind of seemed like it broke them a little but it’s only because they love us so much (so I guess it’s a good thing). Yeah the whole getting help thing (for me at least) was INCREDIBLY emotionally draining; I remember staring at the wall and it being so weird because it was like everything shut off there was NOTHING. Listen to your body and be kind to yourself (that’s my therapist coming out) because you just did a great and extremely hard thing.
"TL;DR - PTSD is a physical body response to psychologically reliving the trauma. If you practice reliving the trauma in a calm body, it can help when you're triggered.

Unfortunately PTSD isn't a thing that just goes away or ""gets better"". It's a physical symptom of trauma, and appropriately processing that trauma is a key party of gaining function with it. My therapist and I focus on ""reliving"" or ""reviewing"" the trauma while my body is calm in order to remove the physical PTSD response each time I think about it. It's really tricky to stay calm and takes a lot of body awareness. Sometimes I think I'm calm in a session and my therapist will stop me and I realise that my legs are tense or that my face is tense and then I can relax and keep describing my trauma. It's helped me emotionally and physically and I've regained the ability to function on winter roads and will someday soon be able to drive again!"
"Yes you did the right thing. You will see this time will pass, you will take a job that better suits you, and move on from this. No one should stay trapped.  It’s a scary place to be and when it comes to work, you can make a change.
I was in a terrible place with a job probably 10 years ago. I finally had to quit because I was so unhappy, anxious, and depressed about going in day to day. I had planned to take any job I needed to take (coffee shop, dog walker,etc) but I ended up going back to school (at nights) working at a school during the day so I could do my student teaching and am now a teacher. It wasn’t pleasant, I still wish I didn’t have to go through it, but it kept me moving towards a happier place. You got this. Take a break, rest, recuperate, take a “just getting by” job if you have to but move forward and don’t stay in a place that’s hurting you. You deserve better. We all do. "
"Major props to you too. This sounds like you are very empathetic to these poor animals, and honestly, I don't know if I would be able to do that job because my first instinct would be to hug every single animal and bring them home with me. I have a soft spot in my heart for animals (and children). It must be so hard to watch their suffering and not be able to do much for them. Just know that you are doing a good thing, whether you can see it or not. This is a hard question to answer because the first thought that came to my mind was please take care of yourself first and if this is causing such stress then maybe it's not the place you need to be right now. I have a hard time writing that because I understand how you feel too--you want to help the animals. Can you see a lot of yourself in these animals? I know I do when I go to an animal shelter. I see the abandoned (I was emotionally abandoned by a mother who was actually TOO protective--she didn't take time to actually nurture me properly as she was trying to protect me, if that makes sense) and abused (was bullied and physically attacked many times growing up) and the unwanted (I felt like this because my mom preferred my brother over myself, or so I thought) and I see the reflection of myself in their eyes. Do what is best for you. Maybe you can get to a better place, then you can help the animals better because you will be better.  


Just a thought..."
"You actually never mentioned in your OP that the person asked you directly about your mental health issues or that the questioning was a result of a panic attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even so, I would call it a huge stretch to label it discrimination, I would wager that a manger would tell you to not talk about lots of things in the workplace. Is the manager in question aware that you had a panic attack? If they're not then they haven't breached their duty of care and more-so cannot be held accountable for an issue that you haven't told the company about. If the company is informed then they can deal with any issues that you may face while you work, failing to flag up a concern you have relating to your condition absolves them from any Duty of Care since they can't help with what they don't know about.

&amp;#x200B;

You've also got to consider that many managers hear this kind of stuff all the time (I am in no way saying that you are making this up but sadly people do make these things up for attention / days off) and as such become very jaded about it all. I once worked with a young girl that said she suffered from Anxiety, everyone started noticing that it only ever played up when we needed to work late, long story short, all our higher-ups developed a ""If you don't have your issues flagged in your medical records or via the mental health dept. then you don't have one"". Companies need to bat very carefully around the subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speak to the manager in question privately and allow him to direct you through the correct channels to resolve your concerns. They should be able to provide you with a person that is trained to deal with such situations. "
"If that what the clinic did then they are fucking assholes and wanting to stay away from them is perfectly reasonable. Free clinics deal with a huge amount of people and don't really see the individual. I am not defending them, as it can get extremely frustrating when they don't listen, but that is the unfortunate situation. While it is more expensive, you can develop a relationship with a therapist in a private practice. And if you don't like them, then you leave and go find someone you click with. 

I can't really relate to your situation, my parents are both healthcare professionals and I have not had any bad experiences with my therapists so I have a bias unfortunately. My parents have told me that the healthcare system is deteriorating and becoming more corporate in some areas so what you are feeling is valid. 

You say that therapy is about taking care of what you want to take care of, which it is I totally agree, but the doctor is the one who is trained in how to help you, and the proper way to recover is not always what you expect or want to do. There are some aspects of mental health recovery that are down right counter-intuitive. 

Abusive people are terrible people, they are narcissistic and uncaring and hurt those around them, and a good therapist will see that. I have had to deal with one before, he abused my now ex and I wanted to do nothing but rip his throat out when I found out. When I have spoken to therapists they have not tried to defend him, they understand what an asshole he is, but they have not tried to antagonize him either, because their focus should be on YOU, and YOUR recovery, not go on a hate crusade against those who have harmed you. A good therapist will give  you tools to rise above you troubles, a bad or inept one would not and tbh should not be in the industry . A good therapist would also be able to work with you financially, as their primary focus if you, not your money. "
Alright well that's fine I guess. I really hope that you can find something to get you through this. Dealing with this kinda stuff can be a nightmare.

"For *what* scenario? If you're not immediately suicidal, they'll just recommend you speak with a therapist, which is exactly what BH means to provide."
Having multiple mental health disorders is actually pretty common. Don’t worry about it; I don’t think anyone will think you’re “two-faced.”
He is exhibiting personality disorder symptoms. Healthy people don't abuse others. But it's true that a personality disorder doesn't make abuse okay.

I’ve sometimes had the same thought. Thanks for posting this. Now I know I’m not the only one. I’ve never told another soul about it until now.

Or maybe you can start seeing a therapist and explain your situation to them so you can get the tools you'd need to help her get into therapy herself

"Sociopath isn’t a diagnosis, it’s an insult. And it’s really disturbing that you would post to a mental health forum with this kind of nonsense."
"There are free clinics you can go to, or you can ask any therapist if they will work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based."
"They shouldn’t check, no. I’ve always marked “no” on the do you have mental illnesses part of applications. I’ve never had an issue with it!"
They've already figured out you have no idea what you're talking about.  It doesn't make your insults or half-assed justifications hurt them any less.
"This is one heck of a good question. I have no clue on what this could be, but I am sure someone here might know the answer to this. Good luck to you!"
This sounds like fairly strong anxiety. Have you talked to a doctor about this or can you get any professional help to get you started on managing it?
Yeah just posting about it on Reddit makes me feel better. It’s hard for me to talk about stuff like this. Thank you for your reply it means a lot.
"Yeah, you’re probably right. But my depression causes me to not get hungry or thirsty which causes me to get depressed, so how do I break the cycle?"
"Yes, thank you. I am currently without a family doctor- which is why I haven't been properly diagnosed and why I want to hear what others go through. "

"I wonder if i had this disease..? I used to imagine people all around me.. 

Video game characters,classmates,friends.

I couldnt sit down for example because i saw someone else there,i was imaginating it,but in reality no one was there. No one.

My imagination was so strong..
It REALLY bothered me in other things,but in the last few years,it has started to bother me less. Way less.

And thats not all.."
"I'd loose the focus on her looks altogether. Simple 'you're beautiful' is enough. No more focus on the body, muscles, fat, diets, try and loosen up about working out especially around her. Ask her what it is that is bothering her and making her want to look completely different?

Is she using apps alot and getting negative ideas from instagram or media? Try and point out that media ideals are damaging. "
"Really? What else can I try? I've looked into it quite a bit and the only other thing seems to be train beheading, and I don't know of any in my area. I don't have access to a gun and jumping off heights doesn't sound great since it may just paralyze me. Hanging isn't an option unless I go somewhere as well, and it's hard to secure a rope via nail or something to a roof to hold an entire human's weight."
"Technically it is “all in your head”. The only thing is that your brain, the most complex and misunderstood organ known to science, is “in your head”. When something is wrong with your heart or pancreas, nobody tells you that “it’s all in your thoracic cavity”, so why should they dismiss mental health issues as anything other than a misfunction of the brain? 

It doesn’t make any sense. "
"This reminds me of something I’ve seen around exercise and practicing music but I think it applies universally.

The quote is something like “10 minutes is still better than 0 minutes.” It’s just a reminder that even if you’re only able to get out 10 minutes of work, exercise, etc it’s better than nothing. That and keeping in mind that consistency is key I think are good things to remember. "
"This. You shouldn't change yet. Therapy is also about learning to properly communicate how you feel and understand yourself better. Changing therapist wouldn't be helpful, but talking about how you feel definetly will. It can be extremely therapeutic for you! And as said above, the problem clearly isn't really her age, it's more how you feel about yourself, and changing your therapist won't change that."
"Your counsellor is there for more than just one thing you're struggling with, I would suggest telling them about what's going on with you right now and if they can't handle it or you don't trust that they won't judge you then maybe it's time for a new counsellor. I would say be kinder to yourself, the fact that your in counselling shows that you're trying and to me that shows alot of personal strength. "
"&gt; I try to employ it when I’m feeling anxious, paranoid etc. but I really don’t feel like it works for me at all. 

This is a common mistake that I've made myself many times. I get into a mode where doing it when I feel fine starts to feel like a ""waste of time"" and I feel like I ""have it down"" so I can just use it when I need it.

It doesn't work that way.

My therapist describes the situation with this analogy: ""You don't just start lifting weights on the day of the big game.""

Mindfulness is a practice, and ""practice"" is the key word. It can help almost everyone, but you have to do it regularly and be patient.

Hope it works for you eventually!"
"I honestly don't have much advice to give, because i have some of the same problems. (Not all of them). I am in the states and can't afford health insurance, so all of my mental health problems are being untreated. 
To be completely honest, marijuana helps me sometimes. It's the only thing that makes me feel the need to eat. And a lot of times, like today, helps me when i have a short temper. I don't know what your locations laws are, and whether or not you'd do it regardless. I'm not by any means saying it's a cure all, some people don't tolerate it and you should still get help even if you do try it. 
I could use it, too. 
I wish you the best of luck. "
"I was in a toxic relationship for almost 7 years and was absolutely in love with him. There were a couple red flags early on that I chose to ignore. Those issues only got worse over time. 

I started dating him when I was 21 and ended it when I was 28. We had broken up after 2 years but got back together. We broke up for the same reason both times. I wasted 5 more years with him. It took me another 4 years to stop thinking about him. I wasted my 20's on that dirtbag.

Be happy that you only spent 2 years with her. You are now better equipped for your next relationship.  You now know more of what you want and need.

"I've ghosted my therapist after seeing them for half a year. We didn't click, I wasn't getting anything out of our sessions, so I just stopped going/ making appointments. It definitely wasn't the best way to handle the situation. (I tried to tell her a few times in person &amp; tried to call a few times, but I have really bad anxiety and I just couldn't, I felt like she would be offended or something and I couldn't handle that) I ran into her again in public 2 months later and she wasn't offended or mad - she was very understanding &amp; just wished I told her. She was also very worried. Moral of the story: don't ghost your therapist, just tell them haha"
"Only a mental health professional can diagnose and offer treatment. I strongly suggest, if these issues are troubling to you, that you ask your mother to get an appointment for you.  This is important for YOU to know  and to ensure your early treatment IF you have an illness, disorder, or therapy issue. 

I hope you ask your parent to make you an appointment. This is the only means to gain answers to this question. You are intelligent (indicated by your writings above); therefore seek your answers from a professional. Then you can know and use this sub to discuss your issues.   I wish you well, young intelligent people are our future. Take care of you.  "
"Some people just can't see outside of themselves enough to realise that not violating somebody's trust and privacy is more important than boosting their own ego by showing people that they have some exciting secret to share.

Don't worry about these people. They're not necessarily bad people, but they are ignorant, selfish, and untrustworthy. Pick yourself up from this and strike this person off of your list of confidants.

I'm sorry that you had to deal with this crap. It's never fun, but try to remember that, to other people at work, that bit of gossip was just one small thing in the millions of other things going on in their lives, so it'll wash over."
"Its the other way around. 

No one can tell you if its 'bad' enough to 'seek help'

Only you can know what toll your the state of your mental health is taking on your life. Only you can decide the cost benefit analysis of whether the discomfort/distress merits your action and expenditure of energy/time to get well. 

Some people would consider any toll whatsoever, reason to get help. Others will try and live with the symptoms and 'tough it out'. Personally I agree with the former position, because I lived the latter and it did me harm. 

A therapist should be able to help you figure out if therapy is right for you within a few sessions. It would definitely prove a starting point to figuring this stuff out. Spending time with other people who experience depression and/or anxiety could also help you put what you are experiencing in some kind of perspective, and help yuo make sense of how you feel about it. "
"My therapist is only 5 months older than me and we’re 28. I had the same problem you did. I guess I just had to come to terms with the fact that other people my age are out there killing it and I’m living at home again and only halfway through my undergrad (and I’m aiming for my masters... yeah, I have a long way to go lol). Anyways, therapists come a dime a dozen. 

Maybe she’s just not the right one for you? I’ve had to go through a few therapists to find one that I genuinely like as far as their views and practices go. It’s all just a part of the process, and if she’s the mature professional she should be, she shouldn’t take it personally at all (one of mine did, but she was a lazy therapist and I told her why I left and didn’t really much care if it hurt her feelings. I’ve had a few friends who saw her as well and they validated my feelings that she’s just not a good therapist). "
"You're being hard on yourself. It's easy for little gestures of good you do to seem unimportant but I'm sure you've had impact on people in ways you don't realize. It's not the right season, but the classic Christmas movie 'It's A Wonderful Life' might be a motivational thing to watch. Maybe what you need is more people actively showing you how important you are to them. Sadly, as a society we don't usually give deep meaningful thanks to each other so you may have to initiate the dialogue. For example, at work, ask a manager what good things you've done on the job so you can continue to do them. Ask your friends what they enjoy the most about hanging out with you. Ask your siblings if they ever learned something from you while growing up or what their favourite memory is of you all together as a family. It's okay to need validation sometimes and it shows you really care about how you impact other people. "
"It's been a little while since I've updated, been trying to quit smoking. Went 3 days and bought a pack. I am so disappointed in myself. But I'll continue working on it. I have a date tonight with a man I had really enjoyed spending time with. It's been a while since we have really spoken or hung out. I was going through a hard time after a traumatic incident in June and I pushed him away. I'm getting better slowly and his ex wife has finally moved out, house is finally on the market. Now we both have time to spend with each other. The question is, can he accept me on my bad days? There will be more. Is the connection still there? I guess I'll find out tonight. He was the only.man I could trust to be close to after what happened. But he's made plans to see me about 3-4 times and then something came up. I was thinking yesterday about how I need someone consistent in my life and he hasn't been. That makes trust a little difficult. Later last night it's as if he were reading my mind. He apologized for not being consistent though I have been and because of this he can't get me out of his mind. He can't stop thinking about me. What are your thoughts on on this?"
"What /u/WhatAmI71 means is probably Cotard delusion, also referred to as ""Walking Corpse Syndrome"" because people think they are already dead, or maybe Capgras delusion, when you're thinking that various people in your life have been replaced by identical-looking impostors (but usually not yourself). However, psychotic symptoms can also be a sign towards schizophrenia or even ""mere"" depression, too, or trauma (as you describe their home as being potentially problematic). It is hard (and frankly not advisable) to diagnose people via a couple of sentences on the internet, but to answer your question: yes, this definitely is something that can occur, and it can most probably be treated. However, your friend needs to see a professional for this in order to get a proper diagnosis and start treatment, possibly with medication as well as is often the case with psychotic episodes/symptoms, especially if they have been present for years as you say, and look into possible physical causes too.Maybe showing them that you care and reassuring them that is treatable could change their mind, maybe you coud offer to go to the therapist with them? Nobody can force them to go through with anything they don't want to, so listening to what they have to say can't really do too much harm. I don't really know what else to advice besides seeing a professional, because these things really just don't go away by themselves miraculously, they are suffering, they are suicidal, they need and deserve help and they have people like you who care. I hope it works out for them in the end. Good luck.  


edit: decided to emphasize I'm **not** diagnosing your friend with Cotard/Capgras delusion or schizophrenia or anything else for that matter, just listed to illustrate that psychotic symptoms in general and also more specifically towards what your friend describes do occur in various contexts and need to be examined further in order to be sure.

"No health insurance? In the USA? There is a heavy tax penalty for not having health insurance so most likely yyour family does have it. But several insurances don't cover mental health.

I can't give in to it when they are around, lest they pick up a habit I would rather them NOT have.

"You really need to be under the care of a mental health professional. Try to find a doctor who charges on a sliding scale. Contact a mental health crisis center in your area. Talk to your parents about your symptoms if you can. In the meantime, decrease the demands on yourself as much as possible. Keep stress to a minimum. Take good care of yourself. Get enough sleep every night if you can and eat well. "
"I think about this often. One thing that may help the general population would be a PSA program, viral marketing, something to educate them about the risks, symptoms, and statistics about various mental illnesses. These could be placed in public, online, social media etc. 

Another way I feel we could help reshape the landscape of how mental health is viewed is by changing the language we use to define the terms. Depression could be replaced with something like serotonin associated deficiency syndrome (SADS). I really don’t know though to be honest, I just hope we are able to bring attention to this area of health that is often neglected/under studied. "
"I would recommend looking into DBT. If you don't have the resources, time, or energy to take part in a DBT program, there are workbooks that you can buy on Amazon that you can work on yourself. DBT teaches you skills that help you manage intense emotions, how to be effective in interpersonal situations and strengthen relationships, how to manage your distress, how to use mindfulness to put space between your reactions and your actions, and how to build self-acceptance and self-respect. I found it very helpful in reducing the amount and intensity in which I lash out at others. If you have any questions or want some book recommendations please let me know! "
"I’m so sorry for whatever happened to you to give you this opinion. I can tell you that there are some kids who need help. There are some kids who are complicated. Sometimes they don’t have a safe home, or they are bullied in school, or they have a learning disability, or they are socially isolated. 
And sometimes they have chemical imbalances that necessitate medication just so they can function. 
I will agree that therapy can solve a lot and addressing the entire family is hugely important. I also agree that many people (not just kids) in our society are over-medicated. But to say that it should be made illegal to treat those who need it... no way. "
"Not that it really matters but my psych is a professor at Harvard and explained in detail all the potential risks but in the end when I asked her what she would do if she were me... she said no question I would stay on an SSRI. So I did. From what I remember she felt the only reason one SSRI was preferable to another during preg had to do with pregnant subject sample sizes during studies through the FDA.  For example if a study is done and 10 pregnant women are enrolled but then for whatever reason drop out of the study, that med may not have a large enough sample size to be approved for preg women. And no I didn’t feel anything during the cross taper. "
"Can you get someone he respects to come and talk to him?  Maybe more than one person?  Some kind of intervention might help him to see the reality of what killing himself would actually mean to everyone. The more people, the better. Are all the important people in his life aware he's suicidal?   If they don't, they should. They can't help if they don't know. Put them in the loop and tell them how serious the situation is. Put to them what needs to happen. Don't waste any time. What he's doing is serious.

Your only other option would be to get him to a doctor or hospital and get him sectioned. This is certainly worth keeping as an option, (it may become necessary), but maybe try to get his people directly involved first?

One of the things that happens when you get that suicidal, is it all starts to look very reasonable. You start pushing people away, and resenting anyone who gets in your way. They become inveniences to you, not people in their own right (because everything is focused on stopping the misery)

What has to happen is he needs to - forceby if necessary - look at the external reality - what it will actually do to the others he cares about. 

Getting him out of his own  head, and thinking about other people, their feelings, their lives, hearing from them what his death will mean for them, is what he needs to get exposure to right now.

Source: been there. Got help. Glad I didn't do it.

Good luck."
"First of all - super normal. Give yourself credit where it’s due. You’re being self aware instead of denying its existence.

I try not to think of it as “combatting” your self hatred because then your psyche will get defensive (at least that’s how my brain works). What I like to do is instead focus my anxiety and hatred away from myself in a positive way with gratitude.

Hatred Ex - “I’m so stupid, I forgot to mention...blah blah blah”

Better way Ex - “Thank you for your patience, I forgot to mention...”

In my case, I started with the words “I’m sorry”. For me they were the start and end of every sentence because I felt so guilty to be alive. I recognized the negativity surrounding those words, and started to try and replace them. It’s taken me a few years, but I think I’m a lot better than I was. Listen to yourself for a few days and really think about what you’re saying and why. Start with the most negative-impacting words and try to change them into something that has positive connotation. It’ll feel really fake and like dirt in your mouth for a while, but eventually you’ll get it.

Additionally, your mental illnesses do not define you, they are a part of you. By knowing they exist and what makes them better or worse, you’re starting the process of accepting yourself as you are. That’s the real key to letting yourself succeed. You’re great, we all think so!!! Xx"
"I found myself in the same situation as you. It is common for a lot of people to not take Psychiatric disorders seriously because it's not something that you can visibly see like with physical disorders. 

Bringing it up to your mother seems like it will bring about more conflict and distress for you. You need to guage wether she is willin to understand you, or if she's just being ignorant (frankly). You guys can go to a doctor's appointment and request to speak to the doctor in private. You can request that the physician reccomend a therapist that is not religious (you can go into more detail of what you are looking for in a therapist). The pysician should point you towards various options that match your criteria.

You can also research therapists that are local to you, and they should have descriptions of what they specialize in in their bios. I found an awesome therapist that worked with gay people and did not focus on religion this way.

The most successful treatment involves therapy + medication. I only did therapy because I was afraid of medication, and treatment worked until i stopped going to therapy (financial issues). I'm in my psyciatric rotation of nursing school and by learning about the medications in depth I'm willing to try it out. 

I hope this is of some help. I know i didnt answer your question directly, but I just wanted to give you some helpful information that may also help. good luck!"
"Really?  I can't imagine that if a first responder approached me while I'm just sitting there, dissociating, and not bothering a soul, that they'd tase me.  If that's the case, then maybe I shouldn't ever go out in public?  Yikes.

Honestly, the entire internet could be deemed a cesspool - it's like any other part of society - one just has to use discretion and weed through the bad to find the good.  I feel I have a fairly solid head on my shoulders (all things considered) so I think it'll be ok.  I have never ever heard any professional tell me, anybody else, or even mention in a general manner that folks with mental health should avoid social media.  I have actually found social media quite helpful at times - where else can I go and have a 100% chance of finding another human to talk to who is awake at 3AM when PTSD is having a go at me and I just need to talk to someone, even if the conversation is mundane and about the weather in Christchurch, NZ.  

I didn't pose my question in an attempt to seek certified advice from professionals...?  I just thought that it would be intriguing to hear input ""from the other side of the fence"", so to say.  The point of my post was to ask for opinions.  I don't care if they're subjective - that's the nature of opinions.  I'm asking people for thoughts on mental health medical alert bracelets, not whether I should call emergency services or something when I'm symptomatic."
"Hi dear one. Your diagnoses does not define you nor your worth. In fact, dear, I want to encourage you that one label doesn't define your capabilities, your gifts that God the Father has given you, and all the wonderful things that make you, uniquely you.

In fact, when I was an undergraduate student in University, we watched a video about diagnosing, and how mental health workers can put a label on anything. Much like how we can self diagnose ourselves via the Internet from our symptoms, we can also diagnose and put a label on someone simply because we want to put a label.

But dear one, God doesn't see you as any less. You are made in His image. When He created you, He didn't make no mistake. Yes, we have all fallen short of the glory of God, we all have faults, things that make us imperfect, but know that no one is perfect. We all have flaws, even if some other human seems to be perfect, they're not. We all have our different battles, but your label does not mean you are not your hobbies, skills, abilities, potentials, and every single thing that makes you who you are. I truly and strongly believe that you have a calling on your life that is uniquely created by God.

I know dear that you feel heartbroken, but rest assured that you are more than the labels. You are more than a conquerer because God is with you, He loves you, and your identity lies not in your diagnoses but in Him and His love for you alone.

You are so beyond worthy of God's love. His love for you is unconditonal, dear. Seek Him and ye shall find how He can set you free and allow you to see yourself in the way He sees you, beloved.

God bless you, dear. My thoughts and prayers are with you."
"&gt; how much of a life do you have outside of that eg codependency for feeling purpose?

Not much to be honest so I think you may be on to something.

I hope you feel better. Sending lots of love your way."
"I have schizophrenia too. It sounds like you're experiencing some form of psychosis. You should tell your doctor what's going on. 

Are you taking meds?"
I really should have said that in my comment - thanks for picking up my slack. What you say is very true. Was a bit sleepy when I wrote that last night.
I thought I was the only one! I use to be more clever before I went through a bad breakup. Oh shit. Is this permanent? This has been going on for years.
"I will try this, thank you. Any recommendations on how to figure out the carbs in my cafeteria food? They don't have anything posted. Do you use an app?"
I'm taking a mood stabilizer and two anti depressants. I'm doing well on them and has helped my mood greatly. I still find myself being able to be happy

When I was first prescribed Prozac it turned my depression into suicidal depression. I'm not an expert but that was my experience. Talk to your doctor.
You're so tough with your keyboard all alone.   I'm sure it was her devil magic that convinced the kids you were a peice of shit and not your behavior.
Apparently his parents died in a car crash. His family is from another country though and I actually know very little about them. They were apparently very religious though. They would take his pokemon cards away because apparently it was the devils work or something. Drawing crosses on his head with olive oil to cleanse him or something of the sort. I honestly dont remember fully. And ill look into BPD.
"Congrats to you as well! It's complicated because I could definitely see some of the anxiety symptoms worsening after not drinking, but most of these have been symptoms of mine since I was a teenager, before I even starting heavily drinking. They seem to be somewhat subdued when I was drinking heavily but I think that's just me not being capable of understanding what's going on with my mind in that state."
"Did you get the name of the person who booked your appointment? I’d take this up to the management if I were you, ask for the manager or boss. You’re already not feeling too well emotionally and this isn’t helpful. They should be extra sensitive at places like this. Take this up to the therapist as well. If this attitude continues, I’d suggest a change of therapist. You’re the client after all. "
"If its not for you, its not. Obviously, the stresses of a normal college experience can play havoc with even a together person, but you have diagnosed issues that you need to work on. 

I suggest finding a way to withdraw from college courses, and get onto some sort of subsidy for awhile while you work on yourself.

Perhaps you can find a therapist who you can bounce other ideas for work and life off of. "
"Is that an issue for you? I mean if you don't mind that you are like that then it's fine. Everyone is different. If you don't feel comfortable about it you can try to find a therapist that helps you to explore yourself.

Dramatic events like a car crash can traumatize people even if they seem okay at first. It is usually a good idea to see a therapist to make sure it doesn't develop into a serious trauma."
"No matter if you do everything right all the time or everything wrong all the time there will always be negative folks that don't like what you do. Ultimately it's your choice. So importantly, try to make healthy decisions for your own life. You're the one who will deal with the consequences of these decisions. Right or wrong-- own what you do and have confidence in your self.  I wish you positive regard."
"No, you can look the term up on Google, and it'll explain it better than I can.

In essence, it's depression with agitation. For example, you walk around a lot restlessly, or your thoughts race, but you also feel like it's difficult to feel rewarded by life or difficult to feel anything at all. You're also very irritable and snap at people easily. All of which I've been experiencing over the past 7 years."
"She said that I have been constantly dragging her down, and that she didn’t have time to help me because she had other things going on. Since then she blocked me on Facebook, and she blocked my number from calling her. We used to like brother and sister. I don’t understand what I did wrong. I only wanted someone to confide in. We have always been there for each other in the past. It just really hurt. "
Sounds like fear of failure. They want to do the work without the burden of being responsible if things go wrong. It's a common thing for people to feel and takes them going out of their comfort zone to push themselves to shoulder responsibility and building up their self esteem so they can handle the failures alongside their successes. You're a good friend to want to help and go to this effort for them.
"Thank you. I hope you can figure it out and find peace. :)

Don't try to think on it too much. Sometimes, I let my mind go and wander, and sometimes the answer to a question or a problem will just come to me. I guess it is almost like meditation, if you are familiar with that, but not so new-agey (though I am quite a hippie in real life and wouldn't hurt a fly---literally). :) Peace and love to you. &lt;3"
"What would I say? 
Talk about what? That I am a freak who only wants to start fires all day long? 

I'm not being nasty really...I just can't talk to anyone. I have a Psych appt in a few weeks and she will bring it up but I dread being called that

"Yeah I know it man, ghosting is a cruel cruel thing. It is more likely that you just haven’t met the right kind of girl yet than it is you are too clingy. 
I have never quite understood why clingy seems to be thrown around every time someone actually shows interest. The same people who would say they believe in soul mates and love at first sight are the ones who complain about new partners being clingy."
"You are definitely not alone. I don't see physical things but I also feel like im being watched every second of my life. One place I lived at, there was actually a spirit that was always around which was probably watching me. I didn't know about them until 3 years into living there. It was really annoying because it whispered and dropped things. It wasn't in my head because it stopped when we moved away. "
"Thank you!!! 

Sadly, the people I’m referring to are family members and removing them at this point in time isn’t exactly possible. 

When I’m alone and going about my day I feel like I’m in an okay place... I’m being healthy, making better life choices, trying to get my life on track and feel like I’m making progress....

When I’m around these certain family members I feel anxious, I feel hopeless, like everything I’m doing and have done up to this point is a complete waste, like I’m crazy and something is wrong with me....

But then I question how I was able to feel none of those things before I interacted with these family members... "
"No seriously, why? How much are they paying you? 13 hour shifts? Benefits? What about overtime? Are both businesses owned by the same person/people... it's actually two completely different businesses by different people and you're not actually dumping 60 hours that's being intentionally split into 40 and 20? Have you checked your state law about mandated breaks every X hours? Seriously, research the shit out of it to see if you're getting taken advantage of or not. That's what you need to have knowledge of going into your 20's and 30's.

Even if you had good coping habits, you're still going to have a shitty time working more than 40 hours per week. Protip: NEVER EVER compromise your sleep for a little more freetime. It's not worth it.

Hit up personal finance and such, see if you really need to be working more than 40 hours.

If you can, use audiobooks. Great way to get some entertainment in your workday."

"Can you describe what you mean? I can tell.youwhat I do to not completely loose it...

Check out the sub for maladaptive daydreaming. It’s not a disorder exactly (though it may someday be classified as one) but it’s a symptom of others.
"Congrats. Even when a job is bad it is hard to pull the plug sometimes, it takes real guts to make a change and you should give yourself credit for that."
"Determine what it is specifically that you want or don't want, and let them know. If you don't know what you want, you'll never find a good professional."
"Exactly. It's not a symptom of anything. It just is. I mean maybe for some people it is a symptom of something but for normal, everyday people, it's not."

I have no idea why. But he’s abusive. I don’t see any reason to sympathize with that. He needs to help himself. You can’t force someone to change.

Yeah my gf says the same, it is hard. :("
I’m sure you’re aware of not causing harm to yourself and others with fire. It’s a disorder so you can’t blame yourself. Have you tried therapy?
"My niece was a CNA once at an assisted-living facility.  They had alarms on all the door, just in case one of the residents, headed for the exits.  LOL! "

"Psychology today.com and use the find a therapist link. That can get you started, but it does take time and research to find the right therapist for you."
Really I just wanted to know if anything I mentioned is actually worth getting looked at or if it’s mostly stuff I should be able to handle on my own.

"&gt; SSRI’s would be taking away the suicidal thoughts if it was depression

Where did you find this piece of information?  That isn't true in the slightest.  Some people are helped by SSRIs, but some aren't, even if they have depression.  If you try three different antidepressants and they don't work for you, then they call it 'treatment resistant depression.'  SSRIs aren't a litmus test for depression."
"After you’ve been on it for so long, your body has to make the changes that will occur but it will happen slowly. Honestly, I’d probably report him because tapering off can be so dangerous. I remember running out and I became very suicidal over just a couple of days. 

Is there a clinic you can go to? Or can you call and speak to a covering doctor when he’s not there? A second opinion seems valuable."
"I also grew up in an amusive household.  If you can, just start reaching out. Make. Little stand here and there. She can get angry and you can also deal with that. She's controlling you with her emotions and if you stay scared, she will continue to control you.

I hope you can stay safe and maybe make a plan to get out. Help will come if you need it but maybe you can find the strength to do it yourself. I "
"I finally found my place a year ago, aged 34. Don't give up. Think hard about what you want to do, then work toward those goals. It took me years to work up to where I am now, and there were so many setbacks and moments where I was ready to quit once and for all. Please don't give up, I have faith in you. Maybe you need some time out for a while to focus on yourself and what you want from life.

Take care."
"I have this issue too. I will never understand it, I lie about the dumbest things for no reason and i honestly can’t help it. Then later when i try to remember what actually happened in the situations i’ve lied about it’s a mess of stories blended together and i don’t know the truth. I’m trying to focus really hard on what I’m saying and thinking before i say things and I think it’s helping. "
"I know how you feel with your situation, I’ve had the same.. I had to resort to mental health section! I work on ships and rigs and heart was in my mouth.. luckily after a 3 day stay in a secure unit he started to straighten out, alcohol was the catalyst. He’s now well and back to work. Involving professionals may be a good idea! Also if you need a vent give me a shout, it’s a hard thing to process. "
"I know this might not be the most reassuring thing, but memory loss and mental health are linked. Either your brain simply isn't moving memories from short to long term memory or it is doing its best to protect you from pain, people often end up suppressing painful memories. Yeah your brain has kinda got your back.

I would get the passing out looked at though, but I know how hard going to see a doctor is "
"I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia by a psychiatrist. I made an appointment with my GP and she referred me to him. It took about six months to get a diagnosis - before that, my paperwork all said ""Psychosis NOS"" or ""Psychotic Disorder."" 

You'll also get a diagnosis upon discharge if you end up in the hospital, but that's obviously not a recommended route unless you really have to go there.

Good luck!"
"I’m not advising anyone to do anything. It’s up to the individual. 

Lots of people take anti anxiety medications solely to help them stay slightly more comfortable during therapy since lots of difficult topics come up, and I don’t do that, but I don’t have to challenge myself in every way. I chose someone I’m inclined to be more comfortable with while I talk about extremely uncomfortable things."
"Schizotypal disorder here. I found that anti-psychotics help me with delusions. I don't think I've had bad,long delusions since I started my meds. And my paranoia is much better too. So the meds have helped  me a lot. I'm on Abilify currently.

I think you should bring this up with your doctor and say you want help with the delusions. Ask him about anti-psychotics. Tell him you're worried about your life. "
"When I get too tired or just really stressed out, I hallucinate. Usually it's animals or shapes that aren't there, often in the peripherals of my vision. Sometimes they stay a little bit depending how stressed I am, but usually they don't. 

I'd still say to keep telling your GP about it or seek a second opinion. As others have said, it could just be stress or maybe it's a tumor. Likely just stress though."
"Yeah...I always associate the Fall with a certain song, and it makes me melancholy. I get ya. High school was probably the worst time in my life too (bullied, shamed, and alienated because I was and still am ""different"") and anytime I hear my graduating class song (Come Sail Away), I get the weirdest feeling of reminiscing and all the hurt comes back from those years. Is that something like you experience?"
"Yeah...it is listed under Impulse Control Disorder, but it is related to OCD very closely. It is called (UGH I can't believe I have to write it...I HATE this word) pyromania, and I have been diagnosed already. I am just waiting to see the Therapist now. -_- I really hate this stupid thing most times. If you want details on my shit days, just message me. I don't really feel like talking about it much. &lt;3"
"Your mom sounds like an extremely toxic person then. I'm not sure how old you are but you need to get away from her as soon as possible. You can still love somebody who's toxic but you also have to realize when somebody's bad for you. She needs to wrap her head around the fact that you're struggling and need proper help.

And also, remember that you can always talk on here. So don't be afraid to reach out."
"I appreciate how much you're trying to help me man but this really wasn't what the post was about. It was more for suggestions as to what I can do to dampen the boredom within the next two weeks and maybe change the mood of the situation a bit. Like I said in another comment, I don't particularly want to commit suicide, it's just the last resort I'm finally at after I feel like I've tried everything I can. I don't feel bad at all, I feel fine. This just feels like a decision like any other.  


We just see it differently. I'm sorry, I know it sounds like I'm being difficult but I'm just being honest about how I see the situation. I really do appreciate it. "
"I can see that. I find as I get older being among those who are loving are not enough because I’m still broken inside. I’m still stuck with me whether they’re there or not. They’re the ones that don’t suffer and they shouldn’t suffer from my stuff.  

I can’t isolate myself with only people that love and care about me. It’s nice that they’re understanding Of who I am and how I suffered, but I owe it to them to at least try to get better. It’s difficult for family to cope when their loved one doesn’t  believe they’ll get better. 

If therapy doesn’t work, at least you can say you are doing everything in your power to help yourself. "
"My father is doing a similar thing, he is in his 50's now and I've tried to forgive him and rebuild the relationship, but he seems to have taken this to mean that everything is peachy and I'm ok, but I'm really just trying to be polite and I'm still furious at him. Recently he moved out of the house he lived in for about 18 years, and was acting like I would be sad to see the place go, but it was where I first started burning myself at night because I couldn't sleep because of racing thoughts and untreated anxiety. It's just so unfair that they get to put this heavy burden on us and then they are able to shrug off the guilt of it like nothing ever happened."
"No, it's meant to eliminate ones which they test for and your genes indicate you'd likely have more side effects due to the way you metabolize the medication. I've thought of doing the same and spoke with my doctor about them. His feelings were that while it may be helpful for some doctors who dont know the medication they are prescribing in and out know what all they shouldn't try. He feels that their groups of medicines aren't anything an experienced psychiatrist wouldn't have put together after a failed treatment or two. I will be doing it for opiates though since we believe i over metabolize them since i test clean for opiates ive been observed taking. "
"Okay I’m sorry but... seriously?

There is no reason why you needed to spend a year doing this taper. All of those doctors are right, 2 weeks is plenty of time. If you really wanted to play it safe you could have done 2 weeks at 15, 2 weeks at 10, then 2 weeks at 5. 

SSRI withdrawal will not kill you... the exception being someone with suicidal ideation which can return but that has nothing to do with withdrawal. Worst case scenario you will feel like complete shit for a few days then it’s over.

Who are you going to trust, 6 docs who each went to med school for 4 years plus completed residencies and have decades of combined knowledge, or the Internet?"
"Where are you because I know that where I am in the UK it’s quite hard to get onto a ward, even voluntarily. You have to be assessed by a team who have to agree to put you in and they don’t usually do it unless you lack mental capacity or are at real risk of harming yourself (and I mean risk of you going out in the next couple of days and genuinely trying to kill your self by any means) I’ve been on the waiting list a few times but only been onto a ward once under the section of the mental health act and that was because I was literally coming out of hospital for an od and then trying again in a matter of hours. I almost ended up in ICU at one point. "
"Same. It took me attempting suicide before anybody was willing to face reality.

Afterwards my father talked to me crying how sad he was about it and how much he and the rest of my family would have missed me.

Yeah...I feel like most people want you to not kill yourself because they would miss you, be sad and maybe feel guilty, but not because they want you to be happy. Let alone go out of their way to help you.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a psychiatrist and therapy for a couple months now. On and off because depression and dissociation just say f u and your life. Who needs a job anyways?

Most of the time nobody would answer the phone, or  
it would be a tape saying they are closed now and to try again later and giving the opnening hours (which are like once a week for one hour), or  
they don't take on new patients.

The one that I managed to talk to and kind of get an appointment asked me to call again the next day because the doctor wasn't present at that time. Well, ok, I called the next day and noone answered the phone. I try again several times and it's always busy. That broke me for that time and I never managed to call again... I guess I should."
"I’m also a teacher, so I can say from personal experience that we’re mandated to escalate things like this to the counselor and eventually the parents. So if you really want to work around your parents knowing, that’s probably not the best route. 

Be aware this is something that you will likely get under control but will still need to talk to your parents about at some point. If that time isn’t right now that’s fine. If you’re not ready you’re not ready. 

I think therapy is best. I don’t know of any places that do private counseling for minors. A good place to check might be planned parenthood, as I imagine they are aware of community resources in that area. 

Like I said, getting into therapy is the path to improvement long term. There’s also various suicide hotlines that you can use if you’re in a crisis. Check out https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org. They have a free hotline you can call as well as an online chat. There are also text-based services similar to this where you text with counselors. I encourage you to use these even if you’re not having active suicidal ideation or imminent planning. Most feel like they can’t call unless they’re very deep in the well. It can be used preventatively just to have someone to talk to. 

I know the urges are strong, but they’re irrational. Please don’t act on them. Your older, healthier self will thank you. I am still depressed but I am so thankful I did not act on it when I was younger. If you feel you can’t resist the urges or are really worried you’re going to harm yourself please use the resources above, and if  those don’t work for you talk to your parents as a last resort. "
"I can relate somewhat, for me it's using videogames for being how I can never seem to in real life.  Let me tell you right now that this was needed, no matter how awkward it feels.  So I admire your strength in overcoming all the anxiety over posting here, the bravery of putting yourself out here despite how hard a part of yourself tried to talk you out of it.  You're already taking the first step to solving this by admitting it.

I'm still a work in progress myself, but I got lucky in having a limited forced restriction in my gaming habits when my tower's power supply died recently (so I think).  I think that might help me turn that habit from a self-defeating lifestyle into a more positive and supportive one.   You might want to consider trying to recreate a controlled version of this.  

Find out how to restrict money going into buying food.  It's artificial, but at the start that's okay.  Anything from some kind of withdrawal limits to a business card or handwritten notes you hand out to anywhere you buy food telling them to kick your ass out if any sweets, chocolates, or crisps (etc) appear in your hands or a cart.  Research healthier alternatives to binge if you need to binge.  Spitballing ideas here, but if you want to stop this, you're going to have to start somewhere.

But as you take away, so you must give to yourself.  That binge money?  Go on down to your local community/rec center if they have gyms and or pools.  Just say ""fuck it"" and do this the first time for the novelty of doing something new, of using this crisis for the drive to change even just like this.  It doesn't have to be something hard, or overly ""out there"" in case you have social anxiety, get started simple, easy.  You're going to need to build alternative means of rewarding yourself.

The trick of course is keeping this going over time, motivation is fickle but discipline isn't.  But there is a reason even the military never leaves a recruit alone to discover it, so reaching out for the help to build this discipline is totally fine.  Remember of course that they can provide feedback, guidance, and assistance but YOU are the one who will solve this, the only one who can.

"There's a ton of tips in this playlist by therapist Kati Morton

[anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9r5TmwTM_A&amp;list=PL_loxoCVsWqzYEpSwo3dspzwjkZ46Wb5M)

For me, some things that help are:

Deep breathing exercises  


54321 grounding game -

Name and describe 5 things you can see right now (blue lamp, square pillow, empty water bottle, wet, green grass outside, etc)

4 things you can feel right now (bare feet on cold floor, chair on back, tongue on roof of mouth, etc)

3 things you can hear right now (air conditioner running, people talking in next room, clicking on keyboard)

2 things you can smell right now (cup of tea, candle, nothing)

1 thing you can taste right now (gum, lunch, nothing), or name 1 good thing about yourself (I am a compassionate and understanding person)  


The Alphabet Game -pick a subject like TV Shows, Animals, Books, whatever, and name things in that category starting with A. You can do this one with a friend to distract you, alternating turns/letters.  


Watching a funny show

Listening to calming music (I personally like cello and piano) or try watching Moving Art on Netflix. Nothing fast paced or anything that gets you worked up.

Try putting something heavy on your lap, like a weighted blanket, pillow, your fat cat, or backpack.

Chewing gum or sucking hard candy can also help because it activates your social engagement system and calms your nervous system.

Write down exactly what you're feeling

If you're worried about something specific and it's interrupting your ability to focus on whatever you should be focusing on, give yourself permission to think about it at a specific, later time like after dinner or during study hall if you don't have anything else to do. Set a time limit though, like 15-30 minutes. During that time, allow your mind to think as much as it wants about it. Knowing you've set time aside to worry later can help you focus now.

Coloring in children's coloring books (not adults, I find this too stressful lol) or doing word finds.

Let your friends or family know ahead of time how to help during a panic attack... you might not want 50 people crowding you or may be unable to answer all their questions of ""What can I do????"" in the moment. You might only be able to answer yes/no questions, or need something like a bottle of water to hold, a quiet place to sit, or your medication if you have any. Maybe it would help for them to breathe with you or rub your back. Or maybe you want to be left alone until it passes.

Create an emergency self-care kit (there are tons of ideas on pinterest and youtube)

I often have to do more than one of these things to calm down:)

Hope you find something that works for you!"
"&gt; What should I do? I REALLY want to stick my penis in a 13-year-old girl.

"Because they hate everyone, manipulate people, have no empathy (as in her grandma and grandpa died and felt nothing), and many other signs of a sociopath "
"Fatal Attraction is a good movie about a woman with BPD. Disclaimer: not all people with BPD are like Alex, so don't think they're all bunny boilers, lol."
"Ghost hunting and creepypasta are not the worst way to deal with your feelings. Honestly, that sounds pretty harmless. Is there a reason you want to stop?"

I am here if you need to ramble some more. I am not doing much except sitting here playing a game on my phone and checking these forums every so often. :D
"I don’t have an answer for you, because I’m in the same position. Though I have Asperger’s, so I’m sort of fucked permanently. You’re not alone."
"I feel like I'm reading something I wrote myself. I'm literally sitting here, still in PJs, drinking coffee, wondering if I should have a cigarette. Ugh. "
I will be going to see my Psych soon...I don't want to stop. That is the sucky part of it. Yeah...compulsions can be very strong and hard to resist. &lt;3

As a child growing out was your environment very negative? Did you have a traumatic experience or time growing up? Some people feel comfortable in environments they grew up in cause it's all they know so maybe.. just my opinion I'm not a professional. But you could be seeking or creating the same environment you had growing up cause it's the only thing you know or feel okay in. Hope it makes sense and help!
"First, document examples as factually and non-emotionally as possible.  Then, if you feel comfortable you email the professor your concerns with examples stating your concerns and asking her to consider the impact of her actions. Then if things don't change or if you are afraid of retaliation talk to your student advisor about your concerns. If they won't help feel free to escalate to the dean of students. "
"I'm honestly so fricking happy right now that I've been able to bring to you what was missing from me for so long too, and also let you know (and find out for myself!) that there are others out there that went through these same weird experiences as children.

There's a name for this, and a whole group of us that slip into that weird space sometimes! I know *exactly* what you mean about that puzzle piece :)"
"Is there anyone at work you can talk to? A supervisor or over-all boss? You need to let them know that this project is getting out of control and you need some help and guidance. 

It's okay to ask for help. And if they push back and say 'you should be able to do this on your own', tell them that no, you really do need help, and if they are not willing to provide it, you are going to seek other employment. "
"It's ok. :) I am here if you need me...always here.
Ugh. I am battling my demon yet again...another day to feel awful about myself and not care at the same time. 

Take care of yourself, ok? I am sending TONS of good luck your way!

"I’m on it now - be prepared for some of the most vivid dreams you’ll probably ever have. It messed with my digestion a little bit, but I spoke to my GP and she was able to help. It helped with my anxiety a tonne as before I was prescribed it, I struggled to swallow food. It does occasionally make my muscles twitch a bit, especially in my face, and particularly at night. I hope it works out well for you!"
I’m so sorry you’re struggling! Please try to hold onto hope that there are much brighter days ahead. This will pass! You are so much stronger than you realize and that’s why you are still here with us. Make a playlist of some upbeat music on your phone and listen to that while you go for a brisk walk. Sometimes just taking your mind off of things temporarily is a much needed relief. Sending you hugs
"Sounds like a litmus test of your self awareness.

Actual answer, you need to consider in what things/areas/aspects of your life you are not fully independent. These can be really abstract, and only come up in social or potentially social situations regarding entirely social/emotional constructs. EG, is your confidence independent of constant support from others, and do you frequently fish for that support?"
"The internet really isn't the place well endowed enough to mentally evaluate your daughter, firstly.

Secondly, if I were to put my two cents in: It sounds like either ADD or ADHD. Treatment using Ritalin is quite effective in helping.

Thirdly, really are you just going to say your daughter is ""not all there""? This nonchalance and casual disrespect towards your daughter, is this how you treat her at home? "
"You need to go see a doctor. And you need to get into therapy. You might not want to do these things, but if you don't, things will never change. The Counseling and Recovery Service that I go to offers support groups and they help people find jobs and group homes if that need it. It might not be the same where you live. But it doesn't hurt to try. You need to take the necessary steps towards getting better."
"https://www.memorylosstest.com/digit-span/

set the digit span to something like 4 and click ""new test"". it'll display random numbers that you then have to remember and reproduce. if you can remember 4, try 5, 6, etc - see how far you can go. 

the reason i'm telling you to do this is because ADHD seems associated with poor working memory. you get lost as you're doing the task, hence your attention drifts. "
"Do you write to-do lists? Having a clear plan and sense of progress as you tick off each item can really help. It also helps to see your goals as individual, attainable tasks, rather than getting overwhelmed by them.

I struggle with this a lot too. I try to get my chores done early in the day so I can reward myself by being lazy the rest of the day.

I guess the only other thing I can recommend is setting realistic goals and not pressuring yourself to achieve things that might be temporarily out of reach. Start with the small things and don't beat yourself up if you miss a day - it happens, so start again the next day, and the next day, and the next day. :)"
"For the trauma it's actually usually (and was in my case) the staff as opposed to the kids.

I think that it's really important that everyone's dignity and agency are respected.  He will certainly be more inclined to talk and get something out of therapy if he's the one choosing to be there as opposed to being told he has to go.  Maybe ask him if he could check out profiles of therapists on psychology today and see if he can find someone he might get along with.  Emphasize that therapy can be used for whatever he'd like, even if it's just venting about school, frustrations, or his girlfriend.  Maybe in the end it'll be something that he actually wants to do."
"You are grieving. It starts with the news and never ends. It looks different for everyone, but it's there. There will be ups and downs and good days and terrible days but no matter what happens or what you feel, it does NOT minimize the importance of your friend, how much you loved your friend, or your friends worth to you before and after their death. Just keep riding the waves whenever they come.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't cry about my partner's death for nearly two months. And even then it was sparse as the sadness and longing started to sink in. Crying =/= Love for your loved one. Sadness, pain, and longing =/= Your loved one.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck &lt;3"
" 

&gt;Beware of the quality of counselling in uni-  sometimes I’ve gotten masters students sometimes I’ve gotten nurses  sometimes doctors sometimes social workers or therapists/psychologists.  So go with an open mind if you don’t know.

I had not considered these scenario. I was expecting a chatty female professional who could help me, thanks for reminding me that there are other possibilities as well ahaha. 

&gt;Don’t make plans after therapy  sessions lol.

Makes sense. Right, thanks :) 

&gt; Having questions written is great :) wishing you the best of luck and  congrats on taking the step to make and go to the apt. That’s big!  Reward yourself a little after the session. Cause you done good. 

Thank you! I'm both excited that I'll finally have some support and also nervous, because I'll be talking about stuff that I've never spoken to anyone in life. Hope things go well. Cheers!

"I’m not sure if this will help, but over the past 6 months I’ve kind of slowly been starting to understand the concept of many thoughts just being...thoughts, and trying to remember that the feeling that you have in a specific moment isn’t always going to be the feeling that you have forever.  Our brains, in a way, are working in a weird state of overdrive in modern times because our fight-or-flight stresses are getting constantly released...except it’s not because saber toothed tigers are chasing us, so we have to figure out how to deal with the fallout.  If you can maybe try to step away from your emotions/thoughts as they are happening (not deny or push them away, but kind of just take a step back), you may be slowly able to train yourself to recognize when you are having an onset of negative thinking and just keep in mind at the back of your head that it will pass...kind of like riding a wave out."
"New day = new update. 

To clarify something, I am not a man, I am a woman. Yes, myself and his mother are in a relationship and have been for about 3 years. She has been out since he was about 3 so this isn't anything new to him. 

Over the last 24 hours he seems to have gotten more paranoid and angry. He calls his mother and starts out talking calmly and then gets irate and starts yelling. I have advised her that when he gets that way that she needs to end the call. Not rudely; advise him that she is getting ready to end the call, and if he doesn't stop, hang up. As for the paranoia, he thinks that everyone is out to get him, that the doctors want to keep him longer than 3 days (uhh ya think?) and that everything he says or does is being recorded. At the rate he is going, he won't be getting out on Saturday as he hopes. I want him to be able to come home when he is READY not just because the 72 hours is up."
"Thanks! This is helpful, and I'll look into the syndrome. Im just looking for information and resources right now, not a diagnosis, so thank you!

I've been pushing for treatment for a long time but it's been off and on and while they're living at home it's just not going to happen, I don't think. I'm trying to workshop things they can work on in their own time, like positive self-talk, meditation, etc.

Unfortunately I moved too far to be there for them physically anymore, but I still encourage them to seek help. 

However, seeing a therapist can absolutely cause harm. To call their living situation ""potentially problematic"" is a big understatement. If my friend sought treatment and their family found out, it would get a lot worse real fast and they'd be shamed and psychically bullied into stopping treatment while their mental health took a steep decline. It's happened before.

Thank you again for your help."
"Idk if it helps any, but I'm in, and have experienced the same thing. My only difference being I'm in a long distance relationship too. But as far as the loneliness, it hurts a lot and probably will continue to hurt, but think of this time alone as time to find yourself, what you like to do, what makes you happy. And sometimes just diving into books or a tv show just to escape for a bit helps too. I know that the phrase 'everything will be okay' is the most cliche bs. Because no one truly knows if it is. But know that even though things may feel worse before they feel better, know that you aren't alone in this, you deserve the best the universe has to offer and it will come your way. No one knows when but you just have to be accepting of it. Dont be afraid to reach out to anyone for help, or when someone offers it, dont be afraid to take it, you are never a bother when it comes to helping yourself. As far as the self harm goes, you know it's not safe or healthy for you, it's only a temporary feeling. Please don't be afraid to reach out, message me even, if you need support. There are enough of us out here with the same feelings we can be there for each other. "
"Saying depression isn't physcial is truly a misinformed statement. Every emotion in it's extreme has physical effects, and that includes depression. I was really low just a few days ago, like nearing suicidal low. Years before that I was suicidal, I wanted to kill myself and made constant plans to. Yesterday I wad fine, the best I've been for as long as I can remember. Just a few minutes ago it came back to me in a small little wave, it wasnt anything major but it made me scared and made me panic. I managed to pull through with the aid of positive redditors and my own determination. Right now, I am fine, not as good as yesterday but I am fine. My depression is manageable right now. What I'm saying is, things change and shift and some days are way worse than others but one day it's going to be better even if that isn't now. I know how much it sucks to have to fight through these points and these negative thoughts and these chest pains but it will get better. Even if temporarily, but honestly when you get back to that high point it's a lot easier to keep yourself up and above major depression. But it's going to be so so so much easier with help. Most of us in this subreddit are here to help and can give you our support but I think the best option is to go to a professional and try to get better and reply on them to help keep you above major depression&lt;3
Feel free to pm me if you need it :) I wish you the best."
" Don’t have any helpful advice, but I’m also struggling in school due to bipolar and other conditions so just know you’re not alone. We can do this! "
"Ah, that makes sense. You could try journaling. For me, writing down my feelings helps me process them so they don't leap out at me unexpectedly like that."
Hey dude you can always message me. I completely understand the urge to but if you need someone to talk you down and understand I’m totally here for you.
"Hi there, this is the Australian version but I’m sure you’ll be able to find one in your region also. He is the link https://www.psychologytoday.com/au"
I just feel like I'm not fit to raise him. I don't have it in me. And I'm worried he is going to be developmentally delayed because of lack of interaction
I tell him I love him as much as I can. That won't change. It's hard for me to express my feelings sometimes but I am learning how to be better about that.
If i had a gun i would have shot myself ayear ago. i lost my job and my family and suffered an extreme breakdown. I'm glad I didn't as I'm much better now.
"Interesting. I mean, as long as you don't hurt anyone or do anything wreckless, is there anything bad about it? I'm honestly curious, don't mean to offend."

Maybe check around for free clinics. You can also ask any therapist (or psychiatrist) if they can work on sliding scale of they don't take your insurance.
Not uncommon.  I was on Effexor for years when it seemed to suddenly stopped working.  I had to wean off and try another.  I am on Sertraline (Zoloft) now.

"Either way, thanks for the advice and support, I am glad I can talk to you and I agree school is bullshit, I also berg my parents not to send me and it also makes me feel dumb a lot of times for not doing good enough in tests and not being able to properly talk to people. I am thinking of going to uni so I will probably have to still wake up on Septembers lol but I agree, it will definitely be easier. Thanks"
"Hey, so first i just want to say it sucks you're goung through this but also, this happened to me too. (I think)  A few nights ago i went to sleep but i felt like i didnt exist and all of a sudden it felt like i was spit back out into reality when i woke up. Ive been struggling a lot with my BPD anxiety and depressiin lately. Was this how you felt? If you need to talk, im here for you to vent to. Take care. "
I know how you feel I was in a relationship that last four years and five months and he ended up breaking it off with me after he found a pregnant women more interesting than me. But honestly I felt trapped and suffocated in the relationship when I was with him. He changed me into someone I always didn't want to be and to this day I am thankful he let me be free. My life is a lot better without the bullshit
"I've been with men like this. Please, for the sake of your mental health take this seriously and don't think that this won't have repercussions later on down the line. The more you put up with this crap now, the bigger a chance you'll have issues in future relationships because shit like this can sometimes really get embedded in your mind. It's a terrible way to treat someone and he doesn't deserve you tbh. "
If you phone 111 in U.K. they do end up eventually sending an ambulance to check on you even after they’ve talked you down. Because they are so busy this can often be 4-6 hours later and may result them forcing you to go to hospital if they think you are still at risk. I do think its good that they check on you but sadly it would be too late in most cases if you were to follow through on suicidal thoughts.
"It's not the same. Drag is a performative action, not a sexual one. It's closer to one of my friend's therapists looking forward to seeing her perform in The Tempest. She did come to her performance and complimented her on her performance. 

When I am in drag - with the particular type of role I have - I am acting as a member of our community and minister to the community (drag nun). It's not sexual at all. "
"Jesus Christ my inpatient weeklong stay was not even close to this bad. I actually was terrified of going back home. Ours was clean, we had free roam and fun group sessions, and the nurses were all pretty nice. The showers were terrible - at first it would be cold, like you said, and then it would be really hot, with no inbetween - but that was abourmt it. I didn't realize how different psych wards could be."
"My anxiety and depression has always come with physical symptoms. Extreme fatigue, tense and sore muscles, racing heart, etc are definitely things I still deal with. 

It could be because of a previous physical issue but considering the symptoms you listed I would absolutely consider the possibility it is from anxiety.

Would you consider seeing a therapist? Maybe they could help you where the MDs could not."
"Devastating . I know exactly what it feels like and this sadly hits too close to home for me . It drives me crazy when people say, “How could she do that , she must be a bad person, how selfish of her ” when they have absolutely no idea what it feels like to go through something as cruel and awful as depression  or to get to a point where you’re just completely hopeless and see no other way out .

Prayers and positive vibes for not only her but her family . It’s really sad that her mom didn’t take her cry for help seriously . Now she has to live with that regret for the rest of her life . Very well written as well OP .. thanks for sharing with us . "
"I have been sort of in Kelly's shoes. I had a mental break of sorts (anxiety and depression got worse than I realized) and my manager had the same concern. My manager and our HR person at work recommend I see a psychiatrist and apply for FMLA. The psychological testing wasn't exactly cheap, and they suggested 2-4 weeks off work to adjust to medications. I have been allowed to use that time as needed (2 weeks off and certain days here and there). 
Now comes the hard part, the approach. When in that paranoid state of mind, having somebody of ""authority"" is a very scary event. If you can, find out who Kelly has a good relationship with and try to approach them. "
"I have definitely experienced a number of things you are describing since childhood. I would cycle between feeling absolutely huge, actually in my case it was more swollen, and then very thin and twig like. I would also have this sense of weird time where things felt fast and slow and it's disturbing to experience. The sound is the worst, it sounds like all the molecules are screaming at me in some alien like fashion. 

I have these attacks a lot less frequently but the time dilation and the sound still happen more often.  I've never been able to find an explanation for it and people have a hard time grasping what I am talking about when I try to describe it."
"Yeah I know it’s not healthy but it’s just... comfortable, I guess, for me to think this way now. I’m extremely introverted as well, so coupling all of these variables on top of one another makes for a flaky me. I’ve set up many plans with family, tried to with friends a few times, but I’ve only managed to follow through maybe 5 times over the past 20 attempts. It demoralizes me, and my motivation is already stupid low. I went and bought a guitar and played it for maybe 2 weeks, haven’t touched it in nearly 2 months now. I just don’t know how to push myself anymore. Thank you for your kind words though, it settled my mind for a bit reading this."
"&gt; Airing them helps me to come to terms with my emotions. Sometimes I’ll type or say something about the situation from an angle I haven’t considered.

Yes, that's right.  But do so with a male therapist and not a female.  You need a male perspective, most female therapists, and therapists in general have been educated in the most liberal programs, they are not going to give straight up guidance.  Just trust me.  Secondly, you do not need to understand your ex-wife.  Remember, you're done, she walked out to another man because you were likely not being strong enough for her.  She found someone else.  Stay with the music and the band.  yes we are social creatures but you do NOT need a female companion, you can share your accomplishments with other men, whom you trust.  Once you are stronger, financially stable, and in better mental health, not needy for companionship, you can get back out there dating..."
"I can relate to so much of what you said, on both sides of the equation. I don’t have easy answers and continue to struggle with all of this myself, but I want to make sure you and your friend at least know about 211, the social services hotline that functions as kind of a hub of all the social services in the area. You can either call them to do a phone intake (everything is 100 percent free) or look up your state website (for example, google search “Iowa 211”) and they may be able to help you find some local affordable mental health services in the area. I would also say that it’s a very good idea to get a counselor or some support yourself to discuss this with and get ideas for how to support your friend. And I completely echo everything r/orantte said above, I think it’s a great comment with a lot of insight. I wish you very much the best and hope your friend is able to get through this and heal."
"I know this feeling exactly. First and foremost, let me say, you don’t necessarily need psychiatric help. You may, but if you don’t want to jump immediately into that, that’s fine as well. 

In my experience with this and through eventually getting help from a psychiatrist I learned this; when you’re at your low, something is obviously causing it, taking time to be introspective and trying to pinpoint the genesis of those feelings I’ve found does incredible things for my psyche. It’s not always easy, but if I can look inward and think deeply to identify what it is that has put me in my bad mental state, letting that thought go or confronting it with yourself or whomever has caused it may just pull you out of your funk.

Try it, id you’d like. But if it doesn’t help the first or second time, don’t give up, it can take time to learn the technique that will work best for you in terms of achieving s of awareness. If that doesn’t work when you’re feeling down, then as others have mentioned it may not be a terrible idea to seek assistance. Best of luck to you, and if you fee like you need help, DM me. Sometimes folks just need someone to listen."
"I definitely understand the struggle of expressing everything only to have a therapist look back sympathetically, it's the reason I left my last therapist. I've been searching for months to find one that fits, and I might be searching for months more. When it comes to deeper problems often times specialized care is required and you have to find therapists that treat specific problems. I am looking into methods I never even thought I would try just because I'm at the ""Hell, why not"" point. I'm skeptical, but I am going to try hypnotherapy. You might want to look into it a bit and see if it strikes your ""why not"" fancy. 

In patient treatment at a hospital may be an option if you truly think you have nowhere to go. I accidentally overdosed and stayed at one for less than a week. Going there I was terrified, pretty convinced it was going to be unpleasant. But my stay there was great. It puts you in an environment where you really improve, with the perspectives of people troubled like yourself. I was really amazed at how many different kinds of people were there, made friends with people I would have never otherwise talked to. The goal of a short term psych stay isn't necessarily to fix you, it's to help give you the tools and help guide you towards your next steps in recovery.

You may also want to consider looking into options for abusers looking to recover and change abusive behavior. My knowledge is very limited on that process, and I am someone who often lacks the ability to empathize with abusers as a survivor. Though I do believe that anyone who honestly wishes to better themselves should have the chance to do so in an environment free of shame and judgement. "

Don't be scared to get on medication. And don't be afraid to admit that you need help. Go to a doctor. And go to a therapist. You'll feel much better later.
"Holy shit, me and you have a lot of the same personality traits, have you been checked for autism and anti-social personality disorder. They're what i have."
I am sceptical about the accuracy and/or validity of online testing. Speaking frankly with a doctor is the most sensible way to begin reaching a diagnosis.

So I used this method and she called a psychiatric centre. They told her they will call her tomorrow and tell her the available dates. Thanks for the advice
Thanks a lot for replying I appreciate it. In a way going to see a therapist feels like me admitting that I'm not okay which is probably the scariest part.
That is really interesting. Not many people have mentioned anything like that. Or maybe I just haven't talked to many people who have issues with drinking.
That makes me feel fantastic! I have to go now (kids are in school and I need to go walk and do stuff...ahem...) but I will be on a bit later. See ya later!
That was a lifetime ago - back when I was a Freshman in college! To be clear - I finished an undergrad degree in Architecture but never worked in the field.
Well that sounds wonderful. I didn't undergo sex reassignment surgery. Now how do I fix my life-long gender dysphoria that will very likely kill me one day?
Yep. I feel like everything I say/think is like a script. I try to scratch deeeper into my head to know what I truly am. I can never find nothing at all. :)
Yes seriously. Even on the nhs website it states to do it at an extreamly slow rate. So please if your not here to help and give advice kindly not comment.

You need to trust your therapist when they say they won't do it. They're licensed professionals and it's illegal for them to lie about something like that.
You should look into Seasonal Affective Disorder (aka SAD).  It usually affects people in the winter months but it can also affect people in the summer too.

But just remember even if your child has schizophrenia (I doubt it will though) that it's not a death wish and awful life like most people believe. There is times of struggle but we're normal people too and we just require a little more support. I hope the best for you."
"I never said stimulant.

Calming is what depressants are and no they dont have anything to do with anti-depressants.

Opioids are depressants and give hallucinations.

Marijuana also a depressant gives you hallucinations.

I have never seen any research that oils work they only give you the same calming effect meds give you.

Natural or synthetic drugs are the same they do the same only the name is different."
"That's honestly what it feels like. Constantly just being outside your own body and being able to see every single emotion that I'm feeling at once. A kind ear, or even just talking on here helps draw me back to my own body and to verbalise/type my feelings. 
I definitely am not ready to deal with those feelings, but I know they're a lot more organised for when I am ready and that provides a little comfort. 
"
"Yeah I had a period of severe social anxiety when I was 14. I stopped going to school and seeing/talking to people. I’m clearly better now though. People who don’t know me still think I’m shy or something. I didn’t make a single real friend (real meaning that I do have a few people that I can tolerate because they’re useful and they like me) in my new class, cause they look boring and idiots though."
"You're welcome! Seeing a therapist is your decision, of course, so no pressure from me to do it. However, I just would like to point out that there's no commitment if you decide you don't want to continue seeing a therapist. In other words, you can always stop with the sessions if you don't like it. Nothing wrong with that at all.  

If there's anything that comes up that you have a question on, let me know. "
"As a woman, I used to only want a female therapist. I tried a few and found that I didn't have a connection with them. I ultimately ended up with a male therapist not much older than I am (I'm 30, he's probably 34 or so). 

Psychologytoday.com is a good resource. They'll list a bunch of therapists in your area and what their specialities are, and usually there's a paragraph or two written by the counselor describing their practice and their approach. 

If you're looking for a certain type of therapy (such as CBT or DBT) and it doesn't mention on the site if the therapist you're looking at utilizes that method, you can always call them and find out! 

Good luck"

"I disagree that it needs to be illegal.  I think it does need to get a hell of a lot better than it is.  I've worked for agencies who primarily provide mental health services for kids.  In my experience, doctors are way too quick to shell out diagnoses of ADHD and medicate rather than refer to therapy, or what really should happen, is refer the family to family therapy.


I would agree that I think there need to be more strict age limits on psych meds for children barring extreme circumstances that need to be well assessed and documented.  


Thankfully in most states like where I practice (Pennsylvania) once a child reaches 14 they can not be forced into treatment whether that be therapy or seeing a psychiatrist without their written consent.  If a child refuses to sign, it is illegal for providers to work with them.  Some other states have ages of consent that are lower than 18, but unfortunately not all.    "
"There’s this app called Bedsider that sends fun reminders every day at a time you choose. Stuff like motivational quotes, links to ideas to do on a day off, fun facts, etc. Typically it has to do with relationships or sex life stuff since it’s technically targeted for birth control, but I find them fun.  If that’s not your thing, I’m sure there are some other apps that have fun reminders that aren’t targeting birth control. 
I know you said you’ve already tried setting reminders, but maybe having a cool thing to read and look forward to might help. That or, for the reminders you already have on your phone, you could set it so that it will not leave the screen until you click it off. 
Keep in mind I’m saying all of this from an iPhone user perspective, I don’t know how other smartphones work or if you have one. 
Another thing you could try is setting your pills by your toothbrush. 
Best of luck! "
"Yeah I get that. Sometimes you really just can't win. My psychotic symptoms/mania started as a result of PTSD. I started to believe that everybody was out to get me. And I started walking around staring at people. Just to see if they were acting weird around me. And just to see if they were against me. My paranoia was so bad that I could barely make it through a shift at work.

I eventually had to lie about some other issues in order to get out of there. I wanted to quit but they offered me medical so I took it. The biggest mistake I made though was going back there after the medical leave. It only made things worse.

I don't have anything to prove to anybody though. If people don't believe me then that's not my problem. It's not like I'll ever see my old coworkers ever again. Nor do I want to either. My heart was broken so much during that time. And I don't think I could ever be around those people ever again."
"It's 2018. The stigma of concealing mental health issues is dying slowly but surely. Do me a favor and kill it immediately for yourself. No one will care if you have mental health issues. They won't judge you. What they will do however is worry about you MORE if keep hiding these issues. Everyone has problems, some just learn how to mask them and cope with them better than others. Tell your family what's wrong and maybe they can explain to you from their point of view what could be causing you to feel the way you do, or maybe even give you advice. No one knows you better than your parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Medication is a form of masking, and if that is something you think you should take, go for it. Try it out and see if it's helpful. But let me warn you, medication is nothing more than a suppressing agent, used to level your state of mind so you can THEN be in position to address the real problems at hand. No medicine will rid you of what's truly wrong, it is simply a type of armor you can use in the battle of - what we call - ""Life"".

"Always know that you're not a burden to anyone! You're loved by everyone who you're acquainted with. Your feelings might result from just a bit of burnout, take some of your free time to explore new things and do things that you like doing as opposed to things you 'need' to do. If you're about to turn 18, perhaps take seeking therapy into your own hands if it is covered by your insurance (it usually is). Don't rely on your family to try and make things better for you if they won't be as understanding, simply take it into your own hands to seek your own best interests. Lastly, things always get better when you realize the issue. Those feelings of emptiness and worthlessness perhaps come from what you truly feel you are, in that case the only person who can change that is you. No one will ever be able to take those feelings away but you. Find something you like, try new things until you find something that makes you feel happy and accomplished, things that will make you feel 'full' and like you've done something that you've wanted to do for so long, but you have to gain momentum and do something about it. If everyone simply did things that they were suppose to every single day of their life and then went to sleep after and just repeated the process again and again, I'm sure they would feel the same way you do, empty and worthless, but as is not the case. Perhaps you haven't found your niche yet, but you have to go out there and pursue it, standing around and doing the same 'necessary' things will not ever make you feel happy and satisfied. Look around and realize that everyone who leads a healthy life focuses a lot on work, but also on relaxing with something they like and giving their mind a break, if not, negative thoughts are bound to arise. It's logical, if you never do anything you genuinely like then how're you suppose to have positive feelings about your day to day lifestyle! Become your own change and own it."
"Well, that's where this gets interesting. I had to move from the house I lived in because my roommate was getting married, so I decided to buy a condo. The condo just happened to be about a mile &amp; a half from where he lived. Didn't see him at all for about 4-6 months, then, shortly after I moved in, there was a knock on my door, and it was him. I didn't even know he knew where I lived, but his father was in law enforcement so I assumed that's how he found me. Anyways, he said he just wanted to come by &amp; see my place so, he came in &amp; we talked for a while then he started to put a move on me. I told him - ""Get the fuck out!!"" That REALLY pissed me off. He thinks I'm gonna now be his side cheat. FUCK THAT!! Interesting thing is - he'd rode over on his new 10 speed bike because he was trying to exercise &amp; lose some weight. SO, the next morning when I was getting ready to go to work, I had a great idea. He still had the same phone number &amp; I knew he'd already left for work, so I called his house - and, when his new girlfriend sleepily answered, I sad - - ""You can tell Terry not to be riding over to my house anymore to try &amp; get a piece of ass from me anymore, because I'm not interested."" and hung up. (this was way before caller ID) I knew she'd know if I threw the bike in there. LOL. I was soooooooo proud of myself. That even made me happier that I'd ditched the asshole long ago.  --- A couple of years later, I was walking into my office from the parking garage &amp; there he is working (He was am electrical lineman &amp; they were putting in some lines right by my office building). I couldn't avoid him because he looked right at me &amp; was right in front of me. He started walking towards me &amp; saying hello, so I stopped to talk to him. He told me - ""You really did me dirty back then. She was ready to kick my ass by the time I got home from work."" I told him - ""And you would have deserved every bit of it."" - We actually laughed about it. He was no longer with her. I guess at her young age she'd decided to move on to someone her own age. That was the last time I saw him. I wished him well &amp; he did the same to me. (It's funny how you can be so close &amp; so intimate with someone for 4 years &amp; then meet up with them &amp; it's like you're just friends &amp; all of that no longer exists or means anything. That was the sad part. I missed the way we were but knew we could never get it back)"

I can't tell you that because I struggle with those same thoughts. I'm not sure what's real anymore. That's why you need to go to a doctor. Don't be like me.

Haha that’s usually my attitude with my parents about this stuff but that conversation just sorta stuck to me. My dad actually has depression and kinda understands somewhat so he tried talking to her about not overreacting and communicating better but I think that conversation went right over her head. I just can’t wait for the day where I can move out and not have all this negative talk on my back. ��
"I get pissed off because we have no free will. I’m not even allowed to drive fast because people fucking suck at driving. I have 0 accidents. Meanwhile I have friends with 1-3 accidents under their belt while driving the speed limit.

"OP didn't make the deal that they wouldn't seek professional help though. If anything, this gives them the motivation to seek professional help so that they are helping each other instead of just themselves.

"Thank you for sharing your experience and your advice. I am in therapy, but the therapists I deal with are rather specialiyzed in chronic depression and autism-spectrum-disorder. So far my self-harm hasnt appeared to be out of place for my diagnosis, but I have never met any other patients with this similarity.

How are you doing with self-hatred nowadays? What are you doing to keep yourself from falling back?"
"Thank you, that's insightful.  It's true, I don't know which story to go with.  I've actually been in trauma therapy for six months and I have barely covered any of this because they are so focused on my dissociation.  And it's not because I haven't spoken up.  I'm afraid if I pick the more feel good story that I will be deluding myself.  I found a cult specialist that I am going to try and get answers from.  "
That is one of the things that bug me. I'm not really sure if this insecurity is legitimate or not. I could just be being self destructive and everything Im worried about isnt true. But on the other hand my worries are in fact real and Im living the life of a social outcast. I have taken into consideration that I am with them a lot as a source of my plight and it is not something I can moderate properly sadly.

You’re asking the questions. Keep asking. Just maybe believe it’s a process. You will recover and you will be stronger. Take the time perhaps to feel the pain analyse how it came about decide what you think you can change and see if you can do better. If not... try again. I believe we have to fail to succeed. The failures become smaller or different if we learn. Keep the faith. You don’t seem weak to me.
"Hey, thanks for all your help and advice. I went to the center and believe it or not, they didn’t even have my appointment set in the system from the hospital I was at. The case worker took me in and looked for my appointment but couldn’t find it anywhere so I was set up with a new appointment altogether. I spent maybe 10 minutes max explaining everything and he set an IOP intake next week. 

I asked how long does this normally take and he said that an intake normally lasts 2-3 hours. I’m going to be going 4 times and then they’re sending me off to a normal therapist/psychiatrist. 

I was so paranoid. I couldn’t sleep. Just wanted to thank you again. "
"I'm really sorry to hear that you're in such emotional pain. But I'm glad to hear that you're motivated to keep going in spite of it all. Have you considered maybe doing a therapy program instead of once a week therapy? I did a DBT program, and it changed my life. It's a very helpful program for those who struggle with emotional pain and emotional intensity and those who have not responded well to other treatments. Maybe it would be something to consider? I was at my breaking point before I started DBT and I improved significantly while in it. Either way, I hope you're able to find something that works for you and that you find some relief from your suffering. "
"Thank you for sharing. I'm also seeing a lot of myself into you, down to the video games not giving me much joy anymore.

Do you know if it's probable to treat it without seeking medications? Being an expatriate, the non-subsidized rate will be huge for me, not to mention my insurance coverage for mental need is sparse at best, and I'm in culture &amp; region where my employer will probably look at me funny if they knew I'm seeing psychologists.

I was looking at a combination of self CBT along with mindfulness/meditation, but I concede that I'll look for medical help if it's the only way since I just can't function well at all at this stage.

Thank you again. "
"Understand that your family can be your greatest asset or your worst liability.  You know what yours is.  Understand that you appear to be powerless to do anything and your long rant is because you are chaining one problem with a another.  That is understandable.

There is no magic answer.  Right now, it sucks to be you.  The silver lining is that it doesn't always have to be this way unless you give up.  At some point, you will need to get out and you need to start planning your escape now.  Nobody will give you shit for what you are going to do.  You only earn respect by having done it. Again, quietly start the plan for the rest of your life now.  Good Luck! "
"***Edit: Also, /u/Ryaubee is not a counselor. Please do not take advice from her. She is a writer and her behaviour on this sub is incredibly misguided and inappropriate.***

I didn't read anything after Deluth model tbh. That immediately put me off and I'm not here to discuss childhood trauma and treatment methods for abusers. I'm here to discuss the fact that you are behaving unethically. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that this person is abusive in any way outside of the biased statements described. You really need to take a step back.

&gt;I certainly don't want to say that he is. But I'm also recommending that he gets a BIP assessment, for the safety of OP.

I'm saying this as a professional, you are behaving extremely inappropriately and if I knew who you were I'd report you for overstepping your professional boundaries."
"I think the best advice for those situations is remind them you're here for them and you care about them. Try to really make it clear that you care and that whether they want to talk about it or just sit with it and distract themself you'll still be right there beside them. Help with organising professional support if you can. Your heart's obviously in the right place as you're asking this and want to help them so just be there and be open if they want to talk, or just stay with them if they don't. Having depressive periods and suicidal thoughts can be quite isolating and often (I've been there) it's hard to believe that other people do actually care as you're so wrapped up in the depression. Obviously get them help and do all of that practical stuff but I've found it's really helpful just having someone sit with me and chat about the most random stuff or play a game. Good luck and I hope the situation improves!"
"The antidepressant effects of acute sleep deprivation are actually pretty well-studied. The effect is real and very powerful. The problem is it's not sustainable. The longer-term effects will catch up to you and make the depression worse long-term, it's a quick fix. The effects wear off as soon as you sleep normally again. 

As someone who's been in treatment for insomnia since around age 3 and depression since age 11 I'm very familiar with the effect and also know on balance healthy sleep is better. 

There are other options like sleep restriction therapy or multiple sleeping (rather than sleeping in one big block have two periods with an awake bit in the middle) to optimize the sleep/depression balance but they take a lot of work and should be done with your doctor.

Think of no sleep helping depression like an administration of thorazine for acute psychosis/mania: works really well but only in the short term."
"Yes of course its normal. Both sexes commonly have rape *fantasies*. Fantasies are not necessarily connected to any desire to carry them out. The fantasy of rape, and the actual intent to rape, are totally different things. Realisation of fantasy can be in the form of role play, masturbation, etc (and commonly is). Its nothing to feel bad about, as long as it never crosses over into an actual desire to harm someone in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

You may want to consider why this is a current theme for you. ""Rape"" is not about sex. Its about power. If you are ruminating about rape, its probably an indication that you are otherwise feeling powerless about something. (hence the strong desire to dominate and control another person). Again, feeling powerless is not inherently a bad thing, and is a normal part of human experience. It may be useful for you though to consider the fantasy of rape a sign, and to consider why its so present in life right now for you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to understand rape fantasies of both sexes better, a supportive community might be /r/sex or (if you are over 30 years of age) another (posibly more informed community) is  /r/sexover30"

To the point you recognize what you're doing, but have difficulty stopping oneself. Oh the joys of over honesty heh. It feels like being Jim Carrey in Liar Liar. =_=

Edit:// see, I knew it, another one with a Linda (or Lynda) mom. XD"
"I agree but I also have no clue how to say that. It's VERY hard to say and I fear I might set her off or something. I tell her she's beautiful all the time, encourage her to set appearance goals in the mirror (toning muscles, etc) rather than losing weight, and genuinely try to get it out of her head. Sometimes she admits she's in her own head, but today was different with how she said the ""look skinny"" thing. "
"I got to choose. I am in Pennsylvania.

I chose a psych hospital that I knew. I had been there as a teenager, but now it has moved to a different area...but it is still the same hospital. :) That made it a lot more comfortable to get help, at a time when I wanted nothing more than to die at my own hands. I fear I might be headed BACK there if anyone finds out about my issue I have now. Ugh.

I hope that helped."
I have two children who both were exposed to SSRIs through my blood while I was preg. My dr felt the risk of postpartum or depression during pregnancy outweighed the very very low chance of an issue for the babies (I believe it’s a rare heart defect they worry about). To be honest I think most have the same results but I was switched to sertraline for pregnancy and had no problems. Both kids are flourishing.
I would go to counselling regularly to get help for your depression. You should try and get hold of your old friends whether it be over social media or knocking on their door for a chat; it's been long enough if you still care about them and think about them then you may well see what happens at least you will get some closure or even reconnect. Also remember those who still care for you and are there for you.
"It depends partly on [cultural settings](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/when-hearing-voices-is-a-good-thing/374863/). 

I've also seen plenty of people talk about positive or neutral hallucinations, as well as studies talking about prevalence of positive vs negative reactions to hallucinations. Those seem to indicate more scary hallucinations than good hallucinations, but there is a mixture."
"It's funny you mention that you'd quit drinking only a month ago. I had a similar experience in my first few months of sobriety. I drank on and off ... heavily ... for 2 decades or more, and finally I said enough was enough. So on Sept. 11th, 2016 I gave it up for good. I just celebrated 2 years sober. I wonder if it has to do with withdrawals or something. I hope you feel better! Congrats on one month sober!!!"
"Man, that blows. 

Is there anyone else you’d like to take? Just as friends? If not, there’s nothing wrong with going to a dance alone, especially if you have the courage to ask random people to dance!

That, or go with a larger friend group. 

Sorry again my friend. These things happen, and they suck. Embrace that it sucks, feel your feelings, and then move on—that’s the best advice I can offer you!


"
"Oh geez...what a thing to go through. I say your attatchment to women like that is directly related to your mom. You were always seeking acceptance from her, and never getting it, so it is like an itch you can't scratch. You are still seeking that acceptance. Can you go talk to someone about this? I think you need to get all this out to a professional so he/she can help you get your self-esteem back. Good luck!"
"Pretty sure the claim there’s any risk of skin damage is wholly unsubstantiated. As long as it’s a decent quality box anyway. I have a Northern Light brand box that claims to block all UV radiation. Haven’t been using it long enough to comment on its efficacy, but I’ve been using it for a fair amount of time every day for a couple of weeks or so and have had no ill effects, for whatever that’s worth. "
"What you did is not good but you need help and you need it like yesterday!

I think you are lashing out because you are not okay in yourself it is natural but it is what you do that counts.

Remember that you can learn to cope and things can get better with time change is possible.I made a video on YouTube that I think might help you manage Depression:[https://youtu.be/0y2MQNkCbLE](https://youtu.be/0y2MQNkCbLE)"
"Yeah, I know. It's a vicious cycle. That is why I refuse to take antidepressants, even though I have been diagnosed with pretty severe Depression (Major Depressive Disorder) and Anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder), a history of Anorexia Nervosa, recovering Alcoholic, and now I can add Pyromania to that. :( I take Clonidine for the Anxiety (and it quiets my urges to light fires and helps me sleep) but that is IT."
"Also in my experience, in real life, unfortunately IS that regardless the issue - age automatically equates to more experience or wisdom. A good majority of my older peers are more than willing to disregard others or their issues because they have not lived as long, been through as much, etc. I was told once I was too young to have PTSD, and that I hadn’t lived long enough to be traumatized to that point. 

While it may sound ridiculous to you, I would hope, it’s a common occurrence that arrogance like this happens. So please, spare me your annoyance. I didn’t disregard anyone as you’re disregarding me right now, I inquired because I didn’t understand."
"I took 10mg a few years ago and developed one of the rarest side effect. Wasn’t even on the medication poster before. It’s called Tardive Dyskinesia, and my eye muscles would spasm and my eyes would roll back into my head uncontrollably. It was extremely painful and exhausting, and I would have to almost drug myself to sleep because it would only stop after sleeping, and who could fall asleep while spasming?

I saw this year on the updated poster that they added the side effect to the list. Glad they did that now, it took me 2 GPs and 1 psychiatrist to figure out what was going on. Even when I was hospitalized for depression, the nurses didn’t believe me. "
"Sounds like it could be helpful but I agree with other replies that say you both should really seek professional help on this one.  If you can support one another, help keep each other accountable, and be each other's cheering squads, this could be a really awesome deal.  

The only problem I see with this is it looks like each of you are going to do these things primarily for the other person rather than for yourselves.  That's not going to be enough to get either of you through.  The first time one of you makes the other mad, you'll likely return to old habits out of spite and it will be all too easy to blame the other person rather than take responsibility.  "
"Yes I was also thinking about changing the medication, but I don't know if that's the path I want to take. I don't think that my problem is chemical imbalance, it's that I'm feeling bad physically. I've experienced some real anxiety recently, because I had to tell my parents that I lost something important and it made me realize that I'm not that anxious about these symptoms, it's just painful and frustrating for me. All my mental health problems are secondary and wouldn't be there without the physical symptoms.

I don't want to learn to be ok with this :( I just want it to be gone or at least better. I don't want to live like a overmedicated twitching zombie :("
"Yes, and I'm a practicing psychologist. Not only is the Wikipedia article much more balanced than you suggest, I've read considerably more than one unreviewed Wikipedia page to obtain my degree in psychology. Again, saying something is unscientific simply because you don't like or don't understand it is academically dishonest. Any model or theory in psychology has flaws, that does not make them useless or unscientific. Science is about gathering knowledge, not simply possessing all knowledge that exists.

Again, while the big five has flaws, it's not total garbage and it is useful. If, for nothing else, as a building block for further exploration. Arguably more."
"Beware of the quality of counselling in uni- sometimes I’ve gotten masters students sometimes I’ve gotten nurses sometimes doctors sometimes social workers or therapists/psychologists. So go with an open mind if you don’t know. 

A hard lesson I learned through therapy was that they are there to help you fix your own problems, they will not fix your problems for you. 

Finally, any tools you learn in therapy (ex mindfulness excercises or CBT style therapy) you need to practice. It won’t happen all at once

And finally - the therapy hangover. After a session of disclosing and talking through some emotional shit, you’ll be tired emotionally and physically. Don’t make plans after therapy sessions lol. 

Having questions written is great :) wishing you the best of luck and congrats on taking the step to make and go to the apt. That’s big! Reward yourself a little after the session. Cause you done good. "
"So, I don't have BPD, but my husband does. So this is in my perspective of a loved one. 

It's going to be hard. I'm not going to mince words. It's going to be hard on you, your friends, and your family. But, the good news is that you now have a diagnoses. You now know where to start on the path of recovery. 

Do your research. Have your friends and family read ""I hate you, Don't leave me"" It'll help them understand a bit of what you are going through, and reasons on why your behavior is the way it is. 

You'll find people won't care enough to read, then complain about you. You'll also find people who will go above and beyond trying to understand and help you. 

It's going to be hard, but you can do it. You'll have the support you need via doctors, family, and friends. It will take time, maybe medications, setbacks, and accomplishments. 

Just don't forget to tell others you love them, and remember you are loved."
"The last thing you should do if you're concerned about the mental / general well-being of your friend is call the police, especially if he's unstable. Their presence could lead to various unwanted outcomes. I am not sure of proper resources to respond to this effectively, but engaging your friend with authority seems wrong. So much of the information you've provided is problematic, along with your reference to him as a psycho. Support him in contacting a mental health professional, or call on a trusted loved one of his to assist. Best of luck.

Edit: Upon review of your post history, I clearly see you have admitted to committing a crime by threatening another person with a knife, and your capacity to hurt other people over objectively small offenses. Perhaps you should try to resolve these things with a professional, to potentially lower the risk of you harming yourself or others.

Edit II: Spelling and whatever."
"My therapist says that I'm afraid of feel empowered.

I having been in a process of 8 years falling and getting out of depression, I want to feel empowered (capable) but is hard for me because I don't know how to handle it (I have Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder) and I also deal with usual abulia and asthenia of depression.

At this moment is very clear to me that I don't have DID, there is no trauma or anything like that, I'm dealing with other issues and imagining someone else is a way to get that, I say, ""I can't do it, but she does."" An idea that could have born of the movie fight club, for further explanation.

I'm not gonna deny that the idea of a collective mind makes me feel euphoric since I romanticise the disease but is because I'm having struggles dealing with discrimination, socialization and organising my thoughts. My dad was diagnosed with cancer as well and is hard for me get an optimistic perspective of life.

I need to take another path, I'm a bit desperate, but creating a ""fake alt"" is not an option, I don't want to affect people with this issue and I'm sorry for the people I might have bothered, I just need help."
"Do your job calmly and professionally.  If you don't think you can do that, look for another job.  

Right now, as you've acknowledged, you are not medical staff, so don't try to do medical staffs' job. If you want to do medical staffs' job, get whatever training they have and look for openings in medical staff. 

From my time in psych wards, people who knew nothing about me or medicine chiming in on what they thought I needed to do was one of the more frustrating, harmful, and occasionally threatening aspects of my time there.  I'd be minding my own business, getting hauled from whatever arbitrary location some faceless ""they"" decided I should be at that time to the next, just trying to sleep, or otherwise just existing, and then some rando--some rando *much* larger than me, who by the very nature of their job had the authority to beat my ass if they could even halfway justify it, and who I would learn later as an adult will often get supplied with a reason after beating a patient at certain facilities--would frown at me, lean in close, and say something like...

* ""You wanna see a magic trick?""

* ""You should smile more.""

* ""This is all for your own good.""

* ""This, too, shall pass.""

* ""You're too cute to be so sad.""

* ""You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.""

* ""Quit dragging your feet.""

* ""You wanna see my cool scar?""

* ""Wanna hear a funny joke?""

* ""I don't know what you're so afraid of.  This is a hospital.""

The worst were the ones who strode over to me while I was most terrified of being restrained and drugged against my will and said, ""I'm glad you're here.""  Sometimes I could see the bulges in their pants. 

And let me tell you, none of that was helpful.  It would have been much better if they'd just shut up and only told me what I had to do to avoid a beating or more restraints.

You specifically mentioned working with children, so I'm going to especially enphasize that you need to consider what you are and what you look like to them.  You are an adult.  A big, scary adult who works in a big, scary building.  A bjg, scary adult who can throw them around and give them orders they have to obey.  You are the Brute Squad.  You are the clenched fist and jackboot of authority.  Every time you talk to kids at your job, *that* is who they see.  Everything you say is tinged with your role as the muscle who keeps things in order and puts people down if they step out of line.  Even the most innocuous thing you can imagine *can* and *will* be interpreted as a threat or an order, by more than one child under your care, and *will* make more than one child under your care's sentence under you that much more traumatic.  **THAT** is why you should do your job quietly and calmly.

Security is a shit gig, and security for a psych ward is probably even shittier.  I recognize that.  But it's the job you chose, and you need to either do it right or look for another one.

**EDIT:** And **FOR FUCK'S SAKE DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY** when your attempts to cheer them up backfire.  Or do.  Whatever it takes to get you to stop in the moment and not beat the crap out of ""you ungrateful little shit"" or to guilt-trip them by saying you were ""just tryna help you, asshole.""  Your attempts will backfire, at least once or twice, and they will backfire **HARD**, and one thing I've noticed is that people who are ""just tryna help"" and who have no idea how to help are the ones most likely to get physically or verbally abusive when the person they're ""just tryna help"" points out that they're not helping.  You will be rejected, at least once, no matter how successful you otherwise are. Please do not take it out on the kid in the fucking psych ward who you have near total control over."

Anonymous chat with someone also suffering from mental health problems? Reddit. And I don’t have to worry about my identity accidentally getting compromised
I almost did attempt but was open to my counsellor. I spent a few weeks on a ward. I'm in a better place now than I was a few weeks ago but I can't keep it up

It messed with my sleep the First week and I had to use a lot of melatonin . Sometimes symptoms get worse before they get better. A lot of my brain fog lifted
I’m looking to buy one. One of my friends on FB says it has helped. I think she got the lighted one to test it out. And the amazon reviews look really good.
"Meh. I have had bosses like this. He is minimizing the problem and deflecting. Maybe not an asshole, but maybe...just ignorant and insensitive would be better?"

"Thank you, it's nice to see there's hope, I'm hoping that I can learn how to not prioritise someone else's.

How does one start loving and respect themselves? "
"Thanks for taking time to write.  I will think of a plan and its execution

I will let you know when I get out of the situation and find financial stability :)"
Then why hasn't she broken up with him yet? It's clear she knows he has problems. People like you are the cause of the stigmatization behind mental illnesses.
"Yeah I just wish people were honest. I tried to hide my diagnoses! Everyone is different though, I gotta respect that and take what people say at face value :)"
Yeah they're pretty strange. Sometimes I even get them when I'm not suffering from any withdrawal. Just talk to them and be honest. Do that and you'll be fine.

"well glad I’ve found your post.
My gp thinks I am developing schizophrenia and has referred me to a trained psychologist. now schizophrenia for people my age is 1 in 30,000. 
I believe its causes are a massive mixture, depression, genetic factors, family history of mental health. 

to answer your question, I’m slowly developing schizophrenia and I am 13 years old, so yes my symptoms are signs at the moment. "
"I get what he/she is saying. I believe I am a victim...or was. I was victimized by a mother who never allowed me to express myself and who never let me grow up. I was victimized by a stepfather who was abusive (physically to our mom and emotionally/verbally to my brother and myself). I was victimized by a school system who didn't protect me from bullies.

All this made me who I am. I have a hard time accepting who am and all I really know about myself is that I'm mentally ill...and a mother and wife. That is it. I blame myself also for everything I am, tho people tell me it was not my fault. I don't want to be a victim all my life, but it is literally all I know."
"Nothing will happen overnight. It will take a few weeks for the meds to start working. Just read about the potential side effects and pay attention to your body and your mental state to make sure that you aren't experiencing any of them. For example, if you experience heightened suicidality, see your doctor immediately (that can be a side effect of many antidepressants, ironically). 

Keep in mind that this med may not be for you, and that's ok. I had to go through three antidepressants and six antipsychotics to find a combination that works for me. I think I'm at about six sleep meds, too. It's always a process of trial and error. 

I wish you the best of luck! "
"What you wrote in relation to the article about taking mental health and suicide seriously is one of the best things I’ve ever seen about how to respond to people who have mental health problems and I’m a therapist. This is the best mental health post I’ve seen on Reddit. What a tragic tale to illustrate the point. My heart sank when I read the article, but I was so glad to hear you talking so much sense about how we all should respond to people who are suffering. Mental health is health - I don’t know why this concept seems to escape many people. Thanks for this excellent post about how we all should be responding to people when they reach out for help x"
"get on google, study  and practise ""mindfulness"" , drink At least a couple litres of water everyday without fail and make sure you get 8 hrs sleep minimum a night.  it probably sounds ridiculous to you that water and sleep can help,i didnt believe it myself neither, but until id got the water and sleep down into a habit,nothing moved forward for me. i got hydrated and rested and all of a sudden i was having better mornings without trying,my cognitive behavioural therapy exercises actually started  to become effective and i found more mental energy to continue as i noticed i myself began to be less negative.
all the best for the future friend,one day at a time x

"I'd say acceptance, forgetting about perfectionism and auto-judgement, and practice/perseverance (not easy at all, but that's the answer, I'd say)

I paint. I'm by no means Van Gogh, but I need to remind myself not all of us are Beethoven composing symphonies at 3 y/o out of the blue. You gotta start somewhere and hone your skills. People nowadays tend to want immediate satisfaction. Or you will see someone very talented but you don't really know how many hours of practice/training/failed sketches they have behind the scenes. You have to accept you're gonna have a poor performance sometimes, and that practice makes perfect. Sometimes I'll come up with a nice little painting, per 4 or 5 that end up looking lame AF so they go to the bin.

So in my case I gotta force myself to paint, even if the end product is rubbish, over and over. Same happened with my drawing skills. I draw fairly well now, after years of drawing. Turned the downward spiral into an upward spiral, kinda like grinding on an RPG and leveling up. Now I have to do the same for my painting skills, which is a completely different monster.

"Thank you so much for your response. I don’t diagnose myself either but I feel like I’m emotionally and physically unstable. Sometimes I wake up wanting to conquer the world and pursue my ambitions and then the next day Something so small happens (example: being interrupted, a rude person in the bus doesn’t respect my personal space, Or even forgetting where I put my wallet, etc.) and the next few days I’m dwelling on that.

I feel like I talk to myself in my head a lot and I just automatically overanalyze everything. Maybe a friend says something so innocent and I take it the wrong way. So I call them out for it, and when they explain to me that they meant no harm, I fee like they’re lying or manipulating me. 

I also feel like everyone I walk past is looking at me or judging me. 

I just want to walk in peace and not be so fearful of everything. I hide it so well on the outside which ends up draining my internal energy. I can’t even focus on people talking to me at times because I’m constantly analyzing their facial expressions, or analyzing the environment around me. 

The sad part is I am AWARE that I’m over analyzing, but I can’t control it. "
"Whatever he’s self-diagnosed himself as is irrelevant. Actually, the fact that he’s decided he does have a serious personality disorder yet is completely opposed to seeking therapy in order to modify his behaviors which, in turn, affect your relationship is even worse. You have all the information you need in order to decide on what your move will be. You can’t sit around trying to make someone who doesn’t want help get help, you can’t force someone to modify their behavior. The only thing you can control in this situation is you. If you’re willing to hang around knowing that the facts right now indicate that THIS is what your relationship is and will be, then so be it, but that’s your choice. If you feel like this is something you don’t want to deal with for the rest of your life (and hell, rightfully so), then leave. It is obviously easier said than done, but you have to take care of your own well-being, no one else will do it for you. 

Edit: This, of course, is assuming you’ve already tried to resolve the issues in your relationship caused by said behavior. Communication is obviously the first step. After that, then the ball is in your court. "
"Thanks man. Sorry for the late response as this is a bit of a throwaway and I took a bit of downtime.

I will be seeing my therapist soon, as I've not pulled round. The distance between my friends has grown to a point where it feels like I'm mourning. I've given up hope, it's become draining trying to organise any form of activity. I managed to see my friend the other night. We used to have a drink, smoke and play board games and had an opportunity to do so again. However, he couldn't be bothered. He did turn up but the energy was completely off and he spent most of it glued to his phone and left after about an hour. Honestly, it was heart breaking. I feel like if 15 years of friendship can just change over night, what's the fucking point. 

I know it's possible to make new friends. I met a girl who I was getting a long with quite well not so long a go. But the negative energy is even ruining that for me now. I can't stop thinking that it will just go the same way. It's not that it's impossible to make new friends, it's my reluctance and fear in doing so. So first thing I need to do is get back to seeing my therapist.

I made a lot of progress with therapy before. But I seem to have lost a lot of that progress from these events, I'm close to getting back into my protective shell and risking another valued relationship as a result. Thanks for the advice, I'll bear it in mind if I manage to somehow turn myself around."
"Congratulations on that amazing theory!  I believe the same thing and that is why I have isolated from that kind of people, they steal my free drama zone sign. "
"How persistent are these behaviors, namely his persecutory delusions? I ask because based on what you've described, I'm not certain he hasn't been misdiagnosed."
"I definitely will! As long as my blood work shows that I'm healthy enough (I had the same blood work done a week ago and know it's fine), I can start next week!"
"I'm sorry to hear about your sister. It's hard to watch someone struggle for so long. Is she scared of therapy? But thank you for the support, it means so much!"
It's like you took the words out of my mouth.. it feels a little better knowing we aren't alone in these feelings. I'm lost as to what to do about it as well..
"I’m saying they’re similar in TYPE, not SIZE. I’m not exaggerating, you just have poor reading comprehension.

It’s more than “sexual frustration.” "
Maybe try this free [workbook](https://my.mixtape.moe/fdfose.pdf) on self harm or watch some Kati Morton vids on youtube? She has a really supportive community.
No. It’s all confidential. But if you’re thinking of hurting yourself or someone else they are required to report it. It won’t effect your financial aid.

I just tonight wrote them a letter about it all, not sure if I’ll give it to them or not but it was good to kind of write out how I feel "
"Sorry for the other guys post. Mental health is nothing to laugh at. I myself have had issues for years with it. Feeling inadequate or whatever. I finally started taking the meds 10 years after being diagnosed.  They have helped me tremendously. Hope you stick to it and get over these issues. If you have any questions feel free to PM. Like I said, mental health is no laughing matter. Fuck those who joke about it."
"Sorry you deleted the post but for OP or anyone else reading this, I'd just say that any progress is good progress, no matter how small. Start with something that you know you can do and keep at it. Build to your confidence. Once you've got into the habit of progressing every day, you'll have a much better idea of what is and isn't too much. The important thing is that you're always working at something positive."
"Yes I have been in the same boat. I have noticed that when my stress increases I have random memories from my youth appear as distressing or intrusive thoughts. But most of them seem to be gone. I try to just stay open with my therapist about this. Having experienced heavy detachment and dissociation through my life, I think some memories were just never formed because I wasn’t recording them in the first place"
"“Mentally unstable” isn’t the best word for it anyway. It’s not an embarrassing thing, or it shouldn’t be. Tell your school you’re mentally ill, or if that’s not something you can do, tell them you’re just “ill”. Mental illness should still qualify as illness especially in cases like this. Then, seek help. See a professional so you can learn coping methods to attend school when you’re ready."
"Hey, I've been there. It was a terrible time for me when I was at my worst, and I felt that I would never get better. Financially I can't give any advice because I am still in college, but I remember my dad said that when he was going through his residency in college he had a major depressive episode and he basically had to force himself through the day saying ""I'll deal with it when I get home."" I apologize if that is not helpful. If you can't afford therapy I would look into a self help book centered on depression. Also, do you have anyone to talk to, everyone in this community is great and I am available if you want to DM me.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish you the best!"
"I don't have cuts. I have self-done tats on my belly/torso. They are generally not visible. 

It takes time to get used to them. 

I like walking around naked now. I didn't years ago. It's about baby steps in confidence. 

I got over a suicidal weekend 4 and a half years ago. Now I feel like I'm on bonus time. I shouldn't be alive therefore I'm the most alive...and DNGAF any more. Don't have to. 

You can also lie until you don't need to lie any more. ""Fell through a plate glass window"" .....or ""thrown through a windshield"" or be funny, ""Always wear your seat belt"" and then don't say anything more. People will make up stories in their heads and not ask questions. "
"I have a feeling that it is possibly OCD related or possibly a type of phobia . You get overwhelmed thus inducing the vomiting . You poor thing . That has got to be pretty awful for you . I really hope that you find something that works for you .

I remember seeing a program about someone who was going through something similar and they went a cognitive behavioral therapy route showing them videos of people throwing up . It ended up helping them . Not immediately though . 

I would even speak to a doctor about this because who knows it could actually even be something going on medically and might not be psychological. A doctor as well as a therapist . Hugs �� "
"See if there are free resources in your town to see a counselor somehow. It's important to know why you are hearing that voice. Are you depressed? Are you stressed? Are you anxious?

To me when that happens (not often luckily but it's happened) I'm usually having an anxiety attack and my brain goes on self-destruct mode because I can't bear the chest pain, feels like I just wanna check out somehow.

But here's the thing, remember suicide is a permanent solution to a short-term problem. That is why you should dig deep somehow with self awareness and try to figure out what's causing you to have this thoughts, so you can deal with the root of the problem.

Good luck!"
"“ I sit back and think about the life I had. So much to change, but I can’t go back. What happened to that kid, he used to play in the streets. I think about that kid, he looked just like me. Had a smile, had a home. Never grow old. When we grow up, do we have to grow cold? Spent his whole life looking for salvation. Never realised, that nobody could save him. So all these words, for what they are worth, I know it’s hard. I know it hurts. And we laugh at the past cause it’s how we learn. Welcome to the world, now let’s watch it burn.l”

"If this medication is what your doctor believes to be right for you, then you should definitely take it by his/her rules. That's the only way to find out how it works with you. 
Regarding who you are, I don't think that anyone is meant to be sad, depressed, or any other emotion suffered from a mental illness. You are victim to a chemical imbalance in your brain resulting from genetic inheritance. Yes, it's unfortunate, but it also gives you a reason to improve and become stronger. For the first few months after my diagnosis, I would be nauseous to the idea of having to take my medications again the next day. It passed when I realized my moods stabilizing and my sleep-regulating. Was I supposed to be manic, depressed, suicidal, miserable, and unable to maintain my everyday routines? No, of course not! Maybe you don't know who you're meant to be yet. Give yourself the chance and think of it as a positive experience. "

"I feel it fam, car got repoed last month replacement car is not working and I don’t have the money to fix it relationships falling apart got fired from 3 of 6 jobs and quit 2 others in the last 6 months I’m living alone 4 states over from anyone I’ve known my whole life I’ve convinced myself I have many mental disability nothing really makes sense can hardly follow my thoughts because they come through so quick. But we’re not alone man if there’s one piece I can give myself its that I can’t remember what I was doing this moment last year or the year before so who am I to say I’ll be in this same situation in a year from now or 4 years from now as time progresses things change sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse but the better things are worth waiting for and when I feel alone I know that many people out there are more than willing to help it’s just a matter of finding them. And I’m sorry if this feels too casual I just took my medication and it’s starting to kick in. Just think Yin yang, light and dark, every action has a equal reaction. So this tough time in your life has to ricocheted into some form of positivity. Much Love! "
"Your past does not control your future, nor does any other person. You can't always change your circumstances, but you can always control your choices and how you react to them. Your choices can make you stronger and wiser, but they can also make you weaker and spiral further out of control. Find stable ground. When things are overwhelming, don't think about the future think about the present. Control your breathing, take a shower, wash your sheets, listen to music you love, call a friend, watch a funny video, exercise, tidy up your room - focus on normalizing your emotions in the moment so you can return back to a better sense of clarity even if it's not 100%. Then, when you have reached a more neutral or controlled emotional state, you're more equipped and level-headed when considering challenging decisions you have to make for the future. Life can get overwhelming, don't let those moments make you feel like that's your destiny. Use these moments as practice of coping with stresses and growing stronger as you learn how to best deal with your emotions and thoughts in time of pain, anger, sadness, etc. If you're in a toxic situation, don't be afraid to ask for help."
"It’s okay. 

You did your best and you’re wonderful. I wouldn’t scratch it off in the future, but I have a few alternative ideas that might be better suited for you at this time: 

1) see if you can get a part time job at a dog daycare. I currently work at one, 12 hours a week. I’m not going to say it isn’t a little stressful at times, and it’s a lot of cleaning. But it feels wonderful to help comfort dogs, to help find what works for them, to finally get a dog to eat when they haven’t eaten in two days. It’s a positive, rewarding job surrounded and working specifically for dogs. 

*There’s also such thing as cat boarding! It is less popular than dog boarding and I’m sure it’s very different, but I imagine the joy is the same. 


2. Consider doing part time dog walks/cat check ins. A really good site for that is Rover. You’re picking your own hours, and you have all the power in what you feel comfortable doing. I know there are other services, especially in larger cities, that will employ you to do this for their service. But it’s less freedom. 

3. Consider a job at Petco or Petsmart! They’re large corporations that should be able to be flexible for you. You’ll see animals every day, pet adoption events all the time, and you’ll have the opportunity to comfortably push yourself. 


If you have any questions about getting or job, or you want other ideas, please message me! I would love to talk to you, if you want/need it. 

My last foster dog, another foster had to take him in when I went in patient for three months. I came back, and after a month I realized I just couldn’t do it anymore. A lot of sobbing, not so great coping techniques and rehearsing later, I finally told the owner of the rescue. My beautiful foster dog was put into a different foster home, that could help him better than I ever could. I still fee guilt and shame and regret, but it was the best decision for both of us at the time. I quit my very comfortable, well-paying job, moved back in with my parents and began working part time a few months later. It’s what I needed, and I’m still exploring what options I have and where I want to be. 

So I get it. I really do. "

I love him so very much. He’s a great cat."
When I was younger I used to sometimes fantasize about grabbing someone’s hair and smashing their face into a locker. And it wasn’t anyone in particular or even anyone that made me mad. I’d just see them walk by and have that thought which I never told anyone really.

"Honestly screw those people, there’s a million things that we can explain the logic behind and still not stop. There’s people afraid of the dark, would you expect them to ‘just stop’ because someone told them they shouldn’t be? 

We can’t help the traits that show due to our mental illnesses. If someone told me ‘you’re not in danger, just stop having a panic attack’ or ‘your life isn’t awful, just stop being sad’ it would be clear that they suck. If you showed no signs of autism, you wouldn’t be on the spectrum. 

You’re not hiding behind your diagnosis, you’re having a symptom, much like how someone will sneeze when they have a cold. "
"I would feel this way often when Id be overly high in church when I was 15, was a Christian Science sermon so the ideas were far flung out there on the astral plane.

Anxiety in particular can make these lasting disassociative feelings extend into the months.

I found it was better to just accept myself as I am (if my inner monologue is intact).  I try to dodge the thought of it in day to day reality because going that deep can make for an uncomfortable life experience.  Only some people seem to have this.


Once you level out with anxiety, its easier to dip into these altered states without issue and consider all the realms of the philosophical contexts of being.

"It could be good to talk it through. I imagine witnessing death would take its toll! Sounds very tough. Yeah it’s hard to change your thoughts just like that. Also I wasn’t sure if you’re talking about a fear of death or suicidal thoughts. I’ve gone through times of having quite a crippling fear of death, even though I’ve never been suicidal, any fear can hang over you and the more you think of it the worse it gets. I think I just had a realisation one day that life is precious and worrying about death seems like a waste of time. I still fear death and it creeps up now and then but ultimately the fear of wasting life is much greater than my fear of death."
"avoid stress

be kind to myself

be kind to people around me

find meaningful activities to do each day and do them. Meaningful activities are things that are not time-wasting and actually mean something. 

avoid stress (I put it twice because, I have learned stress is really bad for me)

Try to be connected; being connected to the community (people with mental health issues) is really important to me and keeps me well. Knowing there are other people out there, sharing their struggles, supporting where I can. I do this in real life, and online. I also find fiction, movies, and tv shows that have our stories in them (in a realistic way, not junk) are really helpfl

"swearing is a good relief. it helps me too.

yeah, I feel fucked a lot. persistent depressive disorder, PTSD (or what could still be generalized anxiety disorder) and panic disorder leave me feel fucking hopeless. i'm right there with you. it feels like life just wanted to throw hell at us with a big middle finger. 

but hey. you're not fucked. you were given a shitass hand of cards but its not your fault. you're strong and you're still kicking ass even though you live with mental illness. we are not our illness. were not sick in the head. yeah, its an illness, but just because we have it doesn't mean we cant kick its ass. it doesn't make you any less of a person. "
"I've heard a lot of stories about AA and people who participated in AA.  Fom my personal experience, the most successful people who have solved their substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or mental illness issues have been people who have been lucky enough to have one to one therapy.  Group therapy is a great resource, some are rigid and cultish.  

The medical profession still has to understand that human beings are unique individuals.  Or maybe the medical profession does understand this concept but does not want to provide the money for the solution.  healing requires a lot of introspection and guidance on what to do with either horrible memories or ingrained coping mechanisms.  There are therapist available at sliding scales to $0 up to Private Practice $150 per session.  A fair bottle of wine is $12 add taxes.   Healing isn't easy, but I would hope you could seek out a licensed psychiatrist or a licensed therapist.  "
"If your inability to get things done has progressed to the point where you are losing your job(s) because of it, it’s time to see a doctor. Start with your GP. Have blood work done to rule out anything medical (underactive thyroid comes to mind). Once/if you’re cleared, ask for a referral to a psychologist for a comprehensive evaluation to determine if your lack of motivation and inability to complete tasks can be attributed to a mental or emotional problem. He or she can then recommend an appropriate course of treatment. 

As to your last question, yes, mental illness can does happen suddenly. Illnesses such as ADHD or autism often have foundations in childhood, but other illnesses, such as depression, can absolutely develop in adulthood, either as the result of a specific event or seemingly due to nothing. Illnesses such as bipolar and schizophrenia also tend to emerge in adulthood without prior symptomology. "
"This will seem contradictory but its your narcissistic self showing, when its lowering the person will experience a breakdown such as yourself self. The vest way to do it is letting go of your narcissim and relate to other (you dont have to do anything just relate and DON'T get offended if you're thoughts are different). The most important i repeat is dont get offended and dont put yourself in a pedestal you're like everyone else and everyone else is like you.

My cousin is really narcissistic but unlike you who acknowledge the problem he doesn't. He lost all his friends in only 2 months and his excuse is that everyone is against him (something funny is he thinks i told his crush to tell him no and now he doesn't even awnser his door).

Breakdown can be good or bad its only your choice.

Good is to prevent yourself from loosing touch with reality.
Bad is to lose yourself to your made up reality (even if you hate it)"
"OK, first of all: stop invalidating the way that you feel. You are allowed to feel the way you do and to believe it is a matter of concern that should be attended to; if you don't provide it with the seriousness in consideration it deserves, nothing's going to change. You are allowed to be sad. You are allowed to be angry. Remember that. Let yourself feel things, it's very important.  
Secondly, you need to try and avoid the black and white thinking. Sometimes things are in the middle. You have a close connection with someone, but you disagree or differ in certain respects. That doesn't void the worth of your relationship. Sometimes you lack motivation. That doesn't make you a worthless slacker. Sometimes you're the life of the party. That doesn't mean you're God's gift to parties! Sometimes we are one way, other times we are other ways. Who we are and how we behave is in a continual state of flux. Consider why you might be one way, but try not to obsess over the fact. Remember it is temporary, and will pass, like a wave. Try and address your interior feelings with external action. I. E. If you have low motivation, take care of the basics and then do one or two activities that will get the cogs in your brain turning, whether that's journalling, DIY, going to a gallery or whatever you're interested in. With anxiety there's this tendency to ruminate and ruminate, to obsess over ourselves. Try and direct this outwards. 
"
"So firstly, you really can’t say, “I’m not justifying his behavior but...” then justify his behavior. You should acknowledge the fact that you are heavily implying that his behavior could be stemming from a childhood issue or internal struggle. That is the definition of justifying. 

Secondly, you’re committing a fallacy right now. You’re saying that because I (and other commenters) aren’t concerned about why the husband does this, our conclusions are wrong. However, our lack of consideration for why he does this is totally unrelated to why he does it. I don’t need to know why he does something for me to say that something is abusive. The fact that I’m not seeing this from his side doesn’t mean my conclusion is any less wrong, it’s just not absolute. Which I never said it was. 

But what we do know is that his choices behavior hurts his wife. Since the husband isn’t here to explain his side, why do you feel the need to bring up the reasons for his behavior when we are discussing the impact it has on his wife? We aren’t actually treating anyone, so it’s pointless. 

On a side note, there actually isn’t great research suggesting abusers were abused as a child. Abusive behavior as described by OP is actually more related to issues of power and control within relationships due to insecurities. But when we give abusers a way out by relating it to abusive childhoods, they are less likely to be accountable for their behavior. 

I guess all I’m saying is that nobody here is trying to diagnose the husband. Instead we are trying to validate what OP is going through, and give her some professional insight to her husband’s behavior.

Saying that I’m a hammer and only see nails is a bit of an insult to my professional opinion as a counselor. For the record I’m also an LPC, drug counselor, addictions counselor, and anxiety counselor. But I know behavior that is potentially abusive when I see it. "
Also...helicopter parenting borders on abuse sometimes. Relentlessly interfering in your child’s life and making them feel like they’re useless on their own.
As I said above the only conversations I've had were with people who asked me outright. Once I'd answered their questions we all went about our day quite happily

He needs to get over this fear and keeping going. If he skips appointments he'll never get better. He needs to let these feelings out. Otherwise he'll never heal.

"&gt;My dad is really against medication so I can’t take it.



That's pretty shitty then. No offense. Medication can only do so much. But combining it with therapy is a pretty good combination. Meds could probably help you. And that's why I asked about seeing a psychiatrist. Because they're the one's who would have to prescribe it. Maybe try to convince your dad to let you try it out? That's all I can really say."
"AGREED... same thing with college. Oh, I feel overwhelmed because of the workload and constant class/assignments/studying? Let me take a day off! Oh whoops my grades dropped and now I have yesterday's assignments to do too.

"I have some psychosomatic issue with my breathing that makes me sometimes feel more or less like I'm drowning. The finest time I had it, it was really bad, got it while I was trying to sleep. Legit thought I was going to die for a good 3-4 minutes, until I realized that if I was actually choking/drowning I would've already died at that point. I immediately called the ER after that of course but yeah, pretty spooky."
"I never said it did. I said I couldn't fall asleep at all. For 4 hours now. When it normally takes me 30 minutes.

I know I'm hypersensitive to stressors. I know I shouldn't have stressed myself out. But what can I do now? I've already managed to make myself sleepless. I've already taken the quetiapine. All I ask for is actual input not comments calling me nutty and teaching me (which is different from telling me)."
"I'm not a psychologist But I do recognize parts of your story in myself. It feels that you have depression true but I would recommend you get tested for ADD as well.

"Its cool I have outbursts sometimes. I’m just thinking of possible causes or what made it worse. I use to alienate myself due to bullying and emotional abuse by my parents, but now when I have mental issues all the sudden they wanna care. Pathetic honestly.

"No, no. It's not that. I understand your pov, but it's not like that. It just irritates me that it's like almost become a trend to be suicidal or to want to die. Or at least that's the way it seems to me. I dunno, whenever I was self-harming, it wasn't really something I ever wanted to joke about, and whenever people brought it up, it almost made me mad. I wasn't suicidal, just really numb if that makes any sense. "
"Pretty much, I just go through everything that's going on in my head and turn it into a script, of sorts, to rehearse to my councillor but I always leave out the parts which I know would get me hospitalised, I do this by either watering them down or not saying anything about them at all. For example when I'm having pretty bad suicidal thoughts I just tell her that I'm having intrusive thoughts and leave it at that."
"Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is a good novel with a theme of finding your community. David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell is a non-fiction about overcoming obstacles when it seems the cards are stacked against you. 

Also, thank you for being a good person and trying to help her get better. It's a very selfless act to help someone who may not always feel like helping themselves, and it should be acknowledged. "
"There are private and public streams for mental health. To get therapy through the public system, it depends on the demand in your region how long you will wait and what’s available. Getting one on one is close to impossible. Usually group therapy, or intensive group programs. With a doctors for meds. 

OP there are sliding scale private practices available where they lower the price if you have no or low income "
"Yeah man, I hope you figure it out. It's a rough journey and I think happiness can be every step of the way in some sort of way. But yea, be honest and try and share. I think that is a good thing. I'm not sure what the solution to anything is, but it's good to be proactive and share. You can really bless someone with some words and wisdom, however you put it. Keep on keeping on and fighting the good fight. Namaste."
"If you never had this feeling before/don’t have any chronic mental health concerns, try some intense sensory stimuli to “wake you up” and see if anything changes. For example, stand in a very cold or very hot shower, do jumping jacks until you literally can’t anymore, push really hard against a wall, eat/drink something with a very strong/spicy/unpleasant taste. 

You may just be having a foggy morning. Or, if you took any meds last night, even OTC, or were drinking/smoking that could be affecting you. Dissociation in some form is actually fairly common even for healthy people - like when you drive to a familiar destination but don’t remember the journey. "
"In my experience, Wellbutrin works best when paired with another medication. I am Bipolar so I take it with a mood stabilizer (Topiramate), but my friend with depression said the same thing—I don’t remember offhand what they ended up pairing it with, maybe an AP.

How long since you made the switch? Could just take some time, and medication withdrawals could be playing a part if you’ve just recently come off the Lexapro.

Or it’s possible this just isn’t the medication for you. Wellbutrin seems to be pretty polarizing.

Edit: when you say “living through a different perspective” do you feel as if you’re experiencing dissociation or depersonalization?"
"You'll end up like me. That's what'll possibly happen. My paranoia has crippled me for the past few years. I have to walk around with either noise cancelling headphones or ear buds with music playing at all times. I'm afraid of other people and assume that everybody just wants to hurt me. And I haven't left the house except for doctor's appointments since late last year.

There's always a chance that you'll be alright. But it's in your best interest to go to a doctor. Don't be scared of them. Just tell them the truth and they'll try to help you to the best of their ability. I don't wanna see you suffer the same fate as me. It's not a fun life. It's pretty miserable."
"Ankle to ankle for both legs, toes to upper thigh for one leg, crotch, base of the spine, basically everything. The nerves in my actual genitals are too sensitive, and the prostate probe actually does more for me hitting the base of my spine (eStim users consider this a painful surprise indicator you've got it positioned wrong).

It's a powerful model, and I'm cranking up enough to cause involuntary muscle contractions of entire limbs.

Relief lasts for many many hours. Like a good exercise session, but doesn't take up as much of my freetime.

As weird as it sounds, I've been unable to do certain work from home without this. I went through all of school and university basically either doing all my work at 2AM, doing work only when hungover, or doing it all last minute under immediate penalty. Now I'm out of university and laden with from-home work with flexible deadlines, and having to actually sit down and just do boring tedious shit without someone else enforcing a rigid schedule for it has straight up broken me. Cue me strapping electrodes to my leg so I can do spreadsheets because without moderate pain I can't even force myself to get started, let alone finish it."
"A lot of people with OCD and anxiety have tics, and it sounds like that's what is happening. But maybe it's a compulsion. Definitely ask your therapist or doctor:)"
"Alcohol and weed? Yeah fair. I suppose the only reason it feels less dangerous is the fact that it's been normalized and there is anecdotal evidence that ""it's ok"""
"And also the AMHT team are clearly neglecting him. I know my brother puts on a convincing front but if they read between the lines, they would see he is not okay. "
"Generally, a lack of sleep and working too much would be a disaster **for most**. Some manage to get used it though I suppose if you have done it for a long time. "

He's almost too happy. He told me he cried tears of joy whilst washing the dishes because it gave him so much satisfaction being able to do things for his family.
"I care about what happens to you and I refuse to think you're a horrible person unless you prove me wrong.
Why do you feel like a horrible person. What did you do?"
I find it only works for me if I'm being talked through it. There's plenty of mindfulness videos on YouTube. I'll link to one I find helpful if you're interested.
"I found it very overwhelming and, frankly, scary too. But don't just assume you're every part you read about BPD. It's something that looks different on everyone. "
I honestly can't answer that because I just don't think it's that easy to describe what feeling in love is like.  I'm sorry I can't be more helpful on that part :(
"I've put in calls to a few psychiatrists today, so far either not accepting new patients or booked through the end of the century. Oh well, guess I'll keep trying."
It does sound quite serious..  you might have to get him committed against his will. Is he possibly schizophrenic? his behaviour sounds beyond erratic and strange
Makes sense I remember I felt that way in high school because I stayed up late and woke up early as hell. But i slept in late today and feel exhausted and idk why

"Yeah I was having a very similar problem, not so much anger but just losing my own sense of what I even wanted in my life because others lives seemed so enviable. "
Yeah it really blows. It feels like this just came out of nowhere and it all does nothing but make my life shittier because people get mad at me for being angry :/

"I agree, and that it’s largely concentrated on anxiety and depression, j still feel a fair few aren’t aware of the vast array of illnesses our there.

When I was telling my manager that I was having therapy, he was very supportive but did say ‘you haven’t got depression though have you?’ As if that was the pinnacle of mental illness and would have greatly change how they would have had to deal with things "
"I can only relate due to a few bad drug experiences in the past so I feel a bit rude saying that I have had such an experience but, yeah, I have felt that. It was really horrible each time.

I'm sure this doesn't help you but I wanted to try to support you somehow. Sorry to hear that you feel this way regularly, my experience of it obviously doesn't compare, but hopefully you can get some help to make things better."
"I have extreme impulse control problems when I am off my medications, and when I explained some things to my now ex psychiatrist, she was so judgemental I left in tears.

I am on disability for mental illness and I now avoid my family so I don't have to get lectured on living off the government, or even the ones that try to be helpful by telling me to do things that I already know would work if I could just do them."
"I think that most therapists are well-intentioned.
Their entire profession is fraught with transitory strategies and ""treatments of the day"".
Their approach does sometimes work but I find the most effective approach to dealing with mental illness is a combination of the right medication and the right support group.
It doesn't hurt to keep reminding yourself that each tomorrow is one more opportunity to get it right."
"I think the vast majority of everyone in reddit will be speechless after reading this, there is no way I think alot of us can provide you with a good enough answer other then to upvote this to get as much exposure as possible!

Keep going strong brother!"
"I'm very sorry to hear that you're suffering these things. Intense anger itself can be a symptom of both anxiety and depression. I have to ask, you say that you are diagnosed, are you currently being treated for these things? I'm not a doctor so I can't make recommendations on exact treatments, but everything you're describing is treatable with medication, therapy, or most of the time, a combination of those things."
"It could be an anxiety thing but, like everyone else is saying here, you need to check if it's a physical thing first. It could be both. Either way, you need to get checked out to find out if you have a physical ailment. It could be easily treatable and your life could go back to normal. Go and find out and, if they can't find anything wrong with you, start exploring the mental health side. We'll be here to help. :)"
"Let's hope you don't. It isn't glamorous (like the vids on YouTube where kids burn something and yell ""I'm such a PYRO! Look at me!!! I Burrrrrn things!"") and it isn't fun having such a terrible thing in your head all the time nagging at you. Unfortunately, mine is chronic for the moment. It can also be cyclic, which means it comes and goes. Right now...I just want it to go. Good luck to you!! Stay safe yourself. :)"

"Funny, that is one symptom of autism.

I can get like this when I am tired and in an anxious state, although my reactions haven't been as severe as yours.
It is for these symptoms I was prescribed Clonazepam.
Have you ever been diagnosed with any autism-related disorder?
I also listen to music through noise cancelling earbuds.
I find the mathematical structure of music, especially Progressive Rock or Flamenco does wonders.
Have you ever listened to 'La Villa Strangiato' by Rush?

'Mediterranean Sundance' by Al DiMeola, John McLaughlin and Paco DeLucia?

"Thanks. I went to the ER and they prescribed the same thing and it just didn’t work. I’ve been trying for three weeks to get a in to see someone with my insurance. It’s been frustrating. 

I was convinced I was dying, and that “unreality” feeling is accurate. I told people I was having an out-of-body experience. I knew I wasn’t in danger but the dread is real. 

What’s hard for me is that any little disappointment can set it off. I broke a favorite pen. A month ago I would have said “aww, nuts.”  Last weekend I had no reaction, but it quickly ate away at my insides and send me into a spiral of anxiety. 

I sure hope I can see an effing doctor soon. "
"**I'm not going to respond any more unless you answer my question that I've asked you many times, yet you still ignore it: what will be enough?**

Sorry, no. I know what I want. You're probably confused because of the short hand I use. I could write a lot more but in the end it doesn't matter.

"It sounds like you're in a really difficult place. Something I find useful is doing a mood diary. I've got 4 columns:
 
Action (what I was doing), This helps to identify triggers

Thoughts 

Body sensation (e.g. tight chest) 

Emotion (I use an [emotion wheel] (https://i0.wp.com/hope4hurtingkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/feelings-wheel-color.jpg?resize=1008%2C650&amp;ssl=1) for this).

Positives from using this method are two-fold:

1. The thoughts column acts as a way to vent, and get all the thoughts that don't make sense or cause you distress out of your head;

2. Everything becomes much less jumbled and simpler to deal with. All these components influence eachother, and it gets really overwhelming when everything mixes together into a mess. Your post makes me think this is the sort of place you're in right now. Especially with your relationship issue.

Once things are simplified you can start problem solving."
"Woah. I get that this is a terrifying experience, but at the same time, this seems absolutely amazing. Not ""good"" amazing, but ""amazed"", ""awestruck"" amazing. It almost seems like you start to transcend into a fourth dimension and are suddenly conscious of the limitations of 3D that none of us can even comprehend (same sort of cramped terror one might get if they were shoved into a two dimensional plane).

While i have never taken it, i have been fascinated by DMT trips and what they might mean. These trips can also be terrifying for those unprepared for what is to come. It almost sounds like you are forcibly shoved into a similar experience, albeit much less psychedelic. I am still unconvinced that DMT is entirely in the mind, since there have been experiments that say otherwise: with two isolated subjects simultaneously tripping and having corroborating and consistent experiences despite having never even met before."
"never apologize for taking time to rest yourself. You're not superwoman, and you won't be able to take away all the pain and suffering of the world around you. If it's overwhelming for you, THATS OK. your mental health comes first. The more stable you become emotionally, the more you can help those around you.  ""Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself."" It's okay if you don't go back and that doesn't make you a bad person. 

And the other thing is this: you've been working with animal rescues for a number of years and thus i have reason to believe you're passionate about animal rights. The thing that's got you overwhelmed isn't necessarily(even tho its still really sad and upsetting) the abuse the animals have faced, but the amount of the work you need to do, in such a short amount of time. You feel like you're not able to REALLY be there for them to help them heal. but you need to focus on what you DID do for those animals today. You gave them attention and love and care for a short while, and that really really matters to them. It might not feel like you did anything useful, but your presence alone is enough."
"As a therapist I would say yes.  It is definitely romanticized especially for younger folks.  A few reasons I think this happens is when musicians/artists/celebrities etc. begin to open up about their mental illness.  Many individuals both young and old believe that mental illness is a precursor or necessary for creativity to the point they wish for or look to experience mental illness so that they can be like their role models.  In reality, those artists/musicians/etc would be creative regardless and would trade away their mental illness in a heart beat because it hinders their ability to create.  


Another aspect of it is that whether you legitimately have a diagnosable mental illness or just believe that you do, it makes you feel special, like part of an exclusive club.  For folks who are struggling developing their sense of identity, this is something folks are drawn to.  I remember once working with a teenage client who had their diagnosis tattooed on them.  I didn't have the heart to tell them that diagnoses change regularly and I was fairly certain the diagnosis tattooed on her wasn't even correct.  

As far as the quote goes, it does make sense in the way that some people are more comfortable with the uncomfortable situation they know than one that is unfamiliar.  It  does also seem to continue to romanticize mental illness which I think does a disservice to those who struggle by minimizing it to some extent.  "
"&gt; Shit well just take it easy in regards to doing ""that"" then.

I hear ya there. Will definitely be refraining from ""that"" as long as I can, out of sheer terror."
Crash course has a psych series that might get you started. Is there something specific you are looking for? Just “mental health” is a pretty big general topic
"I am not 100% sure, but the therapist will work through all these issues with you. I sure hope you can start to feel better. I know how crappy this all feels. &lt;3"
"I can offer lots of hugs. I am a recovering alcoholic, so I understand that feeling. Please talk to the therapist about your situation. I wish you luck and love. :)"
"I understand, a therapist once told me that"" i want to please everyone and i wear a personality mask in order to do it"", Even Though i disconnect myself from others"
Lexapro just helped me out of my last severe depressive episode. I’m doing way better now. Everyone is different. I was last on Zoloft and it was terrible for me.

"I have two relatives who are LEO.  They hate the 5150 call as much as you.  This is especially true, if they have been to the same address, half a dozen times already.

You went to the ER yourself, the 5150 most likely was because you appeared to be a danger to yourself or others.   You should be able to sign yourself out with a waiver of liability.  If you OD, seize up or go into cardiac arrest, you are on your own."
"If I haven't slept all night, I will cry at ANYTHING the next day. I can't imagine adding no sleep to hormones from my period. I would be a mess. I don't think it makes you a baby, but being aware of the things that make you feel less stable can help you take care of yourself better. Also, for me, even just the awareness that ""Oh, I'm just crying because of no sleep and hormones,"" helps me to calm myself down faster."
"Nothing creepy, I’ll give an example. Whenever I start talking to a girl I’ll slowly distance myself from every until they become the only thing I care about.

That’s what makes it so hard, not knowing how something that was so perfect, go so sour without me actually doing anything. I don’t know her reasons for leaving."
"Thanks for your response! I agree with what you said and I don’t think the quote is cringey or misrepresentative. I don’t think people romanticizing their own mental illness is necessarily a bad thing at all, I think it helps us to cope when we know this is something we will live with forever. But I think it is romanticism because in reality, mental illness has never “held us” or done good for us in any way. "
"Would like to clarify that I'm saying ""if"" anyone is responsible. If it's genetics then nobody is responsible but if it's due to development in childhood then that's on the parents, even if they tried their best.

"I don't hate therapy, it hasn't ever been helpful for me but keep going back to it.

The available data is clear that therapy is as good as or the best treatment for a number of mental health issues, but it also doesn't mean it is a fit all either.

I do wonder a bit if how they believe therapy works is accurate given that the best predictor of positive outcome in therapy is the strength of the therapeutic alliance and not the type of therapy being offered (which does in my mind weaken the theoretical underpinnings of many of the therapy types).

But I couldn't ever recommend someone not try therapy for say depression as it's probably the best option for most people. "
"The squeaky wheel gets the grease, it’s no different in mental health.

Despite constant talk of suicide and other worsening symptoms of depression like brain fog and sleeping too much my therapist didn’t really get it until he suggested I should keep on reading because I used to enjoy it and I asked him how much, he replied an hour every day. My face dropped and I said “ An hour? I can’t even read for 10 minutes”. He was silent for a moment and said he didn’t know that. After I complained for weeks and weeks how I can’t think or focus.

I wonder if being so concrete in how abstract symptoms manifest helps in being taken seriously. Maybe it was just him."
"We fumble along. All people do this - not just people with mental health issues. We bumble, and fuck up, and try and do the right thing, and get it wrong, and try to do better. There's nothing wrong with you for fucking up. In fact, the fact you posted this - clearly you are upset about it and want to talk about it - says that you regret the mistake and want to do better. 

And thats great :)  So, be kind to yourself. Gently tell yourself that you fucked this one up and next time you will get it right, and do it. 

Thats all any of us can do. Dont beat yourself up - thats just going to cause you harm. Just notice you got it wrong, and do it better next time. 

Peace. "
"You’re very welcome. Someone gave me the same advice, and I’m just passing it along. 

Big changes did not happen immediately, but I saw small changes soon after starting. The first two weeks are a struggle. Trying to stay committed can be tough, but I really started sleeping better and feeling better in the mornings by the end of week 2. My energy level steadily increased during the second as my body burned fat for energy instead of sugar. The changes happen gradually, but my body continues to change in positive ways. The processed foods are terrible for you, and you’ll see and feel changes almost immediately after changing your diet to a more healthy base.

"Dm me. Sounds a lot like me.

You're probably just caring too much for something that deep down isn't really worth caring about. You're probably going to find more consistent motivation and enjoyment for more simpler and natural things in life rather than work which at the end of the day is not what anyone is truly truly interested it. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to care too much about work or school. Caring too much about such things puts an unnatural strain on your mind and sometimes it can be very hard to realise if you've never considered any alternative to the 'you must go to work and do well' philosophy that is drummed into our minds 24/7 from pram to coffin. Its also hard to realise because work can be very enjoyable, but at its root intellectual enjoyment is not as complete as emotional enjoyment and you mustnt forgot that. Maybe it will take a few more years of hardship to really learn that. "
"I’d like to challenge you with two points.

First, not all change is bad. I’ve definitely had some relationships and people I’ve met in life that left me as a better person. That’s not necessarily because they asked me to change, just because in the course of life we are molded by the people around us.

Second, as an example. Let’s say I feel compelled to give the mailman the middle finger every day they come by to deliver for whatever reason. I then meet someone who points out how obnoxious that is and that they’re not going to accept it. Is that really a bad change? Isn’t that a reasonable thing to not accept?

Friend, change happens all the time whether we like it or not. All we can do is prefer it happens for the better and walk away a better person as a result. If you take it personally, as though it’s some deeper attack on your character; well, you may need to rethink your sentiments on the topic."

I am in no position to diagnose, do some research. But the past abusive relationships he had explain his situation, which is why i am guessing he has BPD. I was diagnosed with BPD about 6 months ago, and my knowledge about it helped me change for the better since it made me realize that my actions were justified and I no longer needed to go through the same cycle over and over (I kept acting similar to the way he is).  Bipolar and BPD can be both present as they are very similar. 
Good-luck"
"This is one of the most awful and emotionally abuse s things I’ve heard. Your mother seems very narrow minded and like she has her own shit to deal with. 

It was not your fault. It wasn’t. I am so sorry. I understand your plight and I’m proud of you for seeking help. There is nothing “wrong” with you. There is something wrong with her. You deserve to be validated for how you feel and what you experience - those things are real. They matter. They do not diminish anyone else’s life and for anyone to be “embarrassed” or to blame you
For your mental health... get the fuck away from them. Quickly. As soon  as you can. You need to heal and continue to try to better yourself in a safe environment. I’m so sorry. I hope you keep going and know this is awful behavior on your mom’s part and you matter. You are valid. It will be so hard, but transcend this. Get out of there. Any way you can. Sending you love. "
"Hi, I've started on antidepressants. In the past I haven't liked how they make me feel but I think that's because I was scared that I'd change as a person. I've started back on them and this is my second month on them. I have severe depression, anxiety, Trichotilamania and minor agoraphobia. I had a nervous breakdown a year ago and am trying find myself again. I went to counselling and that helped a little. The anti depressants seem to be helping but I still don't like taking them. I keep taking them because I'm getting better everyday. still have bad days but they're not as bad as they used to be. It's important not just to use antidepressants, I also do Cognitive behavioural therapy and do lots of yoga. It's important for you to find that right balance that works for you. It can be trial and error but you'll find a few things that work. I'm not ashamed to be on them but I was in the past. It helps me now and that's all that matter. They take about 3 weeks to kick in. I'm only really feeling the results now in my second month. Oh and I'm no different now than when I started taking them. I'm the same person but find things a little easier that's all.

I’ve been on a few medications, like Zoloft and Prozac. When I was on Prozac, it caused me to have panic attacks frequently, it just didn’t work out for me. Zoloft didn’t work for me either, I can’t recall why. But I’ve been medication free for around 5 years now and just trying to cope using marijuana. I have tried samples of CBD and I liked how it treated me. I have yet to buy a bottle of it or anything, but I would like to give it a solid chance.  One of the big reasons why I chose not to be on medication is so I don’t have to eventually wean myself off of it. 

But I 100% agree with what you’re saying about anxiety. Mine is kind of a constant. It lives with me every day of my life. Some days I have a constant anxiety I can’t shake, others it’s mellow and I can feel like myself. Everyday gets a little easier (atleast I think) when I try to recognize my toxic, anxious thoughts and “call them out” in a way, in an attempt to ‘rewire’ how I think. 

Sorry if this was rambly lol but I hope this helps :)

Edit: words"
"OK. I have an obsession with fire. I start fires (small and CONTROLLED because I am not stupid), all I think about is either starting a fire, or a fire I had just started. All this is kicked off by my intense Anxiety issues and the fire-setting behaviors soothe these issues. I had a fire truck pull up to me when I was on my daily walk to ask if I had called in an alarm (I really truly hadn't and would never call in a false alarm, no matter how desperate I was feeling) and it sent me over the moon to see the firetruck and the fireman. I walked in pure bliss for an hour after that, and it still is one of my favorite memories now. I kept thinking ""boy if he ONLY knew..."" all the way home.   


It's unthinkable that a person my age would be into this kind of juvenile shit, but it was a hidden disorder, triggered by an event that I had NO idea would be so triggering. Try to understand me if you want, but I am a lost cause. I will have to put up with this for the rest of my life, though I CAN learn to control the urges/compulsions and get on meds that will help that. My anti-anxiety pills help somewhat, and maybe they can up my dose of Clonidine again. It makes me sleepy, so I take it at night and it lasts through part of the day. Thanks for the offer, but you might be better off just helping all the people here who really deserve the help. I don't intend on stopping my behaviors anyhow...I am too in love with fire. :( (sorry)"
"Yeah I will if I end up asking her but I doubt I will cause I’ve been manipulating her for 4 years and honestly don’t plan to stop.
I have around 10 friends who are my actual good friends, but I’ve known them ever since I was 2 so we just have been together our whole lives. They’re just part of my daily life cause they’ve always been. I don’t even know if it’s actually friendship, it’s just being there cause that’s how it has always been. It was actually them who made me notice my actions and feeling aren’t exactly normal. I got kinda bored but I won’t be dropping them though.
I have then around 5 internet friends who I occasionally meet.
And then I have a whole bunch of people I’m completely indifferent to but they’re useful or it’s just, you know, formality. A fake smile here, pretending to listen about their stories etc. They’ll be gone when there’s no need anymore.

Honestly I don’t know how it went away. Everyone thinks it’s because of the therapist but it’s obviously not cause I manipulate her lmao. I think I just managed to pretend that I don’t hate most people and learned how to mimic the behavior of sociable people. Obviously it doesn’t always work but I guess I don’t look as unfriendly as before, just shy. I think though that my social issues weren’t about being scared of not being liked. I just don’t like most people, and made literally 0 effort cause I’m not interested. But then again, when I acted like I felt I got in a state of isolation.
I guess I should to the same thing with guilt and empathy but it’s way harder. I seriously can’t go “oh!! I’m sorry! It’ll be okay!” without sounding super fake "
"No problem at all with that. Sometimes sleep is a way of coping, and for some people if can give the brain a 'reboot' if its in a bad place. I would call it a highly adaptive way to live with mental illness if you find it works for you. If the alternative is staying awake and feeling various types of awful, to me, its a no-brainer, that its better for you to have a nap and wake up feeling better and able to get on with things.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was really unwell I used the same strategy and it got me through some very tough times. I have also talked to people who use video games or tv for the same reason - it gives them a break from being inside their own heads (lets face it, the heads of mentally ill people can be pretty hostile places to be sometimes) and allows them to get some peace of mind to avoid exhaustion or the compounding severity that can occur when we are stuck with bad thoughts for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to emphasise that it did not become a 'bad habit' that carried over to when I was feeling better. Once my head was in a better place I napped a hell of a lot less, because life was better and I wanted to get on and live more of it. I would have no hesitation re-implementing the strategy if/when I get ill again though. Not for a second. Because it was helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be worried about it if it was objectively causing you problems. For example if day napping caused you severe night insomnia, and that was a problem for your wellbeing, then it would be something to look at. Or if day napping was so attractive to you that you literally were not able to fulful any of your daily personal responsibilities because you were continually sleeping (but would otherwise, when not sleeping be able to fulful them in normal day to day of living with mental illness) then that might be another red flag. Or if it was having a negative effect on important relationships. Or fucking things up for yo in some other way. Cost/benefit analysis in these instances I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there are no observable objectively negative effects, and you are managing your mental health better by napping, then thats a good thing. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise."
"That sounds like a fairly similar state of perception. If I can provide some insight into what you experienced regarding what I've learned about my condition:

What you're describing sounds like Macropsia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropsia)) which is one of the components of an attack of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. It can effect different senses, touch, sight, hearing, and seems to be something to do with a breakdown in a proper gauging of proportionality.

There's an area of your brain that's called the TPO-C, which is the crossroad of temporooccipital, parietooccipital, and temporoparietal junctions (TOJ, POJ, and TPJ). TPO-C is where visual and somatosensory information are integrated to generate the inner and external representation of self. An episode of micropsia in children being tested with AIWS has revealed contemporary hypoactivation in occipital lobe and hyperactivation in the right superior parietal cortex.

Think of it as an extremely strange form of epilepsy - type - occurance that interferes with the brains ability to integrate visual, audible and somatosensory input. This area of the brain seems, at least anecdotally, to under certain conditions have some form of small misfiring in otherwise normal people. There seems to be widespread accounts of people experiencing one or two moments of this as children. It's possible then that quite a significant portion of people have experienced, fleetingly at least, some aspect of the symptoms AIWS sufferers experience episodically. It sounds like this could be what happened to you.

Again, this is more likely to occur in childhood (and also seems to be largely triggered around the sleep onset stage) as it's much less prevalent in adults, even for those that had previously experienced many episodes in childhood. I've had maybe 3 (lets say 2 and a half) episodes in the past 11 years. though more than I could care to remember between childhood and mid-late adolescence.

But if that gives you some insight into how it functions, I hope that's maybe given you some clarity on that. Of course I could be wrong but that's what sense I can make of what your experience sounds like."
"Time unfortunately cannot heal everything, not if you do not address the source of the problem. I have told myself that time will heal any problem I will have, but mental health doesn't work that easily. In fact, I feel this is what happens when you allow time to try and ""fix"" your brain, it just shuts off.

I want nothing more than to smoke and be high all day, and for awhile it was a big part of my life when I had nowhere else to turn. I have only ever used marijuana, but even that can have effects on the brain that are detrimental (especially if you smoke enough to be high everyday all day). You may need to look into the possibilities of the damages from drug use, as it can be helpful in figuring out the source of these problems and getting the proper treatment. 

Therapy does help, as a fact. Many MANY people claim it doesn't work, only because they either 1) are not utilizing it properly or 2) have not found the proper therapist. Psychological nature allows us to see that just the act of talking to someone about our problems is helpful, you cannot hide your problems from your therapist and claim therapy does not work, as you are not giving it the chance to work. Living the life of someone who takes pills everyday can seem intimidating, but it's a reality for most people in this modern world. Some mental conditions require medication to help balance the chemicals in your brain. I myself need to be medicated to be able to function because of the anxiety my disorders give me, I'm still not happy about it, but I am happy that I can finally breathe without feeling guilty for it.

The fact that you feel guilt and shame is actually a good thing, those are emotions that are rooted in empathy and it shows you want to be better. Should you obsessively be feeling them over past actions you did? No, definitely not. But just being able to feel that level of emotion is a very good mark, and a place that you can identify as needing improvement. I am far from being a professional, take my words only as some rando on the internet: But it sounds to me like your mind is running, hiding behind drugs and attempted apathy. You need to find what it's trying to run away from and confront it. "

"I once heard that overuse of electical stimulation equipment can cause nerve damage? Might want to look into that, but i would think that even that can be mitigated."
I wish people would be more understanding too. Mental health isn't a joke. And showing support can be one of the greatest things you can do to help somebody improve.
I'm glad you replied - sounds like you're doing what you need to do so that's put my mind at ease a bit. :) Sounds like life is treating you a lot better these days.

Just do a little research. It goes hand-in-hand. I've lived through this and I'm part of a community with tens of thousands of others who have experienced the same.
Just that I'm scared that they'll make things worse tbh because I had a friend who was on them and had a pretty terrible time with side effects and things like that.

Yeah I get this a lot. I have adhd which is another one of those disorders that’s frustratingly “well known” to pop culture. I never think of something in time
Yeah I have been left by some of my best friends and the others are too busy and don't want to bother them. I have been struggling with the loneliness for some time.
Yeah that's a tough one.  I can't recommend being homeless.  I transitioned at 19 (male to female) and my parents ended up being supportive.  I hope you feel better.
"You ever notice how when a cashier asks how you’re doing, you always say “okay” or “good” out of habit even though you’re dying inside and they can tell?"

You need to go see a therapist. They should be able to help you in regards to this stuff. Just make sure that you are completely honest with them about how you feel.
"I would ask your doctor if you can. There might be a biological reason for it. If they can't find anything, then maybe ask a therapist or someone in the mental health field.

Good luck to you. I hope you can find the cause of this. :)"

Best of luck to you from one depression survivor to another! You’ve got this!!!! "
"Not exactly. It's the shitty life I'm forced to live that took away my potential and makes me appear as though I have a ""mental illness.""

"Thanks for the reply!

Yeah I have definitely become more Sedentary. I’m an active kid. However, I know I could do more for myself. My aim is to make myself occupied bit I need to move in small step to reach this goal. 

I play for a Football (soccer) team and I’m pretty good. I also go to the gym. But I must admit it’s a bad schedule. 

Yeah it’s hard not to worry about it. I know for sure it’ll get better "
"We all care. We really do. That's why we're here. We know what it's like to feel the way you do.

I don't know your situation but I'd wager that your friends and family care more than you think. The thing is, if you died, you'd never find that out. Only way to find it out is to stay alive and watch for the little signs that people care about you.

Most importantly, try to care about yourself. Take care of yourself. :)"
"Yeah. I guess this is the only conclusion I can come to. I was hoping for something more but it really seems like I’m stuck in a rut here. It’s so wrong that this is allowed. It’s been like this my whole life, no help. And any help I got was biased, they always thought I was lying or “too young” to have these problems. It shouldn’t be like this..

Thank you for the thoughtful reply though. I appreciate it."
"You are already severely underweight for your height. You may already have an eating disorder. At this point, there is no being ""thinner"" just being more unhealthy. 

Please stop starving yourself with 700 calories a day, you need to eat decently and at least stay at your current weight. You may benefit from contacting a therapist. I doubt you appear overweight at all, you may have body dysmorphia. 

Get help, please."
"Firstly, in being there for her your already doing a lot, really you are. Especially when people are new to the disorder it's a terrifying and difficult place to be. So honestly, your already helping.

My direct advice here is focus less on details such as people and more on surroundings. You can try standard grounding excerises (For example, tell me three blue things in the room, what can you taste smell etc) it an alter has come out in a panicked state. Other than that, try to focus less on ""snapping her out of it"" and more engaging with the part that is there. 

You may want to join us over at /r/did, we have a lot of partners of people with DID over there as well. "
"I have bipolar ii — and before I write anything else I will say my experience is unique — and it has destroyed parts of my relationship that we’re working on but at this point may be irreparable. Now, I didn’t know I had this or to what level my mental illnesses were going to impact my life when I met him so there was no opportunity to have that sit down conversation. I think the fact that you did that will give you a solid foundation to work from and there is a trust there. It is not as simple as writing you you off for something you did/didn’t do, which leaves room for conversation. I think it’s a great start and you’re brave to handle it like you did. "
"Sounds like a busy morning. I did everything I wasn't supposed to be doing too.

1. Took a bunch of paper towels and paper in my pocket when I went on my walk.
2. Went up to my normal spot but got spooked because there were railroad workers up there doing something to the rails
3. Started a fire in my burn box
4. Started a fire in my toilet (toilet paper)
5. Started another fire in my toilet
6. Started 2 more fires...in the toilet (I couldn't stop)
7. Wanted to burn the blanket that we use as a door for the bathroom (it didn't ignite thank goodness)

Yeah I think we both had quite a busy day. I hope you feel better and have a good session with the therapist. Good luck!"
"Thank you for sharing your view. 

Being just existing perfectly captures me. I don't feel much drive or energy to keep myself focused and think. Unfortunately I'm then seen as lacking initiative/proactiveness and just working for the pay, which is certainly not what I wanted.

Since I'm in management program, I sense a lot of frustration from my mentors on whether I have it in me to be leadership material since ""I don't ask enough questions to show my enthusiasm"" and ""struggle even with operational tasks"". I wish I could tell them that their frustration would never measure up to my own frustration with myself.

I'll try to write down diaries and hopefully it'll help. "
"That is too cute. Think about why he thinks youre the best mama in the world. I dont know you, but your 8 year old must only say that because he recognizes how caring/nurturing you are, how attentive you are, how loving you are, how giving you are, and i'm sure theres many more good qualities you have. So you are all those things, caring/nurturing, attentive, loving, giving, in order to be the best mama for your child. Those strengths are a huge part of who you are as a person. If a friend were to talk about you, i would think they'd describe you your strengths, what you were good at, what you believed in, what you valued in life. Not your medical diagnosis or labels! "
Yes this is true. There is just not enough research going into this stuff yet. But depression can be genetic. I am missing the MTHFR gene which means I don’t produce the enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate. I know a mouthful. I essentially can’t break down folic acid what so ever and this is used in almost every part of the body including the brain. I now take activated folic acid supplements to compensate for this. I also found out I am hypothyroid on top of this so both of these can significantly cause problems with mental health. It’s very important to get genetic testing done by a psychiatrist in my opinion. They don’t test to see if you have depression. They test to see what medications your body can break down and if you have other health problems that can be causing it. This way they can rule stuff out. None of my previous psychiatrist even did this and just prescribed me medication that my body doesn’t actually break down so it didn’t work correctly for me. I spent years of my life on wrong meds. I also had no idea I had these other health issues until I got tested. It’s insane to me that doctors out there don’t do this right off the get go.
"Abuse is different to a parent telling a child not to talk about something. Telling them not to talk about it could be a misguided attempt at helping, or it could be due to the adult's inability to cope, it could be an attempt to establish healthy boundaries without an understanding of how they're coming across, etc. 

I think in the case of abuse you could say that the abuse may have contributed (though I'm still unsure what the benefit of saying that would be?) but I wouldn't go so far as to say ""It's your fault"" to anyone, ever, because it never is. 

Other factors that could contribute would include other people (friends, teachers, etc) in the person's life failing to help them, lack of coping skills, lack of education about resources that might help, child protective services not providing adequate intervention, the person not sharing what's happening at all, the person not sharing to the right people or in the right context or with the right details, poverty and prejudice meaning the person is overlooked more easily ... the list goes on and on and those are all factors that can contribute. Even if ""abusive parents"" is a significant factor it is never the only one. "
"This time a year ago, I fully expected to die in my 50s, probably of a heart attack while binge-watching Netflix since doing that while wearing a filthy robe was just about all I was capable of, and all I ate was cheeseburgers.  If any hope remained in my life, it was buried in my subconscious, far too below the emotional horizon to provide any light, not even from my husband and child.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward past a pretty severe med change and a lot of personal exploration that took place over several months and is ongoing, and goddamn if I'm not alive again.  All my problems are still right here with me and there are even a few new ones, but they don't seem insurmountable anymore.  The future, which once pressed against my face like a cold window, is now far in the distance where it should be, and the past, which dragged at me like an anchor, no longer seems as heavy.

&amp;#x200B;

As another commenter said, I don't know you, I don't know your pain, and I don't know who ""he"" is, but I had one of ""them"" in my past too.  More than one.  After a while I had to ask myself if it was them that had their claws in me, or me that was still clinging to them.  Don't feel bad if you can't tell, baggage is a bitch.  But I took to heart the Buddhist saying, ""let go or be dragged"".  That may or may NOT be applicable to you, but it was helpful to me.  That doesn't mean there aren't some things from the past that DO have their claws in me, but their grip is slipping, day by day.  Sometimes hour by hour.  That's how I live my life now, one day at a time, and occasionally one hour at a time.  Whatever it takes to keep the so-called demons at bay.  I'm stronger than they are now, even if I have to shrink my world down to ""be here right now"" to remember that.

If I have any messages for you, it's these: there is always light somewhere, even if the only way it gets in is through the cracks that only let in enough outside light to dance upon the walls as shimmers that hint at escape.

" I'm the same but worse, my mother beat all of us(we were 3 children and I was the youngest) and I got bullied in school too, from kindergarten to high school, and then a black man tried to rape me when I was 14, that made a huge impact on me and my family looked for aid too late. Things went bad in high school too, it was not even because I wasn't health, it was because my parent wouldn't help me and always blame me, I changed 7 schools. I started to see a doctor at 3rd year of my high school and my doctors were just playing around with us(they made me worse) and my parents wouldn't listen to me when I said I don't want to see those doctors, so I was nearly killing my mom then we changed doctors, this took +3 years of my life.  Now I'm 23 and it's been 4 years with new doctors I guess, I'm still seeing my therapist. Doctors didn't make a statement about my illness, they just said that I don't produce serotonin and gave me anti depressants for 2 years(except the first 3 years, they gave me risperdal saying that I've schizophrenia) but the thing really worked for me was talking with therapist. From what I see I'm actually health in the core but very damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

 Changing doctors worked and I got better, but real problem was and still with people, I have too many defensive strategies against people, I'm always too careful and always stressed, always keeping eye in case I leave any trail that could be used against me in any way, I always try to understand what is going on peoples head, even in the street sometimes. I worry and think about things like this so much that I can't think myself if I'm not completely alone and can't get in to the mood with friends. I always left my friends in the end. I'm too addicted to profile people and it bothers me until I do. I never understand people and I usually thing they are just stupid, I've IQ just above average but I'm never able to think clearly so it's meaningless at this point. I can't deal with stress too, my chest tightens, my jaw aches, I start shaking my feet(even in bed). I'm losing myself often and I feel like my heart gets squeezed all day, then a cycle begins; I can't sleep, I can't deal with my problems because I'm too tired, that just makes me worse and back to the beginning, cycle continues until a breaking point where something goes really wrong and I notice that there is something that disturbs me deep inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I still don't now what makes me happy, what I want from life, I can't relax with people around me, can't enjoy spending time with them. I always get exhausted in social occasions. To find myself, I need to be alone for at least 1 or 2 days, sometimes a week, It's takes too much time for me to isolate myself and get on the rail again. Then I start to feel what I want to do with my life but I lose those feelings and thoughts too quickly around people. I always try to separate myself from people, when someone like something that I like, I start to hate that thing, so I'm always deviant.

&amp;#x200B;

 Even when writing this my head is cloudy and my chin started to ache, this usually happens and it's the reason why I can't keep up with things for long or why it is so hard for me to concentrate. I'm fighting something that planted in me, for years and it's really exhausting. Not being able to understand yourself always sounds like a stupidest thing but it's my reality.

Don't worry about when you were a kid if that's no longer your issue.  Mental health distress manifests itself in different ways in different people.  Sometimes it manifests in different ways in the same person.  You might want to consider an anti-anxiety medication or anti-depressant.  Therapists are always happy to talk to you about your childhood for about 100$ an hour so you can try that too if you can't let it go.
"I don't have schizophrenia,  but I do get very rare and mild bouts of psychosis. 

Mostly it's just a voice right  behind my ear saying my name. Sometimes it's a voice I recognise, sometimes not. It's never unpleasant or disturbing, just makes me jump.

It's only been visual once, when I saw things in the shadows and was completely convinced it was real. Not just ""scared of the dark"" real, actually,  terrifyingly real."
I don't think it matters one way or the other. What's important is that you provide as much information as you can and keep an open mind. I personally appreciate it when my clients are interested in their mental health and have researched it. What I don't like is when they think because they've researched it that they know everything there is to know about mental health and refuse to listen to any other possibilities.
"I really hate to hear that you're going through this because I don't really know enough to help. I have things like this happen to me too and I know it sucks. If you ever have any questions about it that might help ease your mind send me a pm, I am a little knowledgable about it and I know for me it helps to just be able to talk to someone whenever I'm having a panic attack. No judgement here, I hope you fell better :)"
"I was in a similar boat. My mother was extremely narcissistic and overbearing. She and my father were psychologically abusive in their own ways. I've separated them from my life. I'm 21 now, but I moved out at 17 years old and was learning a lot of how to be an adult from a friends family. I've been picking up pieces since then and now live with my wonderful boyfriend and best friends in a house we all rent together.  "
Yes this is my first time and I’ve never been longer than five days away from family ever. I’m super close to my family and I think this very well is anxiety. I might need to go to the health department and get anxiety pills it can become out of control. My symptoms relax when it’s around after 7pm and settle down when I call my parents but unfortunately the vicious cycle repeats the next day. This truly is hell.
"You and Harvard are ""talking past each other"" so to speak. You are both correct but talking about different things.

Insecurity is a personal issue at its core, as you said. But it can be exacerbated by workplace dynamics. There are also people who are generally secure in their lives but insecure in work situations. I've known some of them.

PS ""Young children are never insecure."" Not true, sorry. Even down to infancy."
"You are more than welcome. 

My suggestion to you is to get a professional diagnosis though. Resources abound. Some places work on a sliding scale and as young as you are they would likely do it for free. Ups and downs are common with many mental disorders. Without a diagnosis you can't treat it. There are medications and cognitive behavior therapies you would benefit from. Don't give up. There is help if you want it. "
"You should try talking to a therapist.

You should try mindful meditation.

Despite your disorder you have the ability to think rationally and communicate. 

Being unhappy is a NORMAL and COMMON. It is also not a condition that is necessarily permanent, and there are many ways to deal with it.

Please reconsider. And PM me if you want to talk about anything. I've been around the block a few times. And I'd like to help."
"If she happened to slip back into depression then you can be the better person and refer her to a counselor, show her you are the better person and offer (some) support. I say some because sometimes that can also be a manipulation strategy.

Worry about your emotional safety/well-being first and foremost. If you are in a good place you can give showing some good faith second chance a try, but don't lose awareness and get reeled back into the same bad dynamics as before. If this happens then you know she's not a good friend to have around.

&amp;#x200B;

Never feel guilty or selfish for taking care of yourself first, especially for someone who didn't do the same for you."
"My dad is super into meditation (like goes on weeklong non-speaking retreats in the wilderness type thing) and has never experienced mental illness so he low-key tries to push it on me because it works for him and he's still casting around for the magical thing that will 'fix' me. (I love my dad, he's a fantastic guy, but he's out of his depth with mental illness and I get that your daughter being ill is terrifying). So headspace has some anxiety-provoking connotations for me, but I'll give it another try!

Until then I can try to write off my sephora bill as a treatment-related expense... ? (still cheaper than my treatment team, no matter how many serums are involved)."
"Notifying the police yourself may only make things difficult, it really depends. Because firstly, they would need probable cause for a warrant and that may be difficult to get. Also, if there is no clear criminal intent, so all this is word of mouth from the son, he has never written or made any plans about it etc. Then there isn't a whole lot they can do. This person should search their sons room first and foremost to see if there is any indication of intent, this guy can't get punished for thought crime. Confiscate any weapons in the house for the time being and maybe work this out with the school, it's likely they have some kind of counsellor how may offer services. "
"I don’t like it. 

Don’t do it “properly” with anyone unless I’m REALLY making an effort - like I want to seem “normal” or I want them to listen. 

If Im looking at you while speaking Im either trying to make a good impression or giving the signal that you’d better hear the words coming out of my mouth.

I actually think it’s because I’ve always been self conscious about the way I look (body dysmorphic disorder?) and like a little kid part of me thinks that if I am not looking at someone they’re not seeing me.

If you want to do it you’re just going to have to force yourself to do it more. Try it with friends first maybe. I don’t even do it with them - and I’ve been called out on it. I’d start there if I was really working on it. Or maybe go to the other extreme and decide that it’s important for work (if that’s true for you) and work on it like it’s part of your job to do it better.  "
"I have BPD too and in a similar situation to you in where I am struggling a lot to even walk from my bedroom to my PC because of my mind being shut down. 

The advice I can give which has helped me break the cycle before is to talk to someone. Whether it's family, friends a professional etc. It's best to let someone know; it might not sound it but just opening up can help a lot and you might find help and treatment for your BPD if you haven't already.  

I find also changing something in my daily routine helps - is there any new hobbies you've been wanting to try out at all? If not, is there anything you could do at home? Perhaps just reorganizing a desk or something. I noticed little changes for me helped me get past this before, I'm just really struggling to find those small things to change to try feel better this time. 

I hope you feel better soon and can get past this. I'm here to listen as well, you aren't alone. "
"It’s tricky. I’m very open about my mental health and it’s caused me problems but also opened up doors to have incredible conversations with people and educate them. 

First the problems. My former SO never really understood just how bad it was for me until he started going to a group for family and friends of those with bipolar. I had good jobs, was social, etc, so he just thought I was a bitch when I got in my “moods”. We’re not together because too much damage was done, but he has apologized and acknowledged how he didn’t really believe me. 

Now the positive. I’m an artist and am using my art as a platform to start a conversation and reduce the stigma. I showed an installation piece in NYC recently in a group show and I had such incredible conversations with so many different types of people. 

Really in the end no matter what, some people will believe/Support you and others will judge. 

Good luck :)"
"Mistress, I'm sorry to hear you are suffering so badly.  I hope you find a medication that gives you relief from the painful depression.  As to the possibility of BPD, I note that the human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations.

Significantly, this is true for ALL adults. This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because a pwBPD lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate her own emotions. This means that she will experience very intense feelings far more frequently than other people. 

If a psychologist determines that you suffer from lifetime BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills.

Fortunately, most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions. They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to regulate your own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

"&gt;You don't think that posting on a mental health sub calling ""people"" dipshits is an abuse of power?

Lol, no. I called you a dipshit. You're not my patient, I'm not using my position to influence your decisions to engage or disengage with treatment nor am I attacking you because of your mental health needs. You have insulted me multiple times with similar language, I'm more than free to respond however the fuck I like since I'm here in my spare time. I mean, if it could be any clearer, do you feel frightened to defend yourself because of my position? No. So shove that accusation back where it came from, since you pulled it completely out of your arse. 

&gt;You asked them, anyways.

Yeah, I did. Because, unlike you, I know what constitutes an abuse of power. Labeling someone as an abuser with nothing but second-hand testimony is an abuse of power. As an example... If I I claimed you had a personality disorder because we argue today, that would be an abuse of power. As a psychologist, I aim trained to identify personality disorders and ***a layperson would be right to defer to my knowledge on this subject***. (Emphasis for you because it's relevant in other areas of our discussion.) I haven't accused you of that and I have no expert knowledge that would convince others you are a dipshit. There's no degree or courses to take in whether or not someone is a dipshit. No abuse of power.

&gt;By the way, calling users dipshit is undoubtedly against sub rules. Reported.

So is what you've done. I'll speak to the mods if any action is taken. 

&gt;I'm going to assume you are a liar, considering what you posted was not proof at all.

It was. It's my ID card. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not proof. 

&gt;So I'd like your proof of a degree in psychology with the same first name (""Matt"") and your username next to it before I believe you.

I'm sure you would. I'm not posting my degree online. 

&gt;You supply those things and I will believe you but just continue to accept I'm speaking to someone who is terrible at his job.

I don't really care? You've not seen me at work and the feedback from our service users is more than enough to assuage me of your empty insults."

If you can access therapy then by all means you should. Be careful with choosing your therapist as there are incompetent ones out there, or just ones who are not a good fit for you. It seems to me that you are struggling with depression, anxiety, and bad thoughts, like I am. Your best bet is to look for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as it is about the restructuring of your thinking pattern into one more beneficial for you. I am starting this on Tuesday. Good Luck on your journey and I hope you feel better. "
"I have girlfriend who I am in love with, and she has supported me, but now she’s gone away to University, so we are long distance and that’s one of the reasons I have now slipped so far under.

Now, she is having fun at uni and I don’t want to bring her down and be annoying by telling her how sad I am all the time, when she is just trying to enjoy herself - she doesn’t want her annoying long distance boyfriend annoying her with all his depressed feelings.

I feel if I tell her my feelings now, she will get sick of me and leave me. "
"I would say the anxiety hit all of a sudden and the fatigue kept building.

When I first started having anxiety, I was tired all of the time because I wasn't sleeping well and anxious. Then I started seeing a psychiatrist and started taking an anti-depressant. I thought maybe the fatigue was from the medication but my psychiatrist said that it's hard to know because both anxiety and anti-depressants can cause it. Once I got up to a therapeutic dosage, my anxiety went away, as did the fatigue so it's hard to know if it went away because my body got used to the medication and the side effects went away or if it's because my anxiety went away. (I hope that all makes sense.)"
"OPs point, as I read it, is that mental illness is socially constructed and stratified. OP I think is responding to the reflex 'medication and therapy' which is so pervasive when we talk about the experience of mental health. This is a response that is helpful for some people, unhelpful for others, but ultimately makes for a focus that is individualistic (ie, the problem is in 'you') for everyone. Thats an inherently narrow perspective, and if we want to think about mental health in a way that is wholistic, we need to be talking, equally, about social context, about how normal humans react almost universally in very specific ways, psychologically, to toxic circumstances."
"When I first started therapy, I went from feeling depressed to actually being diagnosed with severe depression. That threw me for a huge loop, and the first three months of therapy were HARD. I had so much to work through and it took a lot of time to start making progress instead of just feeling like crap all the time. Now I am nearing a year of therapy and I feel MUCH better but I still have days where I need a lot more help. 

Keep going, it gets better. Tell your therapist if it’s not working. 

I also failed to appropriately communicate with my therapist some of the things that were going on and it definitely made things harder to fix until I started being honest. "
"You are me, sorry. I don’t work yet per say, but I have done activities where I can put my 100% in things that I enjoy but as soon as I lose interest and become  burnt out my activity stops. This applies to relationships, groups, games, and activities. I think it’s less laziness for me and more boredom of these things and thus loss of interest and effort put into them.

Also I just looked at the title again and laziness is not really genetic, the major factor would be your upbringing so it’s a more sociological thing. Still, it’s your parent’s fault and their parents you turned out like this, just try and find some purpose which is what I’m still looking for."
"I am going through a similar situation, not with the long distance part but dealing with the turmoil of a long term relationship possibly ending.

I have the nightmares, I wake up feeling like I haven't slept. Every time I think about the situation it I feels like I've been shot in the chest. It's so painful!

My partner did a pretty bad thing &amp; I have had to take a break to process things because when I was speaking with them it was just getting trapped in a spiral of feeling like things were ok then not ok etc etc - a 1 step forward, 2 steps back kind of thing. 

Of course with taking a break &amp; not speaking comes along the anxiety of them moving on while you're taking that time.

HOWEVER the bottom line is you have to look after yourself &amp; you have to be selfish because at the end of the day you cannot revolve your life around another person, regardless of whether you stay with them or not.

Good luck &lt;3 "
"Like the other commenter said, you cannot give yourself DID. There are people called ""tulpamancers"" who create fake alters to talk to, but this is really harmful to people who actually do have DID.

I actually have been diagnosed with DID and having different personalities really fucks me up in a lot of ways, in no way does it HELP my life. Do not try to fuck up your brain, DID is *caused by repeat trauma in developing life*, so if you haven't been a victim of some kind of trauma it's very likely that you just straight up cannot have DID.

Don't try to gain a disorder, don't try to appropriate it either.

Just keep going to therapy and psychologist and psychiatrist. They can help you with your issues, splitting yourself purposefully into alters is just lying to yourself and making things worse. I highly recommend you stop thinking about doing this

I'm also trans and i can assure you being trans has nothing to do with DID"
"My therapists are heroes. They have provided so much support, refused to give up on me, taught me coping skills to fight depression and anxiety and PTSD (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR), given me a private place to express myself, taught me how to express myself, always given me objective feedback and advice on my issues, helped me keep my head above the water, helped me keep moving forward, challenged me, given me hope, inspired me, validated my struggles, shown me so much compassion, helped me think more objectively, helped me become much healthier, helped me with the grieving process, helped me be able to leave my home, and showed me that my life is worth living. 


I did have a negative experience with a psychologist though. I'm not saying this to discourage you, but to let you know that it can take more than one try to find the right therapist. If you have any specific questions, then don't hesitate to ask me."
"That is called disassociation and not it is not a disorder unless you cant control it when you need to.

I have bipolar ll and when im depressed i disassociate a lot and by a lot i mean a lot(i lose track of everything). Currently im studying to finish a degree to start working as a psychiatric nurse. When im depressed i usually loose about 6 hrs a day disassociated (note i have not made a single error while on the job)

This is very common and since you know what is real and what is not you dont have to worry thats your self. What i suggest is to start meditation.


Meditation is feeling the void everyone has. You only need to be one with your own loneliness if i might say this will take about a week of training so be patient. During this week do it 2 times daily for 20 minutes to grasp time. Then after that you create your own schedule just be sure to do it atleast 20 minutes daily and you'll see the massive difference."
"i don't mean aggressive like going out and hitting people in the face. i'm chill too. your thoughts come from a real place of unhappiness, though. i'm saying you can use that to make changes in your life instead of hurting somebody accidentally or killing yourself.

i like video games too and at 27 i just started building my own game, designing an engine, etc. i wish i had learned programming when i was 15, but i didn't because i thought when i was older, stuff would be just fixed magically. 

now i'm almost 30 and have to work doing shit i don't particularly like because i pissed away my youth. but i'm still the same person. just older. that's been a major realization for me, that people don't really change that much. so don't wait. "
"I have a lot of experience working with folks who have schizophrenia or present with similar psychotic features.  She needs help.  If she is experiencing the onset of schizophrenia or a related disorder, her best chances of living a relatively ""normal"" life are to get into therapy and even more importantly get the proper medications as soon as possible.  

Hypnotism is a real thing.  Only a very small % of the population are actually susceptible to it but generally it doesn't have these kinds of effects.  This really sounds a bit like some kind of psychosis going on.  


Tricky thing with folks like this is as magicbumblebee said, challenging her delusions will only put her on the defensive and reduce your chances of helping her.  One way that I work with these folks is to acknowledge what they're experiencing sounds incredibly stressful.  


""Wow if I had that happening to me I'd be freaking out too.  Have you considered going to a therapist or talking to a doctor to see if any meds could help you DEAL WITH THE STRESS that all this causes you?  You know people get meds and therapy to deal with things like work stress, and what you have going on sounds a hell of a lot more stressful.  Please consider it?""

"Sorry, I've been busy the past couple of days, my grandmother randomly died so I've been at stuff regarding that.

 I have thought a lot about what you said and I refuse to be in this position five years from now, I'm not going to continue living like this, whether I get better or impulsively do something bad to myself, it's worth it because I'm disgusted with myself. The things  I've been doing in your  1-6 response is slowly pushing myself out of my comfort zone and I've been getting more into going to the gym but some days it just feels impossible. I don't really eat much, when I do it's usually not junk food, I just go off of what seems good at the moment it doesn't really matter to me. As for a pet, I just don't think I'm up for the responsibility of taking care of a life. I like other people's pets but I'm just not committed enough for something like that. As to opening up with my family, this is just not happening unless they basically force me to speak to them, I'm so uncomfortable telling people about any feeling I have. Making an appointment seems like a great idea but it probably won't happen until I have consecutive days where I can't get out of bed, can't get any work done, and am just crying, this stuff happens many days in the week but it just needs to be terrible to the point where I don't care about the anxiety.I'm so scared to make an appointment but I do think I will some day in the next couple of months."
"Actually Autism/Aspergers is treated by coaching and practice, both of which are markedly more effective the younger you are. ADHD is treated by medication and coaching, because medication does not ""fix"" growing up as an adult that has no experience with not being broken and isn't even used to functioning properly. There is promising medication in the pipeline for aspergers (EG, Fasoracetam works in 15% of cases or something), but it's also usually comorbid with secondary disorders like anxiety and depression which do have medication. Autism is just having to put conscious effort into social skills (among other things) that other people don't have to. Just being passable with your social skills will get you further than work ethic or smarts.

&gt; Why do I need a diagnosis though? 

You don't just walk in to the Autism factory and get screened. Just see a psychiatrist, and bring up Aspergers/Autism and other concerns and what your friends/family say, and then see where it goes from there. 

It's also nice to have. Two reasons:

1) Turns out you have aspergers, then: a) You know, rather than it being some anxious fear sitting at the back of your mind for the rest of your life. b) You have a wealth of resources out there to rely on. c) You can more easily get life coaching, therapy, etc, and it's important to know if other secondary disorders crop up.

2) Turns out you don't have aspergers. Then: a) You know, rather than it being some anxious fear sitting at the back of your mind for the rest of your life. b) You find out what is actually wrong. c) You can fix what's actually wrong.

Not getting checked out? Either you do or don't have it, are not certain either way, and could be harboring other secondary disorders or whatever is actually wrong. Then you hit a glass ceiling trying to work in the professional world and wonder what's wrong and wish you fixed it sooner.

&gt; Do you think I should listen to my friend? 

Well he could just be fucking with you, or you could just be an asshole not picking up on cues. When you get older, people drop fewer cues for you to learn from.

Autism has some characteristic stuff that's less known. You might check out the /r/aspergers subreddit."

"Go to the library and check out some Paleo or Low Carb diet books.  Your age is protecting you from a multitude of sins but  in 20 years, you could be a heart patient. "
"Good. It's mostly effective for acute depression / trauma / stress in my opinion. Otherwise if used while you're sort of in a normal ""state"" it's difficult to go with. "
"I enjoyed therapy a lot. Its nice to have an intelligent skilled person you are able to talk with.

It didn’t cure my problems but it did not make them worse either. "
I really hope this whole situation is figured out quickly and with as little hassle as possible! I’m sorry you’re having to deal with it in the first place though.
"I'm on a waiting list. I'm never reckless. If I can't burn 100% safely, I don't burn at all. I've got control only because I'm much older than the ""typical"" pyromaniac."

Im suffering from similar disorders and would love to talk. Im on meds again after being off for years due to a relapse and am having trouble finding people to talk to.
Is it perhaps just genuine curiosity? I have a friend like this he just likes to know every detail he possibly can and asks a billion questions till he gets his answer

"Sleep is a good one - regular quality sleep. Neural pruning happens at night, allowing all the information you learned that day to create a place in your brain for it. "
Sometimes I display better then I am.  My doctor knows me and can tell when Im lying about how well I am.  Either way my advice would be to be truthful to your doctors.
"Sounds like possible low-level hallucinatory issues, along with hormonal fluctuations that are causing spikes in emotions. 

See a therapist. You might get some relief."
Thank you! That's really reassuring to hear :) Didn't expect to need more than a couple sessions but I'll definitely stick with it until everything is stored properly.
"Thank you, it does somehow help to know that I’m not alone in feeling totally alone. Makes me think of that song/lullaby ‘When You’re Alone’ in the movie Hook. "
The nice thing is when they rejected me they did give some resources to find therapists in my area. I ended up at the hospital though and they were able to hook me up.
"Time gaps can be a cause of many mental health issues. Id recommend seeing your General Practitioner about what you’ve noticed. 
Sorry i cant be much help. Good luck."
Well that should be your first step right there. It should help you feel better. Just make sure you tell them everything. Don't be afraid to be open about how you feel.
"What is agitated depression? Is that depression that only flares up during times of extremem stress? Sorry, I've never heard of that before, but I'm genuinely curious. "
random thought: read about the objectivism philosophy of Ayn Rand (if you haven't)...ideas I disagree with that are basically what you seem to hate: egoism in society.
"&gt;I tried to tell her a few times in person &amp; tried to call a few times, but I have really bad anxiety and I just couldn't, I felt like she would be offended or something and I couldn't handle that

I think this is where I'm at now! So thank you for the perspective on the other side :) I think it will be worth it to say something to avoid running into her after ghosting because I can totally see myself doing that. "
"Do what you need to do. There's nothing wrong with working part-time to put your mental health first. Living paycheck to paycheck sucks, but if working reduced hours is helping you to feel better and you're managing to survive on what you're earning then keep it up for as long as you need to.

Managing to work ANY number of hours when going through a severe depressive episode is something you should be proud of honestly."
"I got one for $200 because it was the only one I could find that wasn’t made for children (meaning it was patterned with things like Paw Patrol) and affordable. I got 20 pounds because it was the heaviest option and I almost wish it was heavier. It does help, especially with sleeping. I just get really hot easily so I don’t use it as much as I’d like. My fiancé on the other hand sleeps with it almost every night. "
I have PTSD and my rapists little sisters showed up at my workplace about a week ago. I lasted the rest of the shift but my anxiety at work has progressed severely and it's causing me to be quite depressed. I just got back from medical leave not even a month ago and now I'm back on medical leave because of this and it's so frustrating. After years of being okay suddenly something happens and I'm totally not okay anymore.
"Thank you for sharing!!! 

This makes sense, but I also feel like “blaming your environment” (when it is warranted- in specific situations) is not fondly thought of  when dealing with depression. 

So it makes me feel like “hey... this shitty environment is probably causing my depressive symptoms to escalate.... but I’m not supposed to blame external sources for my depression so I guess I have to blame myself” "
"You're not alone. I lost my mom in 2008, then my grandma in 2013, and then my grandpa right before Christmas a couple years ago, and that really hit me hard.  The death of my grandma was especially hard since she had raised me and my brother when my mom was working so hard to support us. I would give anything to go back and see them again...and laugh one more time with them. I understand. I am sending love out to you. :)"
"I'm here to tell people the truth because this is what I went through myself. Six years ago I was diagnosed with panic disorder at 22 as well as depression  and only now I find out the full extent of the impact. I am restricted from foreign travel, I can not get life insurance and I am on a mental health ''roster'' here in Canada (anyone with a diagnosis here ends up on a ''roster''). 

I literally had no idea what I was getting myself into. I had no idea of the implications. at 28 I have no ''panic disorder'' but I sure as hell have a mark on my record. 

I am not trying to stop people from ''getting help'' but letting them know getting help is not without consequences. "
"Pick one who you know cares about you. Start the conversation with, ""there's no one else I feel I can talk to about this"" and just lay it out. If they are a good friend, they will listen and care about it. 

I really agree with the impulse to talk to someone about it though. You're not alone in this; we all face this dilemma of telling, and the complicated matter of how people will take it. Even despite all that, I think it's worth being 'out' if you can.  In some ways it's like mental illness is the new gay. We deserve out identity and to be supported and respected just as much as anyone else in the community. Hopefully one day it will be just as acceptable to talk abut
"
"&gt; I’ve never felt depressed so I don’t think it’s depression  

I do not understand this, you say you never felt depressed?  
You can not say you are not depressed while you experience these symptoms you described.    

&gt; * severe chronic fatigue
&gt; * exhaustion in my head
&gt; * head feels very tired and heavy
&gt; * numb emotionally
&gt; * numb physically
&gt; * lower sex drive  
&gt; * less interested in friendships/relationships, hobbies
&gt; * physically kind of numb
&gt; * and an overall feeling of being disconnected  

Those are all textbook symptoms of depression.  
I am not trying to be mean, i honestly can not bring these two things together.  
It sounds like a case of major depressive disorder.  

I would have suggested hypothyroidism but you said your T4 and T3 levels are normal.  

Psychiatric medication is a bit of a hit and miss, you have to try different ones until you find one that works.  

"
"I hear ya, OP. (I live in LA &amp; my apartment has rats����)

What I like to do is go on weekenders. No sure which part of the world you’re in, but I guarantee there’s something amazing within an hours drive. I usually borrow camping gear and go somewhere quiet when I’m feeling the way you are. Camping can be done on just the cost of gas, so I don’t think you’ll necessarily break the bank (let me know if you need websites for cheap camping gear or places to rent in your area).

Another thing that’s helped me when I’m feeling this way is to balance my checkbook. Enthralling, I know. But there’s just something so calming about knowing how much money is coming and where to put it. Take 10% out of your check each week for retirement, and 10% for future. It’ll hurt at first, but trust me - you won’t miss it in a year or so when you’ve planned a beautiful vacation in the Maldives. 

Best of luck xx"
"Hi. I kinda know what you talking about. I was addicted to computer games, TV shows etc. It was pretty bad. You know what I did? I said myself, if I can't quit, let replace all those things slowly with videos and articles which learn you something in a curious entertaining way. Maybe you won't believe but there is a tons of videos out there which they tapping on history, science, space, politics you will find something what resonate with you and you will start learn about world around you in a way which will open your eyes and you will be able navigate your life. Also read a lot or better listen to podcasts, audiobooks and read articles every day. I forced myself to do that many years ago. You know what? I am still addicted, but to the knowledge, I feel like I still wasting time but at the same time I know a lot, I can talk about various things and I feel like I am close to find the key in my life to became happy forever despite my shitty life. I am 36 yrs old, quite old but this was the best decision I made so far. It is a start. You don't need to learn scholar science. For example start learn about human various brain abilities and why they behave in a specific way. Or have a look how to do lucid dreams, there are people who during sleep creating they own virtual worlds instead of passive observer they taking and active role. Get interested in something and go inside the rabbit hole and I promise you won't be disappointed."
"Big difference between changing who you are as a person, and changing a behavior or attitude. Nobody has to change anything; and neither does anyone have to accept that."
"Call in sick (sounds like you at least need a mental health day or three!) and spend that time looking for another job. 

Your life and health is worth more than a job. "
Depends on your location. If it’s in the US there’s not really any options unless you have a social worker. Should probably ask your doctor about getting assistance
"I can relate, sometimes i stop and I ask myself from when do I feel my brain started recording memories because I have none from my childhood &amp; an early days at all."
"I disagree, I think this is applicable to my mental illness (not listed by OP). This is an amazingly motivational post that many ppl with mental illness can benefit from"
"I think being self reliant is the best gift we can give ourselves.

I think once you are living independently a lot of what seems like problems goes into the background."
"I think it's ultimately up to her to make peace with those memories. Would she be able to join a different gym, or maybe go with a new workout buddy to switch things up?"
I'd say its time to see a doctor and come clean about the incident with your friend. Have some scans done and see if you can get a definite diagnosis and some treatment.
"Lol when I made the account it was supposed to be for one post but here I am now addicted to reddit! but death is your friend! 100% genuine, I will not try to kill you. "
"Thank you for your replies, I am pretty anxious daily, I don't know. I think I'll try asking my psychologist for her suggested course of action the next session I have. "
"They wouldn't help me either lol. I guess Pyromania isn't in their...bag of disorders that they ""help"" with.   


Pffft. I just will go to my own Therapist and Psych. :)"
Yeah it sucks when you havnt got a support system in place.  My current doctor is recommending electroshock therapy.  As you can Im considering droping her as my doctor.
Yeah. Depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with borderline. Bipolar could be too. The sudden changing in moods is a symptom of borderline. But I'm not a doctor.
"it really depends, it could tall under disordered eating which isn't really a diagnosis but something that can be treated or something along the lines of OSFED possibly "
"Due to your age, it’s difficult to parse out what is truly a symptom of a psychiatric condition and what is, sadly, the normal experience of high school. Anxiety in social situations is, to an extent, completely average, normal teenager stuff. If you really feel that your anxiety rises above and beyond the normal, then I would encourage you to speak to your parents so that you can speak to a psychiatrist or a therapist."
"I don’t know if this will help you, but one thing my therapist will have me do is, whenever I get an intrusive thought, say “This is just a thought, and thoughts are not reality.” Remind yourself that thoughts are just that and you can make the choice not to act on them. 

If you feel unsafe, make sure you are around someone. 

And telling your doctor sounds great. I hope they are able to help you find some relief. "
I would recommend getting help. You can talk to a psychiatrist and get prescribed medication. I'm on medicine right now. There's no shame in it. Talking to a therapist would also be a good idea. That way you can get these thoughts and feelings out of your system. You need to be honest with them though. Don't be embarrassed to talk about how you feel. The only way they can help you is if you tell them exactly how you feel.
"Oh definitely. But hiding acute mental illness is about as difficult and usually unsuccessful as trying to act sober when you’re wrecked; as soon as you open your mouth you’re probably doomed.

But people are allowed to leave if they aren’t a danger to themselves or others, even while very ill, provided they can reasonably care for themselves, which is why you see countless mental ill people drifting around cities. "
"Take the pressure off yourself to do anything, let yourself rest if thats what your body/mind needs. Treat yourself with compassion, acknowledge that you have had difficult struggles with your mental health and are trying your best to find your way. Do you feel lethargic or apathetic, or just overwhelmed by the thought of doing those things ? does your medication have any possible affect on how you're currently feeling ? "
Tell them that there's nothing wrong with being on medication. Plenty of people are. And combining medicine and therapy is a good combination. You need to show them tough love. And you need to try and force them to get the help they need. You don't want to risk things getting worse. I waited years to get help and I'm still suffering the consequences because of it. They need to go to therapy. And they need to see a doctor.
"Because they have no interest in actually helping you. All they really care about is making sure you don't kill yourself. They won't lift a finger while you go through extreme suffering and get worse and worse. It's only when you're credibly suicidal that they'll intervene in your life, but even then it isn't to make your life better. Instead it is just to take away your ability to complete your suicide. If doing that makes your life even more worse and makes you even more suicidal it's regrettable, but to them it's still the best option. If you need to be held in a mental hospital for the rest of your life to prevent you from killing yourself then that's what they'll do. "
"Hey, this is very very common. I’m quite similar in that I can talk myself through the logic of why suicide is not a solution or good path for me and have 0 intent to actually do it, but I still have fleeting thoughts of death, almost a curiosity about it. What if I turned into oncoming traffic? What if I blindly J-walk busy streets? The difference for me is that when I was younger I would indulge myself in suicidal fantasies, which included quite detailed planning. These days it’s more fantasizing about potentially lethal things that could happen to me rather than clear plans. It’s just a symptom of my atypical neural circuitry generating nonsense garbage thoughts. "

"With my ex,  who was my abuser,  I kept wanting  to reset our relationship.  Go back to before I found out she was cheating and all the other darkness.   I kept thinking that if I gave her  one more chance,  she would prove herself a real human with feelings and empathy and all that. But no. Now I know different

 With CPTSD it can kind of wipe out your ego so you get a chance to rebuild yourself as who you want to be.  Better, faster, stronger (if you get that).   I am a different person now.  Still growing and healing in a lot of ways.  The anger and rage and all the other stuff no longer runs my life. So yeah,  I got a reset button. We can all do it with the right help."
"I had been diagnosed with depression for YEARS. My psychiatrist (maybe more than one) eventually started calling it treatment resistant depression.

I went to ONE therapy session with a friend to help me understand their OCD. At their next session the therapist, who they’d seen for years, said it was his opinion that I was bipolar.

Saw a new psychiatrist and he agreed.

I  always thought bipolar was alternating states of mania (not necessarily happy always but at least up, excitable, etc.) and depression. I didn’t know that the manic state could be extreme irritability and anger. That was me.

We started treating the bipolar disorder, not just trying to fix depression, and things have MAJORLY improved!

I can’t diagnose you, just saying that my anger threw me off for a long time. I also hid it somewhat because I was afraid if I revealed how angry I was something bad would happen like I’d be committed or something. "
"It's hard to discuss this if we're literally talking about ""people"" in general. Theres over 7 billion in the world. 

  
1. Some people may actually not care/are indifferent

2. Some people may actually care but handle it poorly (with a dismissive attitude or shaming/guilting the person for being suicidal). 

3. Some people care and handle it effectively (addressing suicidal person's pain and getting them help).    


The thing is most people fall under #2. We don't know how to adequately respond to a suicide risk b/c its scary, uncomfortable and we just want them to stop feeling suicidal. Theres so many people who have lost someone to suicide and live with lots of pain and regret from not responding in a more helpful way.   


  
You can't really generalize everyone in one category, even for the people that specifically ""don't care/are indifferent"", blaming them still serves zero purpose and will make them feel defensive. "
"The experiences and environment you grew up in your childhood or youth can affect and shape you in so many ways that carry on to adulthood. I feel like many adults can’t find what went wrong because they can’t pinpoint it to one thing and often believe they’re completely the problem when that’s not the case. I think we like to see our own childhood in good light even if in reality it wasn’t so great. We like to believe our parents did a great job raising us because after all, they shaped who you are today and who can blame the people who brought you into this world? Not becoming a fully functioning adult is the result of bad, poor or lazy parenting. This is not an insult to yourself or your parents. You can still love your parents for bringing you into this world and raising you but just realise this.

EDIT: and no this is not an excuse to not change and improve who you are but to know why you are the way you are."
"Only see that therapist if you're doing a couple's session with your fiance. As others have said, seeing them for your own private therapy would come with some risks and questionable ethics. You need your own therapist. One therapist doesn't fit all. They might be a good fit for your fiance, but you'll have different needs and you should find the right therapist for you. You could certainly ask for a referral though!

A psychiatrist for medication. And a therapist to explain these thoughts and feelings to. I'd highly recommend both of them. Medication and therapy is a good combination.

I’ve just started adderall at 10mg 2x daily and it’s been amazing. My depression and anxiety has lowered. It’s been amazing. Oh and the thoughts are a lot quieter.

They are still prescribed and are still quite useful but the danger again, is the addictive quality and potential cognitive failure over years of use.

"Excellent idea about the cult specialist! Have you ever heard of Carl Jung? He has an apprentice named Robert Johnson who wrote a book called HE, like 100 pages, that absolutely saved my life and changed how I view my story forever. He takes the Holy Grail Myth and helps us understand that it was actually written to help guide us in growing up. You might like it. There is also a SHE, same thing, just guessing your gender! "
"Honestly friend im having a hard time coming up with any. My family and girlfriend are so fed up with my mental health issues that they're close to giving up on me. I'm close to being homeless, I'm probably going to get fired from my job for calling in so much. I don't have any real friends to lean on, I feel very much alone, like I don't belong in this world.

"I can relate to your feelings and experiences. I am not a professional, but perhaps see one and explain exactly that. If they aren’t receptive, suggest you feel your symptoms match affective disorders, notably bipolar 2, which I am diagnosed with, among other things. Looking into some disorders like different bipolar disorders, or “affective disorders” in general and see if any stand out to you and your experience.  "
"I can't diagnose him for you, but the behavior has trauma disorder or personality disorder elements. Therapist, if he's willing.

"I really don't know what you said that would cause someone to no longer consider you a friend.

I don't really hear an argument.

Mine drove me crazy after some dental work. Just one tooth was super sensitive after a filling. My dentist wrote me a prescription for a toothpaste with a huge amount of floride in it. I didn't believe that it would help but it did. I switched back to normal toothpaste after a few months and got a huge flare up of pain for a week or so. Went back to the prescription toothpaste and painfree  pretty much  all the time again.
"That's good to know. I actually have both a psychiatrist and psychologist. They're wonderful people but I don't feel like they're quite getting me to where I need to be. 
Unfortunately I'm also navigating all of this on my own since the family I grew up in basically sees therapy and mental health issues as ""an excuse for people to be pansies.""
And I'm sorry about the anxiety you're having to deal with. I can relate. &lt;3

The only reason I know that is because I’ve been working for a psychiatrist for two years and every time the generic comes out I roll my eyes because it’s sooo similar to every other drug name. I like to imagine drug manufacturers giggling as the roll out the new names for medications. Whenever I call in escitalopram for patients I have to say “escitalopram with an E” because it’s such a common miscommunication.
"This will help you greatly

For women/mom talk either by phone call or voice messages and tell them you did something and be enthusiastic about it this can trigger them to tell them stories about the past.

For men/father just make one way questions. Because many men either only respond in yes or no.

Be creative on what you ask and playout the scenerio on your head on what questions will be worth it and what are not valid"
"i mean, you make good points, but when have good points ever convinced an addict,, i know that if i keep going like this, my life is gonna go to shit and i wont be able to get out of that deep shit ever again, or maybe i will,, not claiming to be able to predict the future here, but right now, im drunk and i feel great, so ill hold onto feeling great for as long as i can, because my mom will absolutely destroy me otherwise"
"60 mg Duloxetine, the generic form of Cymbalta. I started at 20 mg for 3 weeks, then 40 mg for 3 weeks, and then 60 mg is when I suddenly didn't feel anxious. My psychiatrist described that we had to find that happy medium where there was enough in my blood stream after my liver had filtered some of it out to figure out the proper dosage. Now I'm weaning off of it at 40 mg for 30 days, then 20 mg for 30 days. It's a slow process but it gave me 5 months to go to therapy, start meditating, etc, to try to get at the root of my anxiety.

I know I already said this but the book Lost Connections by Johann Hari was a game changer for me. Check it out, I'm sure libraries have it :)"
"Depression has been linked to inflammation, among so many other things, so you could try an OTC anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin. I have no idea if it would help, but it’s something I would try if I were experiencing the effects you describe. 

You could also try a light therapy box, in case light has something to do with it. Even if it isn’t a direct treatment of the cause of the worsening symptoms, there’s research to indicate that all forms of depression can potentially benefit from light therapy, rather than just seasonal affective disorder. Again, no idea if it will help. Just another thing to try that has a body of research behind it. "
"I agree. I put up that front most of the time. For the most part, I don't care what people think of me. It's only people that I feel really connected to that I get these feelings about. By putting myself first most of the time, wouldn't that be considered selfish?

I do well alone sure. I'm more introverted than I am extroverted. And that's what I try and avoid. I avoid acting needy but I also know that I shouldn't keep these feelings locked away. I hate the thought of burdening my friends with problems, even though they might not actually mind as much. You make a good point on that last part. I should keep this in mind.

And thank you for the offer. I really appreciate it."
"I know that during the time we were together he would often refer to things mentally that he was going through that made him afraid an episode was coming. He also mentioned that he would be in the hospital soon and the snap from being smitten with me to pushing me as far away as possible is suspect. 

It is possible that he no longer wants to speak to me. I'm perfectly prepared for that eventuality. However his behavior pattern seems to tell me otherwise but I am cannot be completely sure because I have never tried to help someone with such a serious mental condition. 

I've tried to educate myself as best as i can but there is only so much I can do without any experience. "
"I once lost my BF of 4 years to a younger woman (she was 17 - we were both in our early 30's). You can judge if you should do this, but I wrote him a letter &amp; poured my heart out about all of the time I wasted on him, and how he hurt me so much by blindsiding me &amp; going behind my back with this other woman. (People had told me to write it &amp; NOT mail it , but - fuck it - I mailed it to him.) I wanted him to know first hand how much he hurt me. It was very cathartic. After I sent it, I felt a weight lifted off me, called up some friends &amp; went out to party. It worked for me - maybe it'll work for you. Don't waste you life &amp; your time on someone like him. 
"
"I think I am banned from there. I got mad at people fucking waffling about taking medication and how they were needlessly concerned about becoming ""speed freaks"". I guess I can still browse. I dunno the people there have issues and they blame anything and everything on ADHD. I'm sure poor executive functioning doesn't help, but I managed to live most of my life without being treated for ADHD. 

I feel like a lot of my problems are unrelated to ADHD. Additionally I am bipolar, or something. One psychiatrist suggested schizoaffective disorder. There are other things wrong with that aren't ADHD. I probably should have mentioned that in my post, but I was kind of just ranting. "
"Realistically you probably haven't encountered more than 2000 women in your life, theres many million more you havent met, and i'm sure at least a good few would show you kindness and love. Theres no reason at all to laugh or mock you, you sound more hurt than anything, but it's being expressed in anger. Venting is good, but why not use some of that energy to learn some social skills or brainstorm new techniques/strategies to socialize with others and see where things go? I know that when you feel so shitty the last thing you want to do is even bother with anything, but just know that this option is always available to you if you want to learn and improve.  Good luck &lt;3 "
"This is making me motivated to go and take exercise seriously. I’m numb and paralysed by anxiety. I’ve done the meds, the therapies, skills classes and the supplements. Need to try harder, whilst also being kind to yourself and let go of perfectionism and change those core beliefs that are so difficult to shift. Change is difficult, it’s so hard and so damn slow. It’s good to keep in mind that maybe right now you’re functioning at maybe 20%-30% of your capacity. However, just because you can’t do something right now, doesn’t mean you won’t be able to in the future if you slowly work at it and prioritise your mental health. We’re fighters and fight we will."
"It must've started when I was 17. I was sure someone was gonna break in to my apartment so I slept with the light on for a year and was afraid of going to my kitchen.

Next year I was placing traps next to the door for intruders and started seeing things in the kitchen at night. I taped the wardrobe shut so They wouldn't get out. This lasted the whole year again. 

Then I don't really remember what happened. I know I was studying at uni. But I don't remember much. At some point I saw hallucinations. I heard stuff. 

I worked as a janitor one summer. I thought my boss was spying on me. Saw a hallucination attack me.

Later I thought my neighbour was stealing water from me. And that they spied on me through the walls. 

I heard them laugh and thought they were laughing at me. 

All sorts of stuff. 

Three years ago I finally got help. It took them a year to diagnoze me with schizotypal disorder. 

Antipsychotics help a lot. 

"
"First of all, I want to say how sorry I am that you’ve had to endure so much abuse. That’s what this is. It’s heartbreaking really. It’s not your fault. You didn’t ask for it. Some people are just assholes and they’re perpetrators. I was abused growing up and it took me many years to realize that it wasn’t my fault at all. 

When parents are abusive, they give us a set of core beliefs that are very negative: I’m not good enough, It’s always my fault, I can’t do anything right, I’m unlovable, etc. Growing up feeling that way changes you and I think it opens you up to be more susceptible for other people to abuse you, too. Kids can be jerks and then they see that you’re keeping to yourself and seem quiet, maybe unsure of yourself so they perceive that as weakness. It doesn’t mean that you are, they’re actually the weak ones because they feel the need to attack someone else to boost themselves up. 

Going to therapy really helped me understand how my upbringing impacted me the way that it did. If you aren’t in a place where you can or want to go that route, I would look up self-compassion and also how to change core beliefs. I hope this helps some! "
"Hallucinations dont necessarily mean schizophrenia. It can be a few different things or a one episode occurrence. Either way, hopefully you're able to find a psychiatrist."
Honestly the best help for intrusive thoughts/OCD is therapy. Are you seeing a therapist in addition to your psychiatrist? It’s difficult to manage OCD with meds alone.
"I had a very similar experience with CBT. I just couldn’t engage with it and I didn’t feel like my doctor gave a shit so I didn’t open up.

Gave up after 4 sessions."
"I want to ask when the last time you were a teen was. Teens today do not understand humour beyond ""relatable"" facebook posts. Show them Monty Python and they won't get it."
I would seek out therapy. They can help you work through these feelings and give you tools to help yourself when you need to. Good luck to you and I hope the best for you!
"If a child that age even has the idea, it must have picked it up somewhere and something must be going horribly wrong. Might be worth contacting child protective services."
"It is never a bad idea to keep a journal or log of anything health related. Absolutely, jot these things down as they occur. That will be very helpful to your therapist.  "
I’ve been on it for a couple of years without any side effects. You may just be anxious about starting something new it’s probably too early to feel anything from it.
"Lock the gun up even better than it already is.

Get your son to a mental health professional.

Spend a lot of time with him, just doing stuff together that he enjoys.  

"
One person's choice to commit suicide is always that person's choice.  No one else made that decision for them.  You cannot blame Wendel because Graziela killed herself.
"Personally, the daylio app works best for me in monitoring my moods and activities for my bipolar cause like you I tend to come off as “too functional” to therapists. "
"Same here! I was getting treated for BPD for years and it was the most unproductive shit ever, when I got diagnosed as BPII and proper meds it was a like coming up for air"
Thank you! I can't say how thankful I am for the replies and just to know that I'm not the only one going through it. Hearing other people's experiences really does help.
"Thank you. 

I have experienced the passing of family members and friends before, just this one is so different. He was my Person. I just don't know who to talk to now... "
"Thanks.
Depression is really setting in tonight. I feel like I can't do anything right. I post here and I deleted it because I feel horrible for whining again. :( I dunno."
"They criticize bullshit, such as how I shave my face and then I feel bad about doing it. It's out of my control. Those people just choose to put me down for this non-sense"
"Yeah I can relate to how you feel. I feel stuck in a constant cycle of depression, anxiety and misery. Are you going to therapy right now too? Or are you only taking meds."
"Yes I'm in Ontario. 

I know when I was a teen psychologists were covered until OHIP or whatever government thing. (Not insurance). I just assumed it was the same over 18."
"You poor, kid. :'( Much Love and Infinite Mojo to ya.' I know we could all use a good bit of it sometimes. I'm right there with you. You kinda making my eyes a little wet."
You will need a letter of support from your therapist. But it's in your favor that you're seeking treatment and honestly working through and managing your mental illness.
"YouTube videos. I know people say don’t use phones, but I like to watch gaming videos and chill. Sleeping thinking about the games instead of my life is relaxin I guess "
"&gt; He can walk into a gun store and walk out with a gun in 20 minutes now if he so desires.

Its a real problem.  Again, I have two relatives in law enforcement and they say, ""Nobody talks abut mental illness UNTIL there is a body count"". 

There is probably no solution to your wife's dilemma.  You need to keep her and yourself safe and she needs to learn to deal with the guilt.  This is probably not going to end well. 

"
"Guess I shouldn't be surprised, based on your post history, that you'd take someone mentioning that they're worried about their *school* schedule being disrupted and turn in into a chance to ignorantly and arrogantly rail at them for being a materialist, and *then* use as an excuse to scream at them for being a sinner who hates your god just because they are mentally ill.  That is a connection that exists only in your head."
"Hey, thanks for reading my post!

I have spoken to him about it, he includes me in conversation and even ""bigs me up"" with his friends but they are not interested. Which I am okay with. Some bring their partners but they are either a lot younger or older than me but that's just once in a blue moon. 

I have been trying to look for a hobby to try and relate and make new friends. 

Thank you from the other side of the pond :)"
"I used to have this feeling all the time. Especially when I was in the shower alone with my thoughts.  I used to feel weird and started to feel a panic attack coming. I don't have that feeling as much anymore. But my best advice would be to socialize more. Feel more present in your life. I don't exactly know how i got over it. But i think getting a customet service job,  and interacting with humans played a huge part of it."
"It's likely the same thing, the mental health services in your area. I had a bad experience with them last year but like you felt like there's no options hence why I self referred again. There's resources on the mind website and should be in the website for your local mental health services too, although I know how frustrating it can be to be told look on the website. If you need someone to talk to feel free to message me. "
"I’d rather “make things difficult” than turn on the TV and see another school shooting. Better to be safe than sorry. 

If the OP wasn’t concerned they wouldn’t have posted on here. Maybe I’m a “liberal coastal elite” from California who is anti-gun, but if my concern saves a life or even the threat of someone losing their life...I’ll do what I just did by contacting the authorities every day of the week. "
"Not for everyone though. Some people including me get highly paranoid after smoking weed which can result in a really bad trip. I know weed calms you down but it just doesn't work for me that way, My thoughts are highly amplified and filled with paranoia. I have read articles which say smoking weed with high amount of CBD will help but I haven't tried it myself. There are pure CBD oils which help with anxiety.

Edit - Typo."
"That’s a good point...I think it’s a good idea because like I said certain stages of our lives bring about different challenges; even our brains and bodies literally change. Plus life experience, maturity, hormones, aging. These are good reasons to have a sub to get/give support to people in your age groups. I don’t know about you but I always want to know the age/sex of the OP. It helps me put myself in their shoes. "
"This doesn’t  totally relate to you, but i just left my ex, i packed all my shit up while she was at work and left because it was so toxic. I luckily have family willing to help me but i did have to fake it for a while to save up money to move from Denver back to New York , and I’m no relationship expert but if i can do it you can, I’m building my life back up around myself instead of some one else and it feels great "
"Well, I'm glad that you feel that way. I can only imagine how hard that is. Compulsion are so much more complicated than people think. People always say, 'Well, why don't you just stop?' but it's very complex. I've had Trich for about 20 years and they only think that helps is time and hard work. Not to worry about venting. Venting sometimes can be good for the soul and can help move on. Thank you very much and vice versa! "
"And I mean  are you younger, older? I have nothing against that a d would gladly do it, in fact could be aiming too high, but my bro for example, who had eight years of forced school after my dad went before having to be an adult, actually went to university ( I had to drop out cuzco my dad was on his deathbed when school started freshman year and dead two and a half weeks later) finished and at 22 is making 63k a year a state away.

O.a d forgot.to mention I live right next to less tha  a mile.from a major university, kitchen work is hard to find since they have 50000 kids coming in each year willing to take whatever and graduating 50000 each year to take all the good jobs "
"And make them readily available for when you do that task too. Take them with coffee? Leave them by the pot. Take them after brushing teeth? Leave them with the toothbrush. Make it as easy as you can. Get a bottle that takes minimal effort to get into, if you don't have to worry about other people abusing it. Mine are in a button-release flip-top pill case. Even my general purpose pain meds I only take once in a blue moon are in a case with a sliding 'door' closure, because fuck pill bottles.

(It's a ""LazyMe Decorative Pill Box"" if you want to look into that on Amazon. It's pretty roomy and the 'door' has never accidentally slid open in transit, despite living in my purse.)"
"I was diagnosed with anxiety induced depression but i dont feel sad at all. I get anxiety, and disassociate and isolate myself and ignore the outside world and have the extreme urge to just hide. When its really bad i get urges to hurt or kill myself but its not with sad thoughts, they usually just pop up and ill randomly intensely feel like crashing my car, smashing my head on the counter, teeth pulling, or cutting myself open. I dont feel sad at all, i feel like i have to try really hard to control myself and i get these craving like impluses when i get stressed out. Usually after spending lots of time around people. Im tired a lot too. I love sleep, i could sleep forever "
"I would take 25 mg and call doctor in the morning. Should definitely take it if you've been taking it, even if it's not 50mg your brain is adjusting and disturbing the chemical balance that is already unbalanced can make you feel worse.

It was hard for me to get off Zoloft, I experienced brain zaps and was very uncomfortable.

I was severely depressed and was questioning reality and had strange paranoia and couldn't answer the door if someone were to knock. Zoloft turned that off and with therapy I was able to get my head together. 

They can taper you off and try something else as well. Prozac kinda gave me an energy comfort feeling, where Zoloft made me more robot like.

"
"One of the most important things you can do is just listen. Don’t try to fix anything, you can’t and trying to can sometimes make things worse. I have struggled for 16 years with depression and anxiety as well as panic attacks. Remind him that you love him and are there for him.  Send him random texts telling him you love him. Ask him how he is doing. Checking in with him and reaching out and reminding him that he can talk to you and you are a safe place for him can make all the difference. Often times it can feel daunting to reach out to others and having my husband check in with me helps so much.  If you have any questions please feel free to send me a private message."
"When i see someone struggle or make a mistake it makes it easier for me to open up because since they made a mistake so can i. 

I think i misspoke when i was writing about dating. I wanted validation for myself to see that i can be someone who can date. I’ve been teased about my sex life and i dont want people to see me as someone who is homosexual. Nothing against homosexuality i just dont want people to think that because im not. I feel pressured to find someone and i’ve tried to find someone. My self-confidence in myself is just so low after getting stood up 3 times in a row. 

You’re right i should go back there and give them their $60. 

Thanks for the response. "
"While it seems unethical and unprofessional that they would tell him that no one cares about him (and if that’s the case someone should complain to the hospital) but involuntary holds are legal in the case of someone being a danger to themselves or others. Being in a windowless room initially is not uncommon, before they can get the person to the psych unit where there are more safety precautions regarding jumping/harming oneself with glass. If your brother is a minor, your parents should be able to see him during the unit’s visiting time, and speak with his treatment team. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, I know it must be scary to not know what’s going on. "
"I'm sorry that you're going through all of this. It sounds really hard, but I'm proud of how strong you are. It's great that you are seeing a therapist, I'm seeing one myself. I also have anxiety problems. For me it's mainly meeting new people. I can understand feeling paralyzed. Sometimes when I'm asked questions my brain shuts off and I can't even think let alone get a sound out. Something that has been helping me is practicing conversation. I know it sounds weird, but it's like the repetition somehow makes it easier. I practice scenarios out loud, all the time. My boyfriend helped me initially, asking me things at home. Now I practice in my car when I'm on errands or in the mirror. Interviews are the worst for me. So I practice different scenarios over and over until I feel like I sound ""normal"". It definitely made me a bit more comfortable. I hope this helps you in some way. If you need someone to talk to, I'll be here (:"
"You have to focus on what you can control, because trying to control the things you can't will only make you feel worse. You can't control how your family reacts to you, but you can control your choices in finding other people to rely on and in seeking your own help. You're 22, which means you can go find a therapist. Many of them take health insurance, and if you don't have health insurance, you can apply for medicaid. You can also control your environment. You can go outside and take a walk when you feel you need space from your family. 

Acknowledge the things you know feel bad, and stop trying to force them to feel good. If you know that talking to your mom is going to lead to eyerolls and invalidation, don't keep attempting it. Go find a different support to talk to. If you know that constantly seeking your family's support is going to lead to disappointment, stop seeking it. At a certain point, you're hurting yourself. "
"You are not a ""miserable shitty person."" How do I know? First, because there are very, very few truly ""bad"" people out there, a label I would reserve for those who commit murder and so forth. And second, if you really were a bad person, you wouldn't worry that you were one.

You are not a bad person. You have an illness. 

But the difference between physical and mental illness, and why depression is so insidious, is because it attacks the underpinnings of our psyches. It makes us question ourselves at a fundamental level, as it is doing for you. 

You are also in a very stressful time of life. You have just had a child, which plays havoc on your body, and your hormones are likely going all over the place. You have three kids, which is a handful. You are probably also not getting enough sleep. 

Be kind to yourself. This isn't your fault. 

If your psychiatrist isn't helping, try a different one. There is a matter of ""fit"" here and some approaches work better for some people.

If you have not looked into meditation and mindfulness practice, ask your doctor about that. This is a great place to start: https://www.amazon.com/Mindful-Way-Through-Depression-Unhappiness/dp/1593851286"

"For me as a 34 year old who has suffered with depression, (etc.) since the age of 14, I unfortunately know just how real depression is for young people. To suggest that the sub was created because people over 30 think their illness is “worse” than younger people is hurtful, and totally missing the point. 

Before the age of 20 I had been in the psych ward 3 times, been put on multiple different medications, shipped around to family members houses, been through trauma. I know how much hurt these people are feeling. It’s valid and I don’t think anyone in the sub would ever want to invalidate their issues. They were probably once their own. 

The difference, for me, is several things. First, about 75% of Reddit users are under 25 years old. MANY are living at home with parents, going to school, navigating through relationships and jobs, and just dealing with specific issues of the current generation. 

So, when I’m browsing through mental health communities on Reddit, it’s not that I can’t relate to the core emotions, but the specific struggles I haven’t related to in quite a while. And since 75% of the people are closer to their age, they’ve got plenty of people that can give them great advice. 

But maturity levels change as we get older and that’s just a fact. Life’s daily issues are different for a 40yr vs a 17yr old. 

You ask why those over 30 need their own space? Simply just so you know the people there are over 30 that’s all.

I would just like to reiterate to everyone who reads your comment that *the sub is not meant to exclude younger people because their mental illness is not as bad.*

I hope somebody other than me comes to the rescue here and explains it better; I’m just a little annoyed that people think like this and it even has to be explained. I’m offended that they’re offended and believe that older people think they’re illness is worse, and that they shouldn’t want their own sub. "
"Wow that is fascinating. The description of bugs crawling under the ribcage is a perfect description of the sensation I get. It literally feels like that for me, if the bugs were just extremely tiny and numerous, and each pumped full of energy. And that's even more fascinating how it also gives you the irritability and anger along with the discomfort. You may as well be describing me.

Yes for me anxiety doesn't need to be the precursor. It certainly feels like the feeling in the chest comes first for its own reasons, and then the anxiety comes as a response to being in such a wound up state.

Yes fucken exact same story here regarding the self-criticism bringing on the reaction. These days as the self-critical emotions arise I can literally feel at the exact same time the onset of the physical reaction; the swelling at the bottom of my chest and the blood rushing up my neck all being spurred on by a single thought. And my response is also an enormous amount of avoidance. Usually I get this when I am by myself and it comes on, while if I am with people when it appears then it shows itself as aggression and short patience, which then turns to avoidance and cynicism again once I'm by myself again.

Sorry if I'm just rambling, but I'm just so fascinated that I am not alone with this and someone else actually knows what I'm talking about! Often I feel like I am just turning insane.

So it could be as simple as a physical response from a vitamin deficiency then? I see that as excellent news, since it at least implies a possible cure. Could you tell me what sort of effect you found from b12 and folic acid? And do you know of anything else nutrition-wise that could lead anywhere for us?

I forgot to say I'm so sorry you have to go through this with me. And thank you so much for sharing your story with me! I can't tell you how much of a weight lifted off my shoulders it is to know that this is a real thing that can actually be addressed."
"About the girl thing, I really want to act and actually change something myself in my own life. About my parents, I will wait more before I am actually able to do something"
"Awwww shucks. I'll be honest in that I've never suffered from an ED, though self-image and depression are more up my alley(?). I feel like my wording has now abandoned me. "
"Flames. Heat. Smoke.  


I am not even kidding...it is a scary thing.  


Most of the time, I just see the world around me, but lately, it has been just a huge forest fire."
I'm not a mental health nurse but I'm a residential counselor at a group home for people with severe bipolar or schizophrenia. Is your question anything I could help with?
"I've dealt with insecurity in my life too. So I know how he feels. But he needs help. That's the bottom line. And if he truly cares about you, you won't become irrelevant. "
It depends on the counselor. A counselor DOES need to diagnose you with something in order to bill insurance though.  There are pros and cons to both ends of the argument.
"Literally only just saw this, the base diagnoses was anti-social personality disorder in my though i have been told that i may also have other stuff that needs to be tested"
Medicaid should cover some mental health services. But the only way you'll know for sure is to call them and ask. Both of them. The Medicaid Office and the Doctor's Office.
NO problem. :) You can private chat me anytime and I can fill you in on all my gory details if you want a good fairy tale ha ha. I wish. Good night. I am going to sleep. :)
"Read ""The Body Keeps the Score"". I just listened to it on audible and it's changing my life and Outlook and understanding of mental health (esp when therapy 'doesn't work')"
"Thank you, I really appreciate your support �� 

It is like am falling down a pit and trying to decide to let go or to keep trying to get out, which could never end :( "
"Thanks, I'm just a bit afraid to swap Prozac for another drug in case my OCD ramps up again. I think you are right though that I need to talk to my doctor about my options."
"That's exactly it!  I definitely used to have derealization/depersonalization, I didn't know this was also a symptom of it. And yes, I do have a lot of anxiety issues too.."
That’s kind of the issue. They are just drivin aimlessly and don’t seem to have a plan for how to get back home. Drove from the East coast to the West Coast in 4 days.
The one my sister did was called betterhelp. She said it was good and they also did group sessions as well. She liked albeit it was expensive. I hope you find what you need
"The way I see it, whether you're right or not, you have no choice but to do the best you can and to be the best you can be. You have nothing to lose even if you're a loser."
"Yeah definitely but I'll still have like a really intense panic attack
I've only passed out from them a couple of times but I think it'll happen again if I leave the house "
Yes!! Don’t you wish a sign above your head said “legit G.A.D. please gtfo” edit: also you are my twin im just not ready to be good yet. It’s nice to know you can.

" Self care is a gentle way to inadvertently remind your brain  that you're important,  loved, and nurtured.  

Turn off the lights, get your softest towel,  turn on your Pandora classic music, drink some wine or coffee in the shower, get your comfiest pjs for afterward,  make it a sensory haven and take your time.  

You can and are allowed to enjoy self care during depressive bouts regardless of what the media says. :)

"As everyone else has already said, good on you for realizing you need help and finding ways to do that. Having CPS In your life does not automatically mean they'll take your child away from you and it's going to look way better if you initiate the process through therapy or whatever. Not to be crass but it's definitely better than having an ambulance or the coroner show up after you've gone too far one day. You can do this. "
"Don't ever be afraid to post here. Goodness knows, we all have experiences that can help you figure out why you feel a certain way. I burst out into tears constantly, but then again, I am just a hot mess most times and super-sensitive. You really SHOULD go see a doctor about it . It may be physical (who knows?) or at least the doctor can point you in the right direction. :) Feel better, and I am sending you tons of huggles! "
"Hey OP, look for the little things that make you happy. Set goals for yourself and not necessarily force yourself to be better but at the same time don't allow the past to control you.

I wish you luck and hope for the best. Probably not the best person to give advice about this sort of stuff though so you may want to see a therapist too if you need someone to talk to but don't have anyone.

Good luck! We're rooting for you!"
"I don’t think there can be any benchmark to depression, it’s all relative. No one person can be the most depressed. I’m not trying to put you down though btw, I’m sorry you’re feeling crap, I’ve gone through terrible periods of it myself for over 20 years now so know where you’re coming from. There is light at end of tunnel and you will find it at some point. If you ever need to talk to anyone I’m listening. "
I love my dog a ton and hoping to get him registered as a therapy dog. It's actually super easy. Check out ustherapydogs.com or therapydogregistration.com or something like that. They have packets that get you the vest and tags and information to have them registered with the us gov. For a cost. At the very least they give you a generic letter that you can fill out and have your therapist sign off to have the dog registered.
"Please seek help. Please. Don’t give up on your family. You have the power to change. The fact that you can recognize these patterns in yourself is more than most people can do. 

Growing up my dad was similar to what you are describing. And I wish he would have sought help to better manage his emotions and anger towards me. You can make this better... you can make yourself better! You just have to believe that you can!!! "
"Thank you friend ❤. Ironically, I'm also extremely wary of self diagnosis. I'm typically the one telling, ""PLEASE GO TO A PROFESSIONAL TO BE DIAGNOSED!"" when someone tries diagnosing themselves with something they recently heard. Only reason I'm even posting this is because I know I'm showing so many symptoms of bipolar disorder, but after repeatedly being ignored by professionals I'm just beginning to think I'm delusional"
"You have a lot going on for sure. It's okay to be overwhelmed. Being overwhelmed doesn't mean you're still not doing a good job. Social work takes a toll on our mental energy I think. It's more than just doing a job, you have to think so much about things that aren't tangible. I'm a full time social worker and in grad school too. It's a lot to manage. Do you like your work? What area are you in? (I'm in crisis intervention) "
"I found that Zoloft works best for me because it brings a level of calmness for me. I've tried Welbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac but they've all caused some wicked side effects for me. I was on 100mg of Zoloft before getting pregnant again and have since gone off of all my medications, I noticed a huge difference now in my anxiety but I'm in cognitive behavioral therapy and that is helpful. 

Unfortunately, I've suffered from bipolar depression and anxiety for over 20 years now, I've figured out that there is no such as a cure all medication. You sort of have to try it and see if it works or doesn't work. Best of luck to you and feel free to message me if you have any questions. "
"What the ...??? The Internet may be a bad idea to ONLY get advice (you really need to see a professional face to face if you have an issue) but venting online to people who may understand you and to whom you can get your feelings out to is NOT A BAD IDEA. It helps to find other people who can say ""hey, I have been there and you can talk to me anytime"". I know I am suffering from a pretty ""rare"" thing (understudied is more like it) and there is nobody (not even a Psych!) who understands it. Talking to people here (anonymously) is better for me because I also have anxiety and don't like face to face meetings. So please don't say stuff like this. It isn't helpful and isn't true."
"Wow. Your English is better than some of the native English speakers I know! Congrats to you on learning the language so well. That shows me that you are intelligent and driven. Sounds like you have a little bit of depression going on there (I can't say for sure because I can't diagnose over the internet) and maybe possible other issues too. The only thing I can suggest is to go talk to a professional who can diagnose you and get you back on the right track. I am sorry about your parents too. My mom was TOO overprotective and never let me grow up, and now I am a 47 year old adolescent basically. If you need to talk, my messages are always open for anyone. :) Good luck to you!"
"First of All. Don'try and beat your feelings. I know that it's really cliche and WAY WAY **WAY**  harder than just saying it but, try to accept them. Try not to push them away but allow yourself to feel them. It's simple but simple doesn't mean it's easy. (try Meditation as a way to practice acceptance. If you have the money give headspace a shot) 

2 Have you talked with your SO about it? Maybe they also want to send more time with you but don't think you would enjoy it with their friends or smth like that. But if you talk with them about it try not to make her look like the bad guy. None of you two has done anything wrong as far as I can deduce from just this Post. 

3 Intellect doesn't equal control over your body. You will probably never be able to control the way your body reacts to stuff the instance that things happen. Which is why number 1 is probably the most important thing on here. The only thing you can do is to accept the feelings, aknowledge them and do things I spitze of feeling them. Only this way you will be able to change your bodies reaction to them not sending time with you in the future. Don't expect that to happen over night though, it will take some time."
"I’m in Oklahoma. I’m not sure if we have life insurance or anything. I think we do. My mom only goes or takes us to the hospital if it’s emergency, so I’ve never had a yearly check up or anything. My mom’s a sweet lady and isn’t a tweaker (yet), but she’s extremely irresponsible. My dad literally cane from dirt floors/no food/getting molested and beaten by his family, so he’s a bit of rougher a man, if that makes sense. So I feel like if I told him all this he would tell me his life story and basically call me a pussy that doesn’t have a real reason to be this way. And then I’d be left with all my insecurities out in the open, and just that thought makes me so uncomfortable and anxious. My town doesn’t have a police force because it’s too poor and the closest decent emergency room is an hour long drive through the mountains, so if I attempt it there’s a good chance I’m just gonna suffer for awhile in my floor and then pass on. Not an ideal way to go, I suppose. 

I’m not honestly sure what all my options are I guess. I wish I could do it all myself and anonymously so my parents wouldn’t have to know, but I’m broke and it would be a big hassle. "
"No. I've read about ADHD, and I know a few people who are diagnosed. They all flunked out of college, and one is much more of a mess than I am due to adhd. I did pretty well despite having my whatever.

From co-workers and fellow students, I ""suck"" but am ""not a total dickwad"". I've also been called lazy, autistic, weird. I'm unreliable, and either solo group projects or nearly sink them by doing nothing. I can't keep a schedule or routine, but also don't like changes to schedule or routine. Have an issue with self control with addictions, so I've always limited myself to legal things. I've always had a lot of interests and hobbies I can't quite seem to put actual effort into or even finish over just dicking around with instant gratification sources, though drugs are in the minority of that. I'm clumsy, and often clueless in situations beyond being home alone, have issues with my social/speech filter, have some emotion/mood/anger impulse control issues, and often don't think things through regardless of that biting me in the ass untill I've just done it enough for autopilot to do the work for me. No matter how much I over think things I always miss the mark, or point, or needed to not spend all my time thinking over just doing. I'm one of those people that are recognizable/remembered years later, which is funny when I can barely remember anyone past a few years and would be happier forgotten since I'm rarely not the strange guy in the group.

I fit the definition of everything from a Dry Drunk (these behaviors persist even half a year after kicking drinking, I binge drank from 20-26 but it allowed me to ""schedule"" my problem which did exist before drinking and I may have failed college otherwise), to just plain underdeveloped ( lived with family until last year, we all had codependency and ACoA stemming psychological issues).

ADHD as I understand it is months of waiting for expensive testing, and the medication is hard to get. That being said, I did find I've never been more consistent and on track than when I was wearing nicotine patches, so I wouldn't rule out ADHD.

I've even considered ASD/Aspergers, but I don't have sensory issues or sensory overload. I'm ok with crowds, people. My weird is more from boredom, and I recognize expressions, etc, am a bit slow on context, most of my social faux pas are from weak impulse control as opposed to acting like I know I should, but in new situations I am fucking useless and slow to learn."
"**hug** 
I just take Clonidine for now, but I have a feeling that when I go see my Psych next week, she is going to add something for my...current issue. Stay strong!! &lt;3"
"1. go to a doctor they are nice, usually. If you don't like the doctor you go to, go to a different one!

2. You don't need to ""fight"" anxiety, but I am not a doctor (see 1)"
"Absolutely. I understand. I am still drifting through life with no idea where I'm going...and I'm 47 and the mama of 5, and a wife of 24 years. :) Thanks for replying. &lt;3"
By going to a therapist. You need to talk about these paranoid thoughts with somebody. And going to a therapist would allow you to do that while being in a safe environment.
"Can you maybe simplify your sentence as ""it breaks my heart when you say things like that"". Because from the answer he gave you before, I think like he is not very bright.  "
"I get subtle auditory hallucinations, rarely, but they happen under specific circumstances: I am very  tired, I have accumulated a large sleep debt and I am falling asleep.
"
"I have nightmares often, but not every night. I had a vivid one last night =\. I know there is a part of DBT that addresses nightmares, but I’m not very familiar with it. "
"I know it's the overthinking of bad stuff that blinds me for the good moments. 

That's just for me though we're all different that's why your comment triggered me slightly."
I mean you need to find the underlying issue that makes you feel that way and have that fixed. Maybe your therapist can find the issue and help you deal with it another way.
"I relate to this, I got basically forced into full time work and it ended up with me being on medical leave for over a month. Have you tried any medication for your anxiety?"
I sort of get what you’re feeling. I’m a gay Christian and I get awful shit from both sides- you just gotta find your middle and make friends there- even still it sucks.
"If you work in health care, youd realize a mentally ill person doesnt come to a support community to debate. Go debate with someone else.

Edit: or somewhere else, actually."
In my country they don't make specific diagnoses like that they'd just say you're a schizo dangerous to society and lock you up in the ward and shoot some Haldol in your ass
Personality disorders do not always cause abusive behavior and not all abusers have personality disorders. Please stop spreading the idea that those two things must coexist.
"Sorry I didn’t even know what MD was or how to treat it, but I’m curious what an experience is like. Could you explain one of your daydreams and how it’s so addicting?"
That's a really good goal to have! Where do you go to have these conversations? And what advice would you have for someone with social anxiety in terms of talking to people?
That's one thing I don't really have. A friend or support who I can lean on. I have been through mental health before and had such a hard time opening up with anyone there.
"Well, maybe you could just speak with someone at school. The nurse, your favorite teacher.. someone and let them read this or know how you are feeling and that you need help"
"Yes, it's an app. I don't know if it stands for anything. I downloaded it a few weeks ago but just started using it last night because I couldn't fall asleep due to anxiety."
"like this metoo movement bullshit is what im talking about

this whole thing its not your fault you were assaulted and your story matters and your life matters. no it doesnt"
"yeah :/ - I guess I'm doing everything I can...sleep, daily exercise, diet, anti-depressants, and in therapy. Still sucks though. I wish there was something else I could do."
"Do you feel sad? It could be more of a physical thing than a mental thing? Like tear duct problems? Have you gone to see a doctor? Could also be a chemical thing? certain receptors aren't working properly?

&amp;#x200B;

I am absolutely not a doctor, so I'm just throwing a couple loose possibilities out there... I'm very curious to find out what happens! Sorry I'm not much of help, but please let me know when/if you find out!"
"Do you think you can handle smoothies? Sometimes I find it’s easier for me to drink when I don’t have an appetite. If you really don’t have the motivation to make them, you could always get some Ensure Plus (has more protein) to supplement until you get your appetite back. The chocolate flavor isn’t terrible. I also find mashed sweet potatoes to be easier to eat when I feel this way too. Hope you start feeling better!"
"I think her main thing is that she doesn’t want to make all of her meals. She hates cooking and rarely did growing up except for thanksgiving and christmas. She thinks that since i’ve been through treatment, I know what foods are “healthy and unhealthy”, but in reality, i’ve been taught that all foods are good. 
I agree with you that she should just hire someone because i’m pretty sure it’d be more helpful too. "
"Of course!  My therapist specializes in work related stress and often does consulting at corporations.  So he’s been great at helping me figure out who to trust (I have several bosses and the structure is strange), how the organization works, how to be most effective at getting a raise, etc.  A psychologist can absolutely help you figure out how to reframe your thoughts and come up with the most effective thinking patterns."
"That's quite a bit longer than I expected. No, it's still in your system... about 2mg worth let's say. But you're definitely feeling this because of your anxiety and focusing on it.

Unless you're like 80 pounds I don't see why that dose would even affect you at this point. I took this drug for many years at doses as high as 80mg. You obviously get side effects at that level but it's usually very tolerated even at that dose. "
"This guy is abusive and seems like he's using depression as an excuse... 

Depression does not cause abusive behavior. Personality disorders do.

The fact that he refuses therapy means he is refusing to do what's necessary to be capable of being able to be in a healthy relationship with anyone. There is no happy outcome here for you, youre his punching bag not his equal. :(

Eta: it might help to crosspost this to r/justnoso "
"i would suggest; to write down some positive affirmations and spend time recognizing things that you've been doing great at...no matter how small they are.

there's always a hotline that you may find through some web base searches that can be of some use if things get a little tough.

there's always professionals that are willing and are going to help; even if you think you're alone with your current situation.

stay blessed."
"Being tired of my own bullshit is a constant state of being. I feel. 

However, I think that you should tell your psychiatrist that you’re having suicidal thoughts so they can help you work through them. My therapist told me it’s okay to have them as long as I haven’t planned them out, at which point she would be mandated to report it. You’re not an attention seeker for wanting help, or for being scared. It just seems like something you don’t really want to do, but maybe you think it’s the only way out? Either way, don’t be afraid to tattle on yourself when you need it. You’re important and you deserve to give yourself a second chance, even if you need a hand. "
"I've been in a psych ward, both as an inmate and as a visitor.  I've been choked with a towel and forced to take a double dose of someone else's medication because I opened my whore mouth and said ""I don't think I'm supposed to be taking Klonopin, can you double check that?""  I've seen people drugged into catatonic states and hooked up with unclean, maggot-riddled feeding tubes where no one bats an eye.  I've seen a case where a nurse killed an inmate by hitting them with a car and the whole hospital denied any wrongdoing.  I live in fear every day that I will be hauled back to the psych ward if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person again.

So no. I would not be surprised."
"It's understandable that you're scared, but to me these sound like symptoms of mental illness and will simply appear in your state. It's impossible for you to distinguish thoughts into categories, because good thoughts are tricks of mind all the same.. You can't fix thoughts by thinking either. Overthinking can only work against you.

People approach life with trial and error. The idea is to try, understand, learn. But I think what many people are missing in that picture is that the brain adapts to decisions, not results. Thinking makes us great thinkers, no matter if we achieve our hopes. Still you're in control here. 1000 clowns appearing cannot make you insane, only annoyed"
"Wow. Being someone diagnosed with BPD, that’s horrible, as well as EVERYTHING else you said. I’d report her to the dean if I was in that class. Hopefully, that would get someone above her to talk to her and explain that that’s not appropriate (her nasty broad characterizations or forcing students to confess intimate details they don’t want to). If that doesn’t help, I’d drop the class and make a formal complaint. I did that when I had a biology professor that didn’t know the material required for the prerequisites the students had to take, and wanted to spend each class period discussing why he didn’t believe in evolution, in an evolution based science course. "
"You are NOT a horrible person!! What would you think of me if I told you I am a literal firebug? I start fires constantly to get rid of the cravings for it (much like a junkie geez...that comparison really does fit)...I think about fire, dream about it, want it, need it...you would be kind and loving and respectful towards me right? Well, I am doing the same for you. I don't think you are horrible in the least bit. I think you're going through some stuff that has deep roots and hopefully you can work them out with someone soon. In the meantime, I am always (again...LITERALLY) here to chat with if you feel down. &lt;3 You're my new friend, if you don't mind me calling you that."
"I read somewhere a message that went something like this:

If you are miserable every day of your life but make good choices you will end up happy. If you are happy every day of your life but make bad choices and you will end up miserable. 
Our happiness depends on the ACTIONS we take not on the feelings we feel. 

Every since I read that I have been using it because it struck me to the core. 
I was crying every single day this year but on the moments in between when I had a little strength I applied to every job I could find (I was unemployed for almost a year). I start my full time gig next month and it can only go up from there. 

You can do it! 
Start with arm circles or calf workouts. Anything small. 
If you’re like me, tech is amazing and sometimes it motivates. The Apple Watch came out and you can join the other people trying to complete those activity circle things (sorry I’m not sure what they’re called). Join a reddit page, download an app, listen to a fitness youtuber, etc)

I was so depressed I gained 80 pounds and the last 2 months I lost 30 lbs out of sheer will power. 

Let me just leave this here:
[Listen to Shia Labeouf here](https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0) "
"So sorry you're going through this. I experienced something similar with my panic disorder and I felt so trapped, like things would never get better and I would always be sick, even if there wasn't anything physically wrong. Sometimes I still feel that way when it flares up but it'snot nearly as often as it was. It lasted about 4 years before I found the right help and started to get some relief from my symptoms. I needed the right combo of meds and a patient psychiatrist, the right therapist (I had been seeing someone who was better than not seeing anyone but wasn't really helping, and then I found a psychologist with a PsyD that was far more helpful), and the right therapy (for me it was EMDR). 

I hope you're able to find what works for you soon. Maybe some of these vids will help?

"The best thing your friend can do is to seek a mental health professional. It’s common for those suffering from depression or overcoming it to see their past as “someone else” who is no longer here  versus actually thinking they died. If this person actually believes they’ve died (physically not just metaphorically)  and have been replaced with someone else it could be a sign of something more serious, like psychosis. Unfortunately, some of the most severe forms of mental illness develop in adulthood including Bipolar Disorder (can be in teens too) and schizophrenia. This would fit with the paranoia of not wanting to see a therapist, but I don’t know enough give you any more than this. 

Source: grad student for clinical mental health 

I hope your friend can get what they need and you’re a strong person for caring so much about someone when it’s so difficult to see them struggle. Best of luck. 

Edit: your friend expresses suicidal ideation. You or the parent can call for a wellness check to the police. They will evaluate them and place them on a 72 hour hold if they perceived them as a danger to themselves. If they are thinking of suicide treatment is essential. "
"My advice to you is go try to learn Scheme (variant of lisp). Try solving some problems involving [trees](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch18/trees.html) and [sorting them with mutual recursion](https://cs.gmu.edu/~white/CS363/Scheme/SchemeSamples.html). When I tried to do that I realized I was bad at math at not cut out for coding whatsoever. This is first-year introductory stuff at the university I went to. It only gets more complicated from there. Foreign languages are much easier. I've studied both French and German pretty in-depth (not that I can speak either of those).  

If you're planning on studying computer science, I'd take a look at the stuff I sent you. Scheme is pretty useless in application, but it is good for teaching concepts because it is clumsy and difficult. It is almost entirely functions and nothing else. No procedures, no loops (outside of making a recursive function). Much harder.

I appreciate your positivity and optimism, but there is a reason computer science is 4-year degree at university. It is specialized knowledge. I think the idea that ""anyone can code"" put forth by technocrat types is frankly bullshit. [Here are the course requirements for CS from the university I went to](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/programs/require/2017-2018/bmath.html). You need to take at least 10 courses in math, and two stats classes. The required math classes for the degree are: algebra, linear algebra, calculus (1 and 2), and combinatorics (I don't know what that is). If you think you don't need to be good at math to code, you are mistaken. Those are just the mandatory math courses you still need to take some other ones too. This all just for a bachelor of computer science. 

&gt;The required courses in college for CS are mostly put in place to make you a good problem solver (ex: calculus)

I am pretty certain they are there because you need to be really good at math in order to not be shitty a computer science. "
"I'll tell you what to do. Sit in front of the mirror for an hour a day. While you gaze at yourself, think about everything it is you want in life. Think about all the opportunities you have passed up. Think about the girls that talked to you that you screwed up a chance to strike a longer term friendly relationship with due to your insecurities and self hatred. Get mad at yourself. You deserve it. You have hated for to long. You have passed up so much promise within yourself that you find yourself repulsive and lost all desire to be alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you realize all this...Take a deep breath. Jump in the shower. Put some decent clothes on, and groom yourself to the best of your ability. Get back in front of that mirror and look at yourself again. Remind yourself you are the shit. Take that inferiority complex and flush it down the toilet. Replace it with a smile and some pride. This won't happen over night and you will still have depression filled days...But never forget you are the best YOU can be. You were made a certain way and you have to live with it and do what you can with what you got. I'm not Denzel Washington. I'm not Taye Diggs. I'm not Justin Beiber or Justin Timberlake...but I am ME...Those guys are handsome, rich, could get all the finest women to be interested in them, and they have people who care about them all around the globe. Me and you? We don't have those things....YET! For every characteristic that we don't have, there is a characteristic that we do have that people would be interested in. You HAVE to dig deep and exert THOSE positive things about yourself onto others. Then and only then will they welcome you for you and except your friendship. Stop acting like a kid. You may live with your parents, but that does not mean they have to be doing everything for you. Go to school, study as hard as you can, get extra help after school if needed, and maybe even get a part time job so you can get out of the house and practice a little independence instead of your usual DEPENDENCE.

&amp;#x200B;

I sit in front of my PC to. I watch A LOT of YouTube, as I love to live vicariously through others. I don't do this because i'm lazy and have nothing better to do. I do this to learn! I want to see what positive things other people do that I can learn from, and potentially do myself. These YouTubers are very funny, they are very charismatic, and even the least attractive ones have millions of fans! Why is this? It's cause people love to be entertained...they love to converse with like minded people...even if just over the internet.  I would know this cause I created a YouTube Channel myself just to talk about my mental health issues. I hope you learn to love yourself and realize you can only be as happy as you allow yourself to be. You are probably much cooler than you think...Stop doubting yourself and start appreciating the good things you got going for yourself. Get a pen and write down everything good about you....Take your time...You'll be fine bro...and the girls will come if you allow it. Build your confidence up then you'll see the change in how women see you. If you see yourself as nothing, why would anyone else see you different? I personally see myself as a King...although I have nothing to show for it....One day i'll get my crown...and no one can tell me different.

This is truly toxic - saying things like this is invalidating and isolating for people with suicidal ideation."
A big pillow to snuggle and a song/video to fall asleep to. I use this YouTube “delta waves” clip that puts me right to sleep when the anxious thoughts are overwhelming.
"Auditory hallucinations can be caused by any number of things including lack of sleep or stress. It could probably also be related to her bipolar.

She needs to see a doctor."
"Buy a cheap timer.  Set it for 60 minutes and during those 60 minutes you do nothing but clean.  When the buzzer goes off, you are done.  This eventually will become a habit."
I also have BPD... It's a horrible diagnosis. I also have other co-morbid disorders like depression but neither of those are even considered once they see my BPD diagnosis :(
I do this too. Not as frequently but it's still super odd. The best ting you can do is play with something in your hands. It directs your attention elsewhere. Also chew gum.
"I think the need to vent is normal and understandable, you can’t deny your own feelings but you can temper them with the knowledge that they’re maybe not 100% justified. "
"Id probably just say screw the essay make up an excuse for not turning it up tomorrow. Get a good rest and take care of yourself, your health is much more impt than an essay "

"It sounds like something might be going on, but if he's happy, I don't think it's necessarily an issue. I wouldn't be too worried unless things seem to change for the worse. "
"Nothing's going to save your friend's relationship. Why would she want to save a relationship with someone who acts so badly, whatever his disorder is? This guy is dangerous."
Ok but yeah I  didn’t say this but most of the time I’m afraid To go outside because I’m afraid of 6 ft 5 man knocking me out or getting hurt because I live in a ghetto
"Same here. From reading this, it’s clear that I was in a really good facility, but it broke me all the same. My single day stay was trauma that I’m still working through."
"Sue your friend for illegally diagnosing you outside medical settings, and of course, the unethical personal boundaries occurring when a professional is also closely related."
"Thank you. I hate having to explain myself or try to get someone to believe it. Makes me feel worse or like I'm lying. 'if I was bad, they should be able to tell right away.'"

The only thing that keeps me going is that I do know life can be great and I haven't lost all hope yet. If I'm in this same spot in 2-3 years or barely better then fuck this.

"Defnitely talk with your doc. I have this thing (I have Asperger's) where sometimes, I need to touch something, just for the sensation and stimulation it gives me. It sounds weird, but I also am very sensitive to sound, even though I am sure I have hearing loss in both ears due to loud music all my life. I can ""hear"" things without hearing them. It is hard to explain.   


Good luck with the doctor! I hope he/she can help you!"
Did you ever have serious dental issues as a child where you would associate tooth pain with emotional pain? Just a thought. I have only one molar left on the bottom and only a couple on the top because of bad oral hygiene. I try to take care of my teeth better now. I had to get the molars pulled because I can't stand the whine of the drill. It literally sends me into a panic attack (and I rarely have these). Good luck to you.
"During my prodromal phase I started hearing whispery voices and believing that parked cars were going to spontaneously back into me. I became paranoid and afraid to go outside. I entirely socially isolated myself. I deleted all my social media. 

Nobody really knows what causes schizophrenia, but one popular theory is too much dopamine production in the brain. Most antipsychotics inhibit dopamine transmission for this reason. "
"How many times have you switched doctors? I would hope that eventually you would find one willing to listen to your theory that there is an underlying physical issue causing your acne, stomach problems, and depression. 

I never recommend self diagnosing, but have you researched online and found any likely causes? It might be easier to get a doctor to test for something specific.

Good luck, I'm sorry you're dealing with this!"
"I keep getting referred back and forward. My doc doesn't feel equipped to deal with it (because he's not) and the mental health team think I'm doing okay by their standards.

"It sounds like you're dissociating. I recommend talking to a therapist about it so they can tell you for sure what's causing it and teach you the best skills to overcome it! In the meantime focusing on your breathing, meditations, and exercise/yoga can help. Also something that helps me is focusing on details of my clothes, skin, or something near me. But if you notice it happening definitely start focusing on your breathing! "
"Some people are predisposed to depression. 

Keeping yourself ""busy"" I think is bad advice. Being busy doesn't mean you're doing something pleasant. And that's the key imo. The mind needs to relax, decompress. 

Socializing with good people, exercising in groups, laughing, travelling to fun places, getting away. 

I can't stress that being happy and not taking things seriously is the best way to avoid falling into depression. "
"Thanks for your input! You’re so right about self diagnosing, it’s dangerously tempting and I’m trying my hardest to stay neutral on this all and wait it out to see what comes out of therapy. I appreciate your insight on bringing my concerns up with a professional too. It’s just hard because I really struggle with making myself heard in my daily life so I guess maybe I was hoping to make my ideas known in that setting "
"The first thing that comes to mind for me is depression. When I was super depressed it often felt like I only experienced certain emotions on a reaction/surface level, and I was watching, feeling nothing, from inside.

The other thing that comes to mind is some sort of personality/issue some people have where they don't feel good/""ok"" until they're thrill-seeking but that doesn't sound quite right &amp; neither am I an expert."
"With all respect, she can fuck off with that attitude. You didn’t choose this. You have no say in it and you would change it if you could. 

Try to help her understand, but if she doesn’t come around, do everything in your ~~opinion~~ power to not find your value in what she thinks and says. Sounds terrible as she is your mother, but it will continue to eat at you if you try to appease people that just don’t understand. "
"&gt; Just a side note, I don't throw up on purpose, or want to throw up, ever.

I guess I'm a bit confused with this being on /r/mentalhealth , are you saying that you get a strong urge that you need to void your stomach and so you force yourself to vomit somehow? Or do you mean your body gets nauseous to the point that you can't prevent yourself from vomiting?

If it's the latter I would say the first course of action would be to visit the doctor and they can test to rule out something physical in nature causing it over it being psychosomatic, which is important because physical things that would cause chronic vomiting could be very serious in nature if it is a physical cause."
"1. By calling people with mental illness unrepentant sinners who categorically ""hate God,"" you *absolutely are* putting them down.

2. You understand nothing about depression, mental illness, or Christianity.  All of your comments on /r/depression have been removed and the vast majority of people who deign to reply to you on /r/Christianity think you are arrogant, ignorant, and hateful.  You understand nothing.

3. You are so arrogant that you believe it is impossible for you to cause harm to another person.

4. I know more about genuine happiness on my worst days than you ever could know after a lifetime of your best days.

5. You are a terrible person and a worse Christian.  "
"I have a chronic mental illness, and I frame my medication the way anyone else with a chronic illness would frame their own: I can't live a good life without it. I'm sure you agree that a diabetic needs their insulin, just as you would someone with a thyroid problem, or an autoimmune disease. 

However, I did struggle with a similar feeling to the one you expressed years ago. What made the difference was realizing that I was letting the social stigma bias my opinion. I have a chronic illness that saps away any pleasantness in my life. Taking the medication prevents that from happening and helps reduce the risk of the condition exacerbating to a point where it threatens my life."
"Idk what that meant for you, but when I dream about self harm it's usually at a time when there's a lot going on and my subconscious is working out ways that I could deal with it, whether I've been having urges or not. It's a bit like intrusive thoughts in real life- just because you think about something awful doesn't mean you want to do it, that you're going to do it, or that it has some deep meaning. 

One thing that helps is to imagine a new ending to the dream and focus on that. I had a dream that a roommate walked in on me while I was cutting and was a huge dick about it, but to calm myself down when I woke up I imagined him reacting in a way that was more compassionate. "
"Today I am hoping for a visit from someone who was very special to me. Until the beginning of July. I pushed this man away because of what I was going through. I was not in a good place and I was a danger to myself. I have missed him, he expressed to me that he misses me but has been busy lately. I'm hoping to see if there's still something between us. 

I spoke to him last night, I had told him I will welcome him back into my life but he has to understand there will be good days and there will be bad days. If he can't handle my bad days then I can't have him around. Nothing like what happened the week I pushed him away. I will update later. Please feel free to ask me anything."
"You're right.  I am feeling hopeless.  I feel like whatever I do is either going to work for a little bit, then I'm going to sabotage myself.  Or it's not going to work.  Or something is going to go wrong and I'll just give up.  Or...or....etc....  

After I wrote this, I went and cried to my boyfriend.  I did feel better.  I don't know why he loves me sometimes, but he definitely does.  My anger does often end up in tears tbh.  

I also have a fear of things getting better, which is hard for people to understand.  Feeling well when I was younger always meant I would get more shit piled on top of me and more abuse.  Even saying ""I don't feel well"" was often my only way to get a few minutes peace from my abusive mother.  And there are other things along that line too that I won't get into.  But being well wasn't a good thing growing up.  I need to figure out how to make peace with being well, cause right now it's very very scary."
"&gt; I don't know if you've ever tried drugs or been drinking lots of alcohol, I know that can affect some people's memory.

I rarely drink at all.  I have not been tipsy/buzzed in years.  I have not been drunk in at least 15 years.  My wife, for example, has *never* seen me drunk.

I have started using MJ in the last couple of years.  I don't get obliterated or anything.  It's an end of the day, try to relax kind of thing.  

No other illicit drug use.

&gt; Have you experienced a lot of stress in the past?

Well, yes, of course.  Hasn't everyone?  There are definitely issues with my upbringing.  Specifically, my mother verbally abused me when I was a kid.  She would yell and scream at me, much of it undeserved.  My older brother physically abused me too (i.e., he'd beat me up all of the time, just for fun).  I have also had marriage difficulties.  

The first few outbursts were largely associated with marriage problems, but the most recent one came out of nowhere.

&gt; It could also be that you've been exposed to some trauma that you've been ignoring 

This has been suggested by others.  I have no idea what this would be.  Something so secret that even I don't know about it..."
"You don't want to hurt yourself, you just wish you weren't alive. Those words echo in the brains of millions daily but society would call you  suicidal. I call that, ""Being Human"". Don't let anyone convince you or label you into feeling something that you aren't. This entire post of yours Screams ""ME ME ME""...How YOU feel, How YOU see things, How YOU want things to be. Let me tell you, WE ALL WANT THINGS OUR WAY.....But that's not how life works. And I say that with extreme sadness, as I too wish I had what I wanted...When I wanted it....

​

That being said....Come on. You are experiencing a lot right now. Just stop thinking about it all at once. Take each issue and break them down one by one. Your mom is ill? Ok...Address it. Go see her. Spend time with her. What happens if she passed today? You'd regret not spending these days with her, instead of sobbing for things you can't control.  It is 100% fine that you are feeling depressed over real life issues. You're not alone. However you will be alone if you don't make an attempt to address what's making you behave this way.

Step 1: Go see your mom. Take a lot of pictures with her every visit just to show her hey even if you do pass, you won't be forgotten and your grandkids WILL know who you are. This type of thing would give her life....even if just for an extra day...

Step 2: Work on your project. At one point, you made a career choice and it was something you wanted to study. DO NOT LET bullies deter you from something you wanted. It is normal for you to have self doubt at this time. You are probably regretting a lot more than Career choices...Do your work, put on some peaceful music and just do you...You have to act...not let time waste when feeling depressed. It's easy to lay in bed and cry waiting for a hero to save you...Honey, that hero is laying next to you...in fact, it's laying within you.

Step 3: Your partner has a life to. You have to let him live it and stop trying to control him through your emotions. You are manipulating him into doing what you want by crying and pleading that he do things you know he does not want to do. If he has a job that takes him out of the picture a while, guess what, YOU DEAL WITH IT like a strong woman. Don't be weak and cry all day hoping he'll not go. Thats selfish and rather rude. You should leave him and save him the trouble of dealing with your mess if you can't find it in you to work with him in regards to his job. Men must feel like they are taking care of their woman if the relationship will work. If he feels he is isn't doing his job because you are not responding to all the positive work he's put in, he'll either leave you, or worse, he'll stay and you'll feel the disconnect up close. Nothing feels worse than having someone so close but so far...and i'm sure that's how both of you feel right now....You know how to behave for your man....Work with him. Let him know you aren't 100%, but you are going to address your issues and genuinely find help to contain these problems....As they will never go away. Ever.

​

You feel like a p.o.s. because you know you have been behaving like one. I understand not everyone is perfect, and i'm not saying your partner is innocent either...I am talking to YOU...not him though. Which is why I tell you what YOU must do...If I were to talk to him, I'd tell him the same.

I didn't have a lot of advice to offer here but I'm glad that there are people out there who are willing to take the time to write a thoughtful response like this. Thank you.
I have had the same experience with legit Buddhist techniques. It seems like the main issue is how the western clinical mindfulness doesn't have the same effects as vipassana.

I needed to hear this today. I have a problem that could land me in jail if it got out of my control...not to mention cause property damage and leave families/people homeless or without their belongings. When I think about it that way (it is unlikely I would go to that extreme) I get a bit scared of myself. My compulsion is very very strong and hard to resist. This post made me realize I'm doing the right thing by getting help.
Some of these things like stepping out into a busy road without looking and driving on Ketamine put other people’s lives at risk as well so I think that might answer your ‘why the hell not?’ question. Even if you have little regard for others I don’t think ending up in prison will be a particularly positive experience. I am not sure what your diagnosis is but I would definitely try and get some help with this behaviour.
"You can be lucid and self aware and hypomanic. It’s more like...you can see yourself doing these things but you can’t stop it. 8 days is definitely long enough to see an effect. Typically with me I see effects from meds (all kinds, not just hypomanic) by day 4 or 5, so 8 is definitely enough. Other symptoms include decreased sleep, increased spending, increased sex drive, crazy decision making on all of those, impulsivity. "
"You have done nothing, in your entire history of commenting on Reddit, but insult people with mental illness, myself included.

That is the kind of arrogance we are talking about here.  

Last time before I block you: Fuck off.  Leave me alone.  Go away."
"this is basically how i think too. you said ""i'd much rather die with a backbone than without one"". what matters to me is, would i regret who i was if i died tomorrow? probably i'd regret my lack of accomplishments, but i have been standing up for myself for the last couple of years - even if it didn't always work out in a positive way - and i'm proud of that. at least relative to the ""old me"" who just took shit from everyone.

"Damn, I once tried to make a similar post on here but just couldn't express how I feel. I have almost the exactly same feelings and experiences than you have. I have always wondered what it is because it's so confusing? Am I narcissist? A self aware narcissist? Am I losing my mind? Have I already lost it ages ago? Why do I keep idolizing myself in my dreams and thoughts but never really act like a selfish or narcissist person towards anyone else? Did I just not get enough attention in the childhood? I'm not very empathetic person but still not a total asshole.

I don't really care what the diagnosis is I just want to be normal and it's interesting to find someone else to relate."
"That kind of self doubt happens when people try to change your personality.. It's not necessarily you, and it's not necessarily your parents or society being mean, it could be your parents misguided attempt to create a better future for you. Or, it could be that they're mean, I really can't give an opinion on that, as I don't know them. I've found that it helps to take a minute, align your thoughts and try not to second guess yourself. You're probably not insane, you're just going through a lot of difficult circumstances. It's not your fault and it doesn't mean you're a bad person, it usually means that you're unique and people may tend to want to quash that 'for your own good'."
"Lexapro destroyed me physically when I first started taking it... For the first month I had to take nausea medication (promethazine HCI tabs a few times a day) along with it just to cope. I was twitchy, restless, had zinging in my legs, jaw soreness, etc. My doctor advised me that the meds start to work on your emotional symptoms pretty quickly, but the physical symptoms can last for a couple months. I had taken Zoloft before the Lexapro for maybe 4 days and stopped because I was violently ill but I, too, wanted to give the meds a shot. I would recommend the nausea meds, they helped so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I can tell you is after 30 days I felt amazing, and still do even 6 months later after going off of the Lexapro. The meds really hit the reset button on my brain, and I am more functional than I have been in the last few years. Hang in there!

"I lost my best friend at around the same age as you, when she killed herself. It left me devastated, I was a shell. It made me want to kill myself too. Nearly did a couple of times. But I am 10 years past that now. I am so incredibly happy that I didn't kill myself. 

My life isn't perfect, I am no rags to riches story - but life has been full of so many experiences. You will get a job, move out and stand on your own feet. You will get past this because time will keep moving forward and as a human, you are perfectly suited to adapt to the changes in life. 

Killing yourself ends your pain, it amplifies everyone else's. It ends something too soon, some people say they wish they could be 25 again and just heading out into the world.. You're 18. I don't mean that like ""Silly kid, grow up"" I mean, you are fucking lucky! You have so many experiences ahead of you, that will shape who you really are. You will meet people that will change your life, you will see and do things that other people only dream of.

Why give that up because of other people? Why give them the power to take that away from you?

Take a deep breath, figure out what you want and how you need to get it.

You got this."
"Your attitude is what I’d screwing  you over. You don’t want a person for a relationship - you want pussy on demand. You objectify women as life support systems for sex organs and they see right through you. Man up and go pay for it. There are people that can handle that transaction without feeling used or scared off by your suppressed rage and frustration.

Plus because you objectify women- you probably have unrealistic standards for how they look and act.  
They aren’t in your league.

Get real - what do YOU have to offer a typical girl. Notice it’s girlfriend and you are forgetting the friend part and are obviously only concerns about the girl parts. Even plain girls get offers for sex every day. Just sex. 
What else you got? 

An upbeat respectful attitude? CONFIDENCE? 
A sense of humor? 
Entertaining banter, friends and things to do. 

Men wanna fuck and be served 

Women want to feel special and safe

You don’t have what if takes for a girlfriend. Save up some money and pay for it with a sex worker. You don’t sound stable at this point and no girl is gonna take a chance right now. 

You need to work on yourself and also start looking at women as real people.

"I work in mental health and I disagree. He is trying to find out if Jake Paul is a sociopath and if that is why he behaves the way he does. The interview with the therapist was fine, she can't diagnose Jake because she has never met him and that is the purpose of her going with Shane to interview him and she says this. Her descriptions of sociopaths are accurate, the only thing she could have done was let people know ASPD isn't the same thing as a sociopath, they're the same but different, and maybe she did and it was cut for some reason so let's not judge her either. 

I would link if I knew how on mobile but there is a tweet string going around with someone who does have ASPD of the sociopathic variety and has stated he/she isn't upset with Shane and was doing a lot of education on it, people were asking questions, it was really great to see the positive, calm, informative interactions they were having, so let's not be upset for someone who isn't. 

Shane is clearly a very good person, everyone who has met him and known him agrees (other then Onision but he's got his own issues as to why that is) and I doubt that many people are liars so let's not misunderstand his intentions.


The series is not over so let's not judge until it is. So far, I've only seen good things come from this. Kids talking about psychology and mental illness, intrested, maybe enough to get them into the field? It's been really positive from what I've seen. "
"Im sorry for the loss of your father. In my opinion both of your parents were not educated on mental health issues, your entire time struggling with it. Like it was only your ""problem"" and they simply threw it at your docs. I'm sorry. But look at it this way, when parents see something up with their kids they take them to the dr.....they ask qhat it is and lets say the kid has a not so common disease.....wouldn't it make sense for their mom and dad to go get educated on it ; Google, books pamphlets. Your parents sound like they never even believed you had a mental illness. Living with a mental illness is actually.....very common these days...i mean look at the world we live in. Mental illness health is literally a lifestyle. You have to find a regimen of daily rituals that include meds that will help in moving forward. You seem like you're of age and its time you take the reigns of your life back. Your fathers death wasnt your fault....a heart attack could have happened to anyone....including you...you know those times when the mania is so hard and your heart starts acting up??? Feels like your heart is taking a beating. Sorry if im rambling....but what im trying to say is your mother is in fact grieving and she will find her natural way to do so. You should to, but you should be extra gentle and cordious to your body and mental health. Detach from anything making you feel down and that feels like negativity to your own body. Learn to identify whats happening around you and actually use it to help your mind. You need to grieve as well...do not worry about her....she will come around when shes done. You just focus on getting a little better than yesterday.....take it a day at time, learn about your health issues learn everything there is to know about your meds. And most importantly ASK FOR HELP there is a place called MHMR here in my county that has helped us tremendously. Find a community in your county and live long and prosper ❤"

"I have severe mental health problems and meditation is the only thing that has helped. Not western clinical mindfulness but Buddhist vipassana, so perhaps there's a difference."
"If it doesn’t impede your daily function then there is nothing “wrong with you,” you can explore the depth of yourself and your personality without psychiatric diagnoses."
Just bring it up to them. You have to be honest otherwise they can't help you. Your parents would rather you be truthful about how you feel. That way you can try to get better.
Sounds like it would be helpful for your father to encourage him to set up an appt with a therapist or least with his primary care dr and the pcp can make a referral as needed.
The other thing is. I work at a hospital and the insurance I get through them only works with THEIR psych ward. Which I feel isn't run well. But if I want completely free care.
This sounds more like you have a narcissistic personality in which you only blame others for everything and close your view about whats really happening to the world around you

I don't understand why that one situation triggered it all back in my mind. I'm on a waiting list for therapy so i'm hoping to get some answers. Thank you."
It sounds like you might be struggling with emotional regulation. Everyone has feelings and emotions with biological and psychological ways to temper them so they don't become long-lasting or overwhelming. However these systems can become less functional in stress or transition. A therapist can help you understand what has been affecting your emotional regulation and give you some guidance on how to manage those feelings better.
"Hey. Not sure what age you are, but I graduated high school 4 years ago and I STILL remember that awful feeling in your gut before the first day. I would have nightmares every single year and BEG my mom to not make me go. 

Just remember that you’ve made it this far. And I can PERSONALLY tell you that once you’re out of school, a huge weight will be off your shoulders. Think about the first September that you DON’T have to wake up for class...

Also school is all bullshit standardized testing anyway. It is in NO way a reflection of your intelligence/your worth as a person. 

So basically, hang in there. If you need to talk, I’m here. I’ve definitely been in your shoes. "
"The answer to your question isn't a simple one. But in my experience, it is often because the self-hatred comes from the inside and is based on untreated mental illness or bad habits we learn ourselves or from others (especially ""society"").

We think ""if only I could do X then I would be happy"" but it doesn't work because the pain is still inside. I've done this a dozen times.

We think ""I have all these great things, I have no 'right' to be sad' but it doesn't work because the pain is still inside.

The first step to fixing this is to be kind to yourself and undedrstand that you have a problem and it's not something to blame yourself over. Until then you are in a vicious circle."
"Constant conflicts between a part of me who wants to progress in life and in my job (I love my work and it is very challenging), a part of me who feel down/isolated/bored to death/ill and constantly judging the first one and a third who tells me that I'm too hard on myself and that I should simply accept the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Most difficulties come from flashbacks, ""strange times"" and anxiety crisis which can arrive at random times. I've learnt to manage them (often by just going out to take some fresh air or spending some time alone in a calm room) but even if I can go on then with the rest of the day without a real impact, they left me really tired.

From an intimate point of view, it has been a while since I've not been in a real relationship as I'm constantly pushing people away. Connecting with people and intimacy are where those issues are truly, darkly, shining.

I find a balance by going on full-creativity moments as I find peace in composing music and writing books, but they are often painful isolated moments in which a deep melancholy creeps.

&amp;#x200B;

Isolation and difficulty to feel emotions and connect to people, this is how my day to day life is impacted."
"He needs urgent mental health care. He may need to be hospitalised, but you should discuss that with whichever professional he is seeing (and he should be seeing someone, soon). You should also discuss which signs to look out for and when calling the police or an ambulance might be necessary.

"I wouldn't and don't take offense to what you stated. It is true 100% and I don't feel like your statement invalidates mental illness at all. For me, my pyromania keeps me company and the fires I start comfort me when nobody else is around to help me...yet...it is an attatchment that is NOT healthy to have. I like my labels (I have many) because I feel like it makes what is wrong with me more real and concrete. I still struggle to remember that I am not the pyromania or depression and anxiety, or self harm, or any other of my past problems. I still can't let go of my disorder and I probably won't...it has been here most of my life, but hidden. Now that my demon is out (funny you call it that, because that is exactly how I see the disorder), ""she"" will not let go of my mind, and I hate to admit it, but I really don't have the strength to fight it off. I can learn to control my urges so I don't go full arsonist (NEVER would burn a building, though I have fantasized about doing just that) but I just...I don't know. I don't want to leave this behind.  


That is sick thinking, but that is how I feel. Still not offended or anything by your statement. I find it very poignant and true. :)"
"From my own experience and studies both therapy and medications would work, possibly much better if you combine them. Definitely seek professional help. I would suggest seeing a good psychiatrist first. They would almost certainly refer you to a therapist too (on top of probably giving you some medication). IMO even though therapy is better in the long run, medications are a must, since they show you how a world without anxiety would be, and it lets you focus on learning about your anxiety and how to cope with it.

From my limited knowledge of drugs, you probably would be given a SSRI, a group of anti-depressants that work by increasing your brains serotonin level, that make you more happy and calm. Sertraline (Zoloft) is a SSRI, and the only FDA-approved medication for social anxiety. I had a great experience with this drug. It has negligible side effects and it does not form dependence.

Propanolol is a beta blocker. It does help by making you calm physically, and it might help you. I have used it at times before my driving tests to stop my legs from shaking. I don't think daily use of it would be a great idea though. Your doctor will definitely know better.

Go see a psychiatrist, they know what to do. If you feel unsure about your medications, you could post again and people will give you the info you need. But generally, I would say even though there's a lot of negative opinions about drugs, they are miracles, and they do much more good than bad.

About the insurance thing, I don't have a clue. You probably need to ask about that in another subreddit, with a little more info (country, state, type of insurance, etc.). But even in the worst case scenario, you'll get laughed at. I know it may hurt a lot, but it's better than suffering for years. I didn't tell my family at first too, but after a while when they figured out, they were very understanding about it (and I did not expect that!), hopefully you'll have their support too. :)"

You need to tell your doc. I started having psychosis after going off of Serequel and my doctor saw me that day and added Vraylar. It went away in about 5 days. I also had hallucinations a while back with a new med and had to be taken off. Figure out if there is a med trigger or if you have more stress or anxiety than normal because that can cause it too. It can get worse if you don’t get the help you need as soon as possible.
"I just started busiprone about 4 days ago myself. Before I started taking it the doctor told me that it may make me nauseous. Fortunately I have not really experienced bad nausea. I do however get dizzy and a little drowsy and my eye sight gets a little fuzzy for a little while. I read that it takes a few weeks for the side effects to simmer down because the medication is trying to balance it self out. Im going to give it until my 4 week check up and if im still feeling like this I might have to try something else. Maybe you should try and give it some time as well especially if it is helping the anxiety. Also your doctor can prescribe medication for the nausea. 

good luck to you"
"That happens to me as well!  

I seem to interpret what most people say differently than they mean it roughly 40-60% of the time, and my understanding only seems to improve the better I know someone. 

It's extremely frustrating to always feel wrong, in groups to feel like you are the only one on the outside not ""getting it"", to always be second guessing your own thoughts and questioning everything. Basically gaslighting yourself. 

What happens is that I get completely exhausted trying to analyze everything from several different angles in real time and get burned out easily. 

Takes me forever to recover, and I'm not always up for as much socialization as my friends and family. "
"Update: 
Also, Amazon has so many different workbooks. If you’re wanting a more structured curriculum, a workbook is what you want to get. Some of the more traditional anxiety/depression workbooks tend to down in price when new workbooks come out (which is all the time), so I’m sure you can find some really good ones that are reasonably priced. Off the top of my head, I can’t think of any, but can follow-up if you’d like. 

However, if you’re looking for worksheets that you can pick and choose from that don’t necessarily follow a set structure, check out the link I gave you. Often times, stand-alone worksheets can give us a foundation to start from. I hope this helps! "
"Been in and out of psych hospitals since my teens, and I am in my late 40s now. The last time was 2015 when I was hospitalized twice within a month and a half of each other for attempting suicide. Both times I nearly died. I got intensive therapy, group therapy, art therapy, and lots of socialization while I was there, but I missed my family a lot. That sent me into panic attacks, and they finally diagnosed me as having Generalized Anxiety Disorder on top of the Major Depressive Disorder and a bunch of other disorders that I had already been diagnosed with. The hopitalization is really what you make of it. If you truly want to heal, and listen at all the groups, and really be open and honest with your psychiatrist and therapist...then it could turn out to be a good experience. That last time I was hospitalized was truly an eye opener for me. I finally started working with the professionals and learned a lot about myself. Good luck."

Get consistent therapeutic and psychiatric help. Switching providers makes things very difficult. When a professional gets to know you over time they are better able to help you.
Hahahahaha man you should have. It’s like someone left it there for you! Do you have some sort of fire starting compulsivity disorder or just wanted to lash out and do a thing?

"It's hard, but sometimes you have to take a more active role in your therapy. If something is bothering you a lot and you don't feel it is being addressed in your sessions, bring it up with your therapist. If the therapist is uncooperative, you may need to find another one.

This is not to say you should find a therapist who tells you what you want to hear. But you should have a therapist that talks about what is important to you."
"Perhaps you are just going through a period where you just need to be with yourself. I wouldn't isolate TOO long though. Sometimes I need space to be alone with my thoughts and I don't want anyone to be around me, which is hard because we still have 4 kids living at home ha ha. :) If it becomes more of a problem for you, I would encourage you to talk to your team to see if there is something more they can help you with. Good luck!"
"Thank you so much. Your response has been the most helpful. I'm currently in grad school and some of my closest friends are in grad school, but most of them have already got jobs and are starting to get lives of their own.

"It wasn't cluttered nor melodramatic. It was actually well-written and succinct. You sound like my younger self so much that I got all choked up reading this. I had NO idea where I was going in life. I wanted to have a life, a family, a job, a house someday, but it all seemed so far away. I had been suicidal in my teen years all the way to 3 years ago off and on, so happiness did seem like a pipe-dream. It was so distressing feeling like I couldn't go on in this world and at the same time wanting to be free and just drift with the wind and experience everything life could offer. Ah, I can relate. Hang in there. I hope you can find what you're searching for and find happiness. &lt;3"
"Right now I see a therapist once a week. I originally started going due to PTSD, however it seemed there was much more going on with me than I thought .I’m a full time student so there are times when I can’t commit to this every week even though I probably should .  It really helps to talk about it with someone. The only thing that kind of sucks is that it’s ONLY once a week, so the rest of the days can be a struggle on your own.  I try to be productive with my days too and I’ll force myself to make plans with people or go to the gym.  Listening to audio books on self help have also helped me a little. I’m trying to change the way that I think . I hope this was helpful . "
"That must've been terrible! I've never had an experience like that, but once I was sold galaxy as weed an, being a dumb hs junior, didn't realize until it was way too late. So that's the story of how I was fucked up out of my mind in front of my entire school at 4 in the afternoon. Probably nowhere near what happened to you, since I've managed to get over it by now, but it still left a mark.

I think the main reason you had such an awful time is that you didn't expect it to happen, though. Not advocating PCP use, but I do think a small dose of MDMA (that I consented to) would have a very different effect.

I'm curious, too, because I have no idea what I'm doing or will do, really. "
"This happened to me! I was walking (I walk 2-1/2 miles every school day while the kids are in school) and all of a sudden the world around me wasn't real and all I saw was everything on fire. I have an obsession with fire (diagnosed pyromania) so I just felt like going and burning everything because it was like a movie, it wasn't real, and nothing would come of it because everything would go back to normal after a while.   


Dissociating huh? Is THAT what it is called? I didn't really realize there was a name for that. It was scary, but not scary. I would definitely go talk to someone and tell them what you are going through. I really hope you can get the help you need. Good luck!"
"yeah, could do that, look for an adult counsellor, but I'm not sure if I need to go on medication/antidepressants, to help out, and would rather see a psychologist/ psychiatrist. Im not sure if mental health is covered under the healthcare system here. Don't have private healthcare as that's expensive to have, albeit good to have. Can't borrow money from anywhere as I don't have a job, and I don't want to be in debt to the bank. 
Yeah, I know health is the most important thing, just difficult to get into good shape, whether it's physical or mental.
Yeah, there's that option of becoming a British national, but don't have a passport yet, or money saved up, but that's another story..."
"I don't think there's anything specific. It's more like I have two main states of being and nothing else, one that's super fearful/stressed of everything and the one I'm in right now which is just, I guess calm? but at the same time it's almost like I'm too calm, to explain more thoroughly I guess it's like I'm not really feeling particularly happy, sad, or anything, but just ""not stressed/fearful"". As if I""m not really involved in anything, and just waiting for the stress and fear to come again.

As for my fearful state, I can't really describe it accurately while I'm not actually feeling it, but I did record my feelings from those states in a Notepad file

So basically, I'm either too fearful and stressed to feel or do anything else, or I'm too relaxed to feel or do anything else.

And the recent pattern has been that I wake up and feel highs and lows of the former until something calms me down and then at night I feel the latter."
"I experienced something simular, I thought I was stuck in a perpetual existential crisis. Always wondering but never knowing, and that's human nature. We strive for knowledge of things we dont know or don't understand. 
Yeah it's frightening, it always will be in some degree, but what helped me most, was learning about it. Sounds odd I know, but my advice as a random internet passerby, is to 'hug your monsters'. You are scared of what could be? Learn about what is, and what's possible. We are in the best place for easily accessible knowledge, and you'll find that our universe is wonderful. The fact that we are, is astonishing as it is. My anxieties didn't make it any easier, but understanding where they stem from will help you overcome them too. It's no easy task I know, just know that there are people and resources out tge6re to help guide you. If you want to chat about anything hit me up, and most importantly, you're doing great. "
"It sounds like your anxiety has upgraded to panic attacks. This started happening to me a few months back. All of the sudden my chest will tighten and I won't be able to catch my breath. My hands and lips start to tingle and go numb. I am dizzy, disoriented, and my heart pounds. I get a sensation of ""unreality"". My mouth goes dry but I can't seem to swallow correctly so I can't drink anything and get really dehydrated. And I am terrified. 

From what I understand, panic attacks are almost entirely physical  while anxiety is more thought/situation based. More times than not they come with no rhyme or reason and can last until you completely exhaust yourself.

The symptoms are downright horrifying. I actually had to go to the ER once because I was truly convinced I was about to die. My doc prescribed hydroxyzine to stop them when I feel it coming on and it does help. Probably a good idea to tell your doctor what you are experiencing. "
"Hey bud, sorry to hear that things are hard for you right now. To answer your title question: people do get better. I'm proof that we do. I was horribly in the dumps, couldn't see the light of the day, stuck frozen in my anxiety and depression. But I didn't want to continue suffering and I hated that I was being put through this unnecessarily, by myself and the world.

If you need some advice, I'd say stick with the therapy. The important part is finding a therapist or psychologist who suits you and is willing to help you meet your goals, or if you don't have any right now, they should help you find direction. I went through a bunch of them before I finally found one I was comfortable with. They did not instruct me how to live my life, but rather guided me through the process of how to think for myself and allowed me to figure out (slowly) what I wanted for myself.

It took 4 to 5 years to painstakingly get better, and it's still something I have to regularly maintain like any kind of physical chronic illness. But I hope this gives you hope that you _can_ and _will_ get better with time and changes to your current life that may be hurting you. If you ever need to talk, my PM is open."
"Honestly, I’m not sure that there is a whole lot you can do here. I assume you are not a mental health professional and that’s really what he needs. But good for you for wanting to help. 

It sounds like the root of the problem is that he isn’t sure what he wants to do with his life (except play video games) while his parents are forcing him down a path he isn’t interested in. That’s something he is going to need to deal with on his own. 

You can let him know you are there if he ever wants to talk (if you are really willing to fulfill that commitment if he says he does). You can also encourage him to keep seeing his counselor. And if you have concerns about his safety or think he is suicidal with intent to go through with it, you should call 911... unless there is a less emergent option (i.e. if you are with him on campus you can try to talk him into going to the counseling center or student health or whatever)

Also if his parents don’t know what’s going on that would be a conversation to have. But I don’t know how responsive they would be. 

Above all, just don’t be judgmental and try to be gentle with him. Depression is not something one can just “get over.”"
"your emotions are there for a reason, it's trying to tell you something. I dont think ""controlling"" emotions is even really possible? We can't really minimize how we feel, we feel that way for a reason. When we feel shitty, we naturally want to get rid of those emotions, and the more you fight it, the more resistance you build up against yourself. It becomes you vs your emotions. You are on the same team! they are a part of you. Embrace them, accept them, even if it feels uncomfortable. Instead of trying to ""let it go"", maybe reframe it as ""let it be"", this way the resistance will dissipate.   
it's okay to have strong intense emotions, everyone has different capacities, you feel things strongly for a reason. Go find that reason! :)   
one of my fav quotes: What you resist persists, what you embrace dissolves. Everytime I have anxiety I repeat that over and over in my head, I try not to resist the anxiety, it's just there. It'll pass eventually. I'm not going to fight it and feel bad for not being able to ""control it"". It has helped a lot, but of course it's still hard. Good luck, you are still young and will find your way in managing these strong emotions over time and experience ! "
"Chimp, his ability to work well with colleagues does not rule out BPD.  On the contrary, the vast majority of pwBPD are high functioning folks who generally get along well with casual friends, business colleagues, clients, and total strangers.  

None of those people trigger a HF pwBPD's anger because they pose no threat to his two great fears: abandonment and engulfment.  There is no close relationship to abandon and no intimacy to trigger the engulfment fear.  This is why a pwBPD typically can be considerate and pleasant all day long to complete strangers but will go home at night to abuse the very people who love him.

You nonetheless are not describing some important aspects of BPD behavior.  Specifically, you have not mentioned a strong fear of abandonment (e.g., jealousy).  Nor have you mentioned him hating to be alone (on the contrary, you say he is content with seeing his GF once a week).  Moreover, whereas a pwBPD is so unstable that he flips between loving and hating someone when triggered by a minor event, you're describing a man who sounds stable:  he consistently treats all his siblings terribly all the time in his passive aggressive manner.

It therefore may be worth your while to take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/).  If most sound very familiar and raise questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
"Hey man, I’m 30 years old, married, and live with my parents. Don’t be so hard on yourself. The way I think about it is: our parents had it easy. Back then you could afford to move out by 18. You could work at target and have an apartment or house. Because of crazy inflation, it’s MUCH MUCH harder for our generation. I’m seeing more and more of my friends still haven’t gotten married or moved out so don’t worry. 

This life is a journey and everyone’s path is different.

I used to feel the same way you do so I’ve been there before. Then I read this book called “you are a badass”. The author says that whenever you hear that voice in your head saying that “life is hard, or life is difficult,” add “because I’m being a victim” to the end of that sentence. It seems kind of callous and rough, but it helped me realize that a lot of my failures and self doubt came from my own way of thinking.  

My other advice to you would be:

1- read “you are a badass” (you can purchase at target)

2- read “the subtle art of not giving a fuck” (also at target”

3- write down a list of affirmations and positive thoughts about yourself and read them every morning before you go on social media. THIS SAVED MY LIFE. I was so self destructive so I wrote a list of affirmations, after about a month of reading them, I had little to no self doubt. I still get depressed, anxious and I’m bi polar, but I know my worth and my worth is great. 

My affirmation list goes a little something like this:

I’m a good person 
I’m ready for the universe to bring abundance
Im beautiful 
I am good enough 
I’m successful 
Etc etc

TRUST ME, this worked for me and it will work for you. Also, consider getting involved in some type of sport, I do boxing and that has helped me tremendously. Makes me feel like a man and gives me confidence. 

YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. God does not make failures. You just need to reprogram your mind

Take care

"Before you read anything else, note that I've written a detailed reply, and if you're being honest, you should address the questions I bring up.

&gt; This mindset of some one needs to fuck me to be happy. ( this is a turn off for women )

The way to test your theory (that thinking ""some one needs to fuck me to be happy"") is to randomly select people and prevent them from ever having sex. Or, is your theory that people do really need to have their sexual needs met, but they just can't be aware of their needs in order to meet them? See, I think I have an accurate view of the world: if you took away sex from the ""happy"" people, you'd find that they would become less happy.

Are you willing to test your theory in your own life?

&gt; A man that has genuine outside interests other then “I need and deserve sex” is attractive to women.

I do, but in the context of being refused sex indefinitely, possibly my whole life, those other interests become much less important. Like, when a close friend or family member has died or is close to death, work, hobbies, etc. become much less important. The difference with me is that the crisis never ends. It isn't that I don't have genuine outside interests, it's that I need to get my sexual and relationship needs met before they become priorities again.

What you see as my static ""mentality"" is really just the effects of extreme rejection and unmet needs. It isn't realistic to change m ""mentality"" without getting my needs met first, because the original cause of my ""mentality,"" as you see it, is the unmet needs. Whatever efforts to change will be reversed quickly because of the problem that started this in the first place. That said, let's not be strict about the distinction between ""want"" and ""need,"" it's really a spectrum.

It's like, I'm a car with an oil leak. ""Put more oil in it"" is analogous to what you're saying. I'm saying, ""no, we need to fix the leak first, otherwise it's a waste of time."" Then it's like you're saying ""ohh, your problem is really that you *think* there's an oil leak.""

&gt; If you can’t think of anything try volunteering with the homeless ...

Wait: you're saying I should volunteer because it will get me sex? If not, what are you saying?

&gt; No you won’t get sex out of it ...

So, it doesn't really help me with my goals. You're telling me I shouldn't want what I want, and I should just decide to want other things. I don't see much difference between what you're implying and gay conversion therapy.

Like, those other things you talk about: they might also be good, but they aren't the focus here. I've already explained what will help *me*. We are talking about how to solve the problem I've already defined. Saying ""no, no, that isn't a problem, your real problem is X"" isn't a valid solution. At least, you haven't provided enough support.

&gt; That will make you more attractive.

More attractive = instant sex? No? How much more attractive do I need to be to get sex and a relationship? Spell it out for me. See, right there you tried to ""change the goal post."" We both know that it's possible to be more attractive but not attractive enough. What is really needed is to be attractive enough. What you wrote is so (unintentionally?) sinister because there's nothing wrong with your logic and generally accepted facts. If we can just expand our psychological flexibility for a moment, it's possible for you to be right and for your suggestion to not meet my goals.

It's like if someone said ""sometimes the sky is blue in during the day. So, Jews aren't humans and should be exterminated."" It's clear that the first statement is true and the second statement doesn't follow. You're doing something similar, but more subtle.

(Reality testing) It seems that you're intentionally or unintentionally trying to manipulate me.

&gt; 2 You give the impression that you are only interested in the sex not the relationship, and bonding with another human. ( this is a turn off for women too )

Then I've given the wrong impression. I'm in the wrong for giving that impression. I do want sex. **I don't only want sex.** Is that clear?

&gt; 3 One can give them selves sexual pleasure on their own so you won’t die of frustration. 

Go back to point number 1: is it reasonable for any random person to settle for that, or will you live that in your own life?

&gt; I’m not saying it’s easy to change but if your not getting any now, what’s wrong with making some changes.

OK, you've ""convinced me."" Tell me all of the changes that will guarantee me sex and a relationship. Give me the whole list. Not just some of the ""you need to do at least X."" Tell me *all* of the things needed. And how much of them. What are these ""changes""? Because, ""change"" is too broad of a term."

Hey that's great to hear! I hope you have them in your corner to fight with you! Don't be afraid to tell them what you feel you need. Glad to hear you told them I'm proud of you!
Hi pal. My mental state has been slowly declining and I've been on the almost constant verge of a panic attack. I'm not sure what to suggest but just know you aren't alone. ❤❤
I am always willing to make sure I have enough resources. You may pm me any info that you'd think would help. I am also so blown away by support in Reddit. Thank you. ✌️❤️
"I do , I always avoid things that have to do with me seeing other people , I don't even mentally feel like visiting my friends at times . It definitely takes a toll on your life ."

Just be honest and tell them exactly how you feel. Don't leave anything important out. It's better to get this taken care of now while you're still young before it gets any worse.
Perhaps write lists and to try and do something new every week or day depending on how u feel. It’s so good that you’re trying to do something and see friends or play guitar!
School was always really bad for me especially high school. I always felt better during breaks/weekends. She’s probably not faking it. Is she seeing a therapist or psychologist?
"Sorry to hear your are feeling that way. I'm here if you want to talk. 

Have you tried seeing a professional about this? You don't have to do it alone they can help you with it. "
Thank you so much for this advice. I have actually been doing most of these things all day today. I appreciate your offer and I wish you the best of luck with your own journey. :)
"Thanks ���� I felt great on this drug. Whatever was in that other generic was poison. 
I’m praying to god going back on my old generic works again as it was a god send. "
This. I think it is a stress coping mechanism because it only happens when I have super intrusive thoughts and they normally are strongest when my guard is down. Thanks friend :)
Yeah I see how you feel. The biggest thing about mental hospitals is that they allow the patients to stay in a safe environment while they get their medications adjusted properly.
"You need to speak to a doctor, even though they are both ssris you can end up with serious withdrawal from one and shock from the other if you switch without their recommendation."
"You should talk to your doctor about switching meds maybe until you feel normal *for you* sometimes too. The goal is to be medicated and at least slightly balanced, for me anyways"
i dont know how manipulation connects with bpd? for abuse the only thing i know about bpd is many of then threatening to kill themselves if you are going to break up with them etc
"About eights years free from suicide attempts myself, friend. Congratulations and keep up the great work. 

From my further out vantage point, I will say that while there have been ups and downs, there are a lot of things that have happened in the last eight years that I’m glad I was alive for to experience. I hope you get to experience a lot of great things as well as you continue along this crazy journey called life. 

Cheers. "
"Are you saying we STINK???? (I am kidding!)

I always feel better after a shower, so I can confirm this is true! My depression seems to start getting worse at the end of summer too, when the sun starts setting before 8 pm or so. It doesn't lift until the days start getting longer again.

Also, watching funny VINE videos on YouTube or some funny content from my favorite creators helps my mood a lot. :)

Hope this helps someone else!"
"From my perspective, it sounds like she’s pretty much a moody teenager possibly with ADHD. However, it could be something like bipolar disorder. 

I recommend seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist to get testing done and possibly look into treatment. 
I know you said you can’t afford therapy, but I would at least look into the possible options and see if there’s any way you could get her to go. It could be really beneficial. "
"I absolutely understand where you’re coming from but I do hope you understand that many of us, in fact most of all have tried the “Man the fuck up approach” or at least families or friends have tried it with us. 

Like the commenter said, depression. just saps the life out of you. Believe me, you dont want to be an ambitious person who suffers from depression. It’s like your like is being jerked up and down uncontrollably. "
"I'm 22, and my libido went out the door around a year ago. I was initially having a lot of pain with sex but then my partner and I solved it. Every time we've had sex since the libido change it's been amazing, but my body/mind just doesn't want it. I'll occasionally masturbate, and I prefer it over sex now since sex is so tiring. It's actually been really hurting my relationship, so I'd love to hear some suggestions for fixes :/// "
"I'm trying to get enough sleep, but it's just not possible atm for some stupid reason. I get really anxious about not getting sleep as you are saying and it makes it super hard. I don't know how to just not worry about it. Every time I try some kind of trick to get more sleep I do it for a couple of seconds, get really sleepy and then suddenly it hits me ""I'm doing this because I'm trying to sleep"" and then I'm fully awake again..."
"If you tell him how you feel, he may understand. Maybe he could even help you. Getting a job to save up and move always helps. I would still tell him how you feel. Also, may I ask? When you say that you feel trapped, do you mean trapped in the relationship (like... The relationship is abusive or toxic) or trapped in life? Those are 2 different things. If it's toxic or dangerous, maybe try a homeless shelter or an inexpensive hotel."
"People without personality disorders can and do abuse others. Of course a PD doesn't make abuse ok; nothing does. But the fact that there are people who are abusers and have PDs doesn't mean PDs are synonymous with abuse.

And you really can't say that someone is exhibiting symptoms of a personality disorder without an actual diagnostic exam. Almost all PD symptoms are things many people do, they're just take to unhealthy extremes."
"Sometimes it's just really hard to articulate. Especially when you know, the person you're talking to about it, will not fully understand. I know that some of my intrusive thoughts are really hard to hear for my girlfriend. Even more so, when they involve her. It's not easy to explain or to hear about, I suppose. So sometimes, when they are particularly gruesome or indecent, I dont burden her with them and I will downplay a little."
"Sometimes when we see this behavior in children and teens it's because they themselves have been hurt, often by their parents or siblings. It might not be the case. But you should ask yourself, what kind of relationship do I have with my family? Do I have a strong, very close and loving bond with my mother and father?  Sometimes that's where it's stemmed from whether we're conscious of it or not. There could still be other reasons."
"I cant speak for everyone, but I have depression myself and my S.O. and friends didnt and so it was this crazy concept to them. And actually I had a few tiffs with my S.O. about it, because hes not a very emotional guy and I like hearing emotional things from him. Personally I think what wouldve helped me feel better were the little things. Little compliments. Sweet ones here and there just to let her know shes cared for (idk your relationship to the girl so I hope this at least give you an idea) but I know that I felt much better whenever my S.O. said small sweet little things, it is partly on her to as accept them and hopefully she will see herself the same. Or at least start to. "
"I have had very close encounters with this behavior, my first boyfriend was bipolar. I have witnessed one of his psychotic breaks and yes, it included violent threats towards his own family and me. It might have been wrong at the time, but I never even for a second felt fear, because I was so sure of what a good person he was outside of his episodes. Eventually violence did occur, but only in the shape of throwing objects around, breaking stuff and screaming. Even when the police came and he resisted, he still didn't throw a punch. 
Like I said, this sort of thinking may be wrong, but to this day I don't believe any of his violent threats (I still get them years after we broke up). "
"As a fellow UK Borderline I completely understand your frustration at being dropped out of the system like this (I've had it a few times). The psychs for me would just rather shove me on different pills rather than giving me DBT/Any other treatment. 

Do you know of any places that the NHS provides for personality disorders in your area at all? It might be worth trying to get a referral from them if possible. If not, I would go back to your GP and ask to be referred again but ask to see a different psychatrist. 

From my experience as soon as they hear the word ""Borderline"" they would instantly assume the typical stigma surrounding the illness and refuse to treat me sometimes because of it but after years of fighting I managed to get onto a DBT programme and finally get some sort of help. I hope this can be the same way for you. I only managed to get my therapy from writing to my MP though (This might also be another option for you)."
"You should try and build some reinforced self control, have a checklist of things that will straighten your perspective. I know it's honestly impossible to find therapy because by the time the thoughts kick in its already too late. But you should reinforce the idea. Some people have phone screens or custom covers made with wordings that remind them, some talk to informed friends friends to help them. This is a something that can be easily kept under control if you have something that will comfort you. I know the adrenaline is high, its really common with BP patients on manic episodes to display risky behavior and needs.

Consult with a psychiatrist, but also understand that no matter how many meds.. This shit boils down to self control and reinforced ideas. It's a matter of having good self esteem and balance. Don't worry, you'll be fine. You just gotta step back, make your plan and work towards it every moment till you are awesome. "
"I'd say this is social anxiety. Anxiety in general sucks, but having other people there? Sheeeesh it gets a whole lot worse ��

I also have anxiety, and it really flairs up when I'm with people. I think its the fact that there are other human beings there and we dont want to embarrass ourselves or make a lasting wrong impression, so we freeze up and try not to do anything. 

There are definitely ways to help though! Breathing is a good way to relax your body when you tense up and get really anxious or scared. It also helps if you have someone in social situations where they know you have anxiety. I work in fast food and a few of my friends there know that I have anxiety. One time I was working dining room and I couldn't change the trash cause my mind just suddenly switched off and I froze up. The person I was working with understood when I told him what was happening and we worked it out (I still get nervous around those damn trash cans). If you like to draw or write and have a lot of pent up emotions from events in the day, write or draw to alleviate some of the stress. It doesn't have to be good, just go with the flow! 

If you become overwhelmed, try going into a bathroom or an area with few to no people and try to calm down. Being around others can be super stressful, so taking breaks can also help.

I hope this helped a little. I'm sorry to hear what you've been experiencing, but hopefully this or someone else's comment helps!"

I am sorry to hear this. I have daily suicidal thoughts. It is a common experience with OCD not just depression. Have you considered you might have OCD as well as anxiety? Obviously being diagnosed with something doesn’t solve the actual problem but it can influence the best course of action to manage things. I realise your thoughts are not necessarily suicidal but any intrusive thoughts that are causing you distress suggest OCD.
"I understand. It took me 10 years to figure out what I had and that it had a name. At that time I found out it had a name, there were support groups and I started counselling.

"I was quite surprised with Katie Morton’s involvement in the doc for this reason, you’d think with the way she supports mental health and de-stigmatization she’d advise Shane to change the tone regards to mental illness or that she’d respectfully like her parts to be redacted from the documentary.

Also no mention of the fact that the environment that Jake has found himself in has led him to develop poor mental health habits (especially gaining such quick popularity and being surrounded by yes men) but that doesn’t necessarily mean he has a mental illness. He might just need to learn how to cope better in his new found status in order to improve his mental health/behaviour "
"No.  

Having a mental illness means you're more likely to get shot dead by cops and paints a massive target on your back if anyone you know happens to find out.  Or, hell, even *suspect*.  If people even suspect you have a mental illness, you will be treated worse, not taken seriously, viewed as a menace, and be dismissed outright.  Having a mental illness, or being suspected of having a mental illness, is also a surefire way to get locked up in a psych ward against your will, where you have fewer rights than convicted felons and get billed for the privilege of being abused.  

Unless they changed the definition of ""romanticize"" when I wasn't looking, mental illness is anything but."

"Ah it's all good, I don't mind drifting off topic, that's the art of conversation. I actually find that really interesting what you said about addiction because high caffeine drinks like Monster make me feel more sociable and humorous like I was in the past, so sometimes if I'm going out with friends I'll have one because I feel like I'll be a buzz-kill on the group otherwise. I also took painkillers that contained codeine before and I felt amazing, had the best sleep in about a year, but because of that I'm not going to take them anymore if I can help it. 

About the SED, I went to a doctor last year when I had this because I had to take a week off school feeling exhausted to the point of collapsing, I was getting heart palpitations and constantly felt like feinting. Got sent for 4 different blood tests (Iron, Thyroid, B12 and something else) and an ECG. Results said I was fine so where does that leave me?

I guess I'll just have to go for another visit and see what happens. I really appreciate your advice. Although you might not be a psychologist just someone to talk to about it, hear other people's experiences and straighten it out in my head helps a huge amount. I love the internet"

(regardless of their emotional well being)  I think going online to write about it is already a good step in the right direction, (articulating your thoughts/feelings into words and venting). Also choosing to deal with this issue online rather than in person/call is a rational choice. At the end of the day, I think the goal is just to get to the bottom of what happened, to find out whether the doctor was actually careless, negligent or if it was an unfortunate mistake. You are taking appropriate steps to find out what happened, and trying to manage your emotional reaction in the process, which is very good. What outcome are you hoping for? I think if someone contacted you and directly explained what happened, with a sincere apology, you'd be able to feel validated and let go of some of the negative feelings. However, people are not always accountable, so if you don't get a proper explanation or apology, maybe you can consider seeing a new doctor who lets you feel like you are cared for? I wish you all the best, and I do think you are doing quite well in handling such a tough and hurtful situation! "
"It could be a lot of things. Depression isn't always purely biological. Sure it could be brain chemistry, or a hormone imbalance like hypothyroidism. But you might have more environmental, social, or spiritual causes than your friend. Honestly, antidepressants are just meant to hold our heads above water while we work on the rest in therapy. There is no magical ""fix"" and the pills aren't meant to make you ""happy."" Whatever is causing your depression, talk to your doctor. Maybe they can adjust your medication or add in a new type of therapy. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right combination. What works for one person might not work for another. Everyone's journey is unique.

"Hey there. Just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'm here and that I acknowledge your post. I have totally been there and I get how heavy life can feel in times like you are experiencing now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it says a lot that you are at least making small efforts and haven't completely given up on trying to get out of this slump. Celebrate the fact that you still make lists, even if they don't get totally done. Celebrate that you did the dishes and that you did a couple of push-ups, these are positive things. And keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can, I would encourage you to branch out and find other coping skills outside of video games. I'm not saying give up on them entirely (I love a good video game, myself), but 80 hours in two weeks to me sounds like escapism. Try walking your dog twice a day sometimes. Or try taking them for a longer walk than normal and explore a bit. Try out something that isn't attached to a digital screen and feels more productive, like drawing or making something. Doesn't have to be every day, and doesn't have to be something you stick with forever...but just as a way to explore other options and find other avenues where you are doing more physical things. I genuinely think this will help.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom likes to tell me that life is a rollercoaster with a series of highs, lows, and those middling parts where there isn't as much going on while you are getting to the next high. It's not always going to be sunshine and rainbows, but it's also not always going to be stormy clouds and rain. I've found it helpful to think of that metaphor when I am going through times like these and feeling like I am having trouble existing. I remind myself that it is temporary and that if I just keep putting one step forward day after day, it'll eventually pass.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon a little further reflection, I wanted to add one more personal anecdote. When I was 19-21, I felt very lost and aimless and I spent a good chunk of that time underemployed, isolated from friends and family, and wasting away in my house feeling like my life was on pause and that everyone was passing me by. If I think back to the mindset that I had during that time in my life, it felt awful. I felt useless, stupid, hopeless, and like I was sitting in a giant pit that just kept getting deeper and deeper day after day with no rope or other means to get out. What DID finally get me out of that slump was perseverance. I KEPT getting out of bed. I KEPT trying to make connections with other people and trying to find a job and trying to find more productive things to do with my days. Did I succeed every day? No. But I never gave up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you won't either. I'm rooting for you. "
!! Thank you! I am very excited! It's difficult to remind myself that this is a big step. I've felt crippled for so long so it's nerve wrecking but also liberating to be doing this.
&lt;3 we’re all a family in the mental health sector. I would seek a second opinion if you aren’t happy with what they’re giving you. They should understand. Its your health.
"Albert Camus is a philosopher who writes about the question of suicide. I've been avoiding his suicide philosophy because of triggers, but his writings could probably help you out. "
"Don't know about OP but in my area the wait is 18 months for adults. 

When I was a teen I got one almost instantly (although I did try to off myself so I moved higher on the list)."
Good for you! That is a great first step. Just make sure you're honest as you can because that way he or she can help you the best. Good luck again and lots of hugs coming your way!
"How long would you say the happy periods last? Do they ever spontaneously occur without an outside cause (i.e., you're happy and in top of the world for no readily apparent reason)?"
I don't think you're a baby for acting like that. I'm sure it was probably a pretty stressful situation. Don't kick yourself too much about it. Shit happens. Even to the best of us.
"I figure you just need to love yourself as much as you can and you will pick and choose the bullshitters to the people you want to keep close to you. 

Keep seeking greener greens.
"
I mean is it like an on/off switch in that you decide to dissociate or is it an on/off switch in that you can access traumatic memories and they can be accessed by triggers whenever
"I mean it seems near impossible cause my masks and stuff like that seem to have blended with my actual self if that makes any sense, it's hard for me to discern between me and them."
"I understand. It’s good to remember that the thoughts are not your fault, and they don’t have to be reality - you are in control. Yell “NO!” at the thoughts if you need to! "
I wish you luck...you need a good therapist too. I am on a waiting list myself for one (ooooh the waiiiiiit is killing me!!!) and hopefully it will happen soon for both of us. &lt;3
"I'd recommend The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook. I believe there's one specific for Anxiety as well. Some great Apps are Pacifica, &amp; 7 Cups, and Insight Timer. "
Sadly it's one of those companies that don't recognise unions so there's nothing in house for us. Won't stop me joining one for possible future representation if I should require it
That’s exactly how I’ve come to think of it and I just needed to hear it from something besides my own inner voice. Thank you for responding. I’ve been so alone in all of this
The best advice I could give here is to see a doctor and/or talk to your psychiatrist. Could also be a negative side effect of the meds &amp; they can get you on something different
"Well, given the names she calls my wife and I in her journals, I didn't think it would be that bad to give her a taste of her own medicine. It's not like she'll ever see it, anyway."
"What type of therapy did you do? How was it exactly? When I hear about it it always seems really vague, if you could tell me a bit about your experience, I'd really appreciate it :)"
Why do you need to see a psychologist? Find a clinical social worker or licenced professional counselor. If you do not like them after a few sessions find one that fits your needs.
"Yes I have therapy once every 2 weeks and see a psychiatrist once a month.  Thanks for the advice. I do have a drive to succeed, but sometimes I just feel paralyzed to do anything. "
"You don’t owe anyone anything. But if you want to change something about yourself and can’t find motivation maybe just try to make new, supportive friends. And support yourself "
"You're in shock. It's normal. You might not cry for weeks. That's ok. Feel what you feel when you feel it and be kind to yourself. Don't worry about what you're ""supposed"" to feel. "
Your depression is taking it personally. I am NOT insulting you. Your depression makes you feel insulted so you won't listen and find happiness. I was taught how to live unhappily.
"Absolutely, I just wrote it down not but a few hours ago. I don't fit with this world and have felt this way a very very long time. I feel a mountain of things, I'm too this or that. I feel like an outsider looking in. I just don't want to do it anymore, I don't want to keep causing such issues and radiating apparent electricity out to the rest of the people around me. I'm drained and I've lost touch with what reality is apparently. "
"Aw don't feel too bad. We are all sort of in the same boat here...and believe me I can relate. I was shook (I LOVE that term so much because it explains the feeling better than any other word can) when the Therapist told me straight out that I am suffering from Pyromania. Of all things...I was like what the HELL? I am 47 not a teenager...but alas, here I am. It will be OK. I hope you can get help and I hope you find peace. Good luck!"
"I got better!  With a combo of meds and therapy over the course of a year and a half.  I’m literally living my best life.  Two years ago I thought about wanting to die nearly nonstop.  

I don’t have any advice I help you, but it is possible.  If you find the right meds or treatment plan you can literally change your thoughts and feelings to become more positive.  Still you, just more secure, better self esteem and more optimism."
"I really hate cbt and dbt. My hospital forced it on all of us and it gave me a bad taste. 

I guess I kind of added dbt into my process of slowing down my anxiety. 

I usually try to remember that my anxiety isn't going to kill me. I also name movies and games in alphabetical order to keep my mind occupied. I try to focus a little on my breathing. 

That's all I've found so far. 

Hope you find something that better fits your needs. "
"I understand what you mean, its just that reason why I find it weird because normally I would slowly ease up into feeling better. In this case where I can’t stop crying and my minds filled with thoughts I shouldn’t have, the swift change of how my head clears up and the emotion I’m feeling suddenly goes from depressed to normal, its as if I wasn’t feeling or thinking of those things 5 seconds ago it just kinda throws me off. "
"I’m talking with my mothers life long friend who is a nurse. I’ve basically told her everything and that I want to see a professional who can prescribe medication. I’m really scared though. I’ve heard tons of horror stories about psychiatrists and therapist and I’m worried that they’re going to blow me off. And I don’t know how she’s going to handle it but I’m litteraly dying as we speak, this pain is just crushing."
"oh that actually sounds more like extreme guilt than avoidance/poor conflict resolution skills. What kind of things do your parents say to you when they yell at you ? My background is Chinese, but I was born in Canada and I've noticed a huge cultural clash between myself and my parents. If I lived in a culture that normalized parents ""guilting"" their children, I would have maybe not realized how unhealthy and abusive it actually is. "
"&gt;It'd be based on when your cognitive deficits started and the onset of your depression. If they occurred around the same time there is likely a correlation. Also one of the symptoms of depression is concentration problems. Impaired concentration can then lead to other issues like memory problems and high order functions (problem solving, multi tasking, organization, etc). Processing conversations/learning new info is fairly complex and requires concentration, memory, and thinking speed.  So short answer is you always have to rule out depression when people have cognitive complaints and there is usually a link between how you're feeling and how your brain is working. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"I completely understand that. What makes me think a medicine change is needed is the fact that you're thinking of ending your life. You dont have to stay on the medicine forever, just until youre feeling better or have some answers. I think you should still talk to your psychiatrist about it though because you arent getting answers from other doctors. They may know what health issue could be causing all of this because you're also experiencing depression symptoms. Some physical illnesses have depression symptoms and psychiatrists look out for this issues because they dont want to treat you for something you dont actually have so I think it's worth a shot. I hope you get some answers. "
"It’s not so much rough per se but it’s just annoying more than anything - I felt a difference on the first day (which I actually liked!) but the rest just feel like a normal day pre-Cita - tired, vaguely sad, overanalysing everything to the point of creating fear, etc. - which I’m a little bit annoyed with. 

I take it in the evening around 8:20pm every night because the drowsiness really gets me REALLY bad (although I’m also a fairly tired person in general anyway) and I didn’t want take it in the morning as I have classes that I don’t exactly want to fall asleep in. 

I’m not sure what’s going on with this tbh but I’m glad to hear someone had a similar experience. "
"It may be the case, but it might also be not the case. The point is that we cannot fully know the depth of the relationship, the training that her SO underwent as a child, and the reasons for his actions. If someone is trained to see something over and over again, everything looks similar. 

It may very well be a “nail”, but I would only caution that we do not know the full story and we likely never will. 

Both parties have feelings and needs that are not being satisfied. In this threat I see people declaring that this man is _____________. I don’t see much empathy in terms of trying to understand the needs the SO is trying to fulfill by saying it. I’m not justifying his behavior, but I think we might like to slow down for a second and acknowledge the humanity even in someone that says something we would feel extremely sad once we heard it. 

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail warns people to realize that our perception is informed by our training, and we might miss something due to a blind spot we developed. And while this person does have experience in the situation, I’m not sure how OP would beneficially use that information to help their situation. "
"There's a visual filter applied unlike Weed, but your thoughts go deep and wide like with (a shitload of) Weed. It's much less paranoid than weed while still achieving ego death and more clear headed than the equivalent edible you'd need with weed to hit ego death. I did a regular 1.5 gram dose of common cubensis. Basically you sit and spin around inside your head, look at things from a detached 3rd-party perspective removed from you ego. Most of my own trip was just me rethinking family, friends, and other relationships, my actions, my past, my future... etc. Literally just rethinking my life without the shadow of an ego to hide different perspectives. If you're doing it right, you'll realize things that hurt your ego was avoiding and things you've been doing wrong.

Common side effects include: A strong lasting (months) desire to uproot your life or otherwise make big changes (this sounds good, but I recommend you squash the urge until you've been able to think and plan over anything, and approach things slowly), a mild alleviation of depression and self-confidence issues (several weeks at least), and pants-shittingly horrifying unease with reality (until you are dead). No seriously. Do ***NOT*** think about existential things when tripping. DPDR, mania, HPPD, and other lasting symptoms are distinct possibilities as well regardless of what you think about. Shrooms are one of the safe-*EST* drugs, but that does not mean they are *SAFE*."
"Im sorry to hear that you've been ostracised by these people. I understand what its like being lonely and feeling envy every time you see people enjoying themselves with their group of friends. 
But I dont think you need to go so far as to create your own society.

 There are tons of different people and social groups in the world and no two will be the same. Even if you are struggling to fit in with this group, that doesn't mean you couldnt fit in somewhere else. 

I can see youre in a rough place now, and going through all these years of social exclusion, I dont blame you. Being lonely is one of the worst feelings. But there is always hope, even if there is just a small amount of it. 

Have you tried, instead of trying to fit in, finding people who will accept you without you trying? I know, its easier said than done. But im sure there is a person or group out there who share your interests and quirks, who you could be accepted by without you trying. 

These people you've been trying to fit in with... it sounds like you've put a lot of effort into winning them over and I dont think they deserve that. You have value as a person and if these people are being rude or actively trying to exclude you, then I'd say you don't need to waste any more effort trying to gain their friendship. They arent worth it. You could put those efforts into seeking out groups that, again, would accept you without you having to win them over, groups that would like you for you. And you deserve that. 

TLDR: if people are being jerks after you are trying to be friendly, they dont deserve your time and you should seek out people who do. 

I hope any of this wall of text helps �� if not, feel free to ignore me "
"Thanks for clarifying your stance. 

See, I don't think that mental ""illness"" is objectively bad, though. Not only is mental illness an umbrella term that can refer to anxiety attacks, manic episodes, or whatever else in a wide range of experiences, people can and do embrace even ""bad"" aspects. For many people, it's just how they work or function, even if it isn't necessarily pleasant or efficient in interaction with their environment.

For example, my personal experience between states of hypervigilence (GAD, SAD) and inattention (ADHD-PI). Currently traveling alone for the first time in a country where I don't speak the language. Super stressful, but my anxiety helped me navigate the transit system so I manage to get to my destinations. At the cost of (edit: pathological) worrying, I haven't gotten lost yet (which is something I may lose my shit over). Additionally I couldn't plan too many activities which worked well for taking spontaneous excursions and removing unnecessary stress with sticking to a strict schedule.

Of course there are challenges, but these tendencies really are a part of me (per neural pathways) and I'd rather not beat myself even more over attributes I can't help or haven't yet developed to their full potential. In the meantime, it can be empowering to recognize how they can be adaptive in different situations. And in unfavorable ones, to foster questions such as, ""how can I improve on this?"" rather than damaging, self-deprecating ones like, ""why am I like this?""  I still rip myself apart with the latter but I'm learning to accept my ""flaws"" since it's a waste of time and energy that could be used to upgrade them instead!

Edit: taking time to develop thoughts haha"
Do you have a mental health urgent care in your area? Or an urgent care that has mental health services? They're generally open past the 9 - 5 and have really helped me in the past.
"Drink lots of water!! Head fog might be from dehydration. Eat lots of veggies!! Exercise! All these things will help you feel good, and help you focus on your mental health as well. "
"I know I'm terrible. Also I did resolve it, I'm not like that. I was just confused. And I have been honest with counsellors, they don't want to help me because they don't believe me."
"I start fires to cope with stress, or I rock back and forth. I also self-harm (just did that today) and I also am a recovering alcoholic. I am not sure if it is good for you or not. "
"I suggest you start by immediately removing all guns from his home.  As to tomorrow, consider hiring someone to keep him company for the 12 hours to get him through his PTSD episode."
I'm 43 and walked out on her a year ago. She still demands alimony and child support though and has alienated my kids from me. If we didn't have the kids I would never see her again.
"It is sort of both? Idk if you can count it really but I pick my skin if I feel like I did bad (bad grades, upset someone, etc.) But if there is no big problem it is feeling mostly. "
It would be a very constructive goal to go back to the doctor indeed once you feel strong enough. Build up the strength and confidence one day at a time and it will happen. Good luck
"I’m considering therapy but I didn’t want to go just based on my own worries, so thank you for your reply, it makes me feel a lot better knowing I’m not being overly dramatic. "
I’ve been having the same problems but focusing has became a huge challenge. My teachers have noticed it and I end up being treated like I’m special needs by them and my parents.
"Lol if anything the Big 5 is an outdated test that isn't really reliable or valid. I mean it can be helpful as a tool in therapy, but I would take the results with a grain of salt..."
"Thank you for your reply! I think I do need to speak to someone, I contacted a local therapy resource in my area and I'm getting scheduled to speak to someone there, I hope it helps!"
Thank you that's very nice to hear. I am trying to see someone but I recently switched insurance so there's lots of hoops to jump through before getting a referral for mental health.
"That is not true. Bipolar disorder can present as high energy, low energy, or both. BPD has little to do with energy, and has more to do with interpersonal relationships and emotion."
"That sounds a lot like what I experience on a fever. Thankfully, that's the only time I experience it. I can only imagine how tough it'd be for someone that with the actual syndrome."
"The definition of schizophrenia is having problems distorting reality.

Maybe you are a little paranoid. Are you often thinking people are conspiring against you? At work or school.."
"Well, I love thought provoking activities, because they give me something to think about instead of an immediate issue. I would be lying if I said it has it's downsides, but it works"
"I understand totally about your gp, it seems so hard to find a doctor who understands or takes you seriously. I used to text line for the mix a couple times in the past month or do when I was at my wits end. You should be able to self refer to your local psychological well-being services too, I did it online but being an adult I'm on a waiting list. (Process was quicker before I turned 18). Hope you find something to help, good luck. "
"If he comes by without first calling as you instruct him, you come to the door and tell him that you cannot spend time with him because he did not call first and tell him when he can call you again to see you. 

""So, sorry, mike, you didn't call me before coming over as I've asked. Its important that you respect me by doing that.  I can't talk now. But if you call me tomorrow or Monday, i will make time for you. I hope u understand. """
"It's not the same thing but this sort of happened with my brother from another mother. I said one thing that set him off (basically ""don't f\*\*\*ing tell me to exercise, that's b\*\*\*sh\*\*t and you will never understand"") and he thinks he knows better than me because his wife lives with depression. ANYWAYS I am having a really hard time not having him around anymore. So it's different but I wanted you to know that you're not alone."
"Meditation is normally about being more awake. But used at night it can be very effective at inducing sleep, or making it easier.

One other tip: if you find yourself getting worked up over the inability to sleep, try to recognize that and cut it off, because it creates a vicious circle. I used to do that. 

If you simply lie in bed and breathe slowly and try to relax, that is not as restorative as sleep, but it is still good for you."
"Respirdone screwed my mind up for 6 weeks. The time my Dr said to give the drug a chance! Off it now, back on seroquel. 
Birds fly on my patio railing all the time. Sometimes they tell me hi or how I’m feeling. It’s always different birds. Sometimes they ask if I’m ready to go, ready to hop on and not come back. I try not to converse with them but they sometimes come around a lot and sometimes they don’t show up for a weeks. 
"
"YES.  I often question: am I really a good person? Is anyone a good person or are we all just tolerating how bad we are? Can I not get people close to me because I send out so many bad vibes? What the crap is with even half of my thoughts? Can I even be honest with someone without expressing the bad shit I feel so much I don't know how to deal with?

I wish it was all simple but nooo. Life had to go and make things complicated. Yeesh."
"Yes and no. The capital-M ""Mindfulness"" exercises/discussions tend to feel very similar to the obsessive thoughts/analysis that have been an issue for me sometimes, much more than a way of connecting with the present. It just feels forced.

OTOH, sometimes doing things like going for a walk without any plan where I'm going to go (i.e., wandering) will get me into a headspace of relaxed curiosity, which I imagine is the real goal here."
"I experience similar phenomena. It’s almost as if I am never really “present” in those moments and I kind of snap back into reality after the fact. It kind of feels like some sort of autopilot and when it’s all over I feel distant from who I was in that moment. It’s almost like I have different “modes” depending on the situation (who I am with, my environment, etc.). 

I think this phenomena would be considered derealization/depersonalization. 

I theorize that this could be caused by excess adrenaline or cortisol in those moments which would decrease learning and memory which could result in what you describe.

Do you find that you have social anxiety or get overexcited?"
"It's most likely your own lack of confidence. This can be extremely damaging behaviour and girls generally wont put up with it forever. I had similar feelings as a young teenager and it will ruin relationships right quick. Recognising that these emotions come from you, not her, is a big step. After that it's managing the behaviour these emotions cause, which is your accusations (not her taking time to text back). Stop this immediately. Once you've got the behaviour managed it's time to do the real hard work and have a look at what's causing you to feel these things and deal with that over time. It's good that you're addressing this and I wish you and your SO all the best on the future."
"I’m in high school. And honestly, my anxiety gives me most of my drive. It makes me a perfectionist, which idk if that is a good thing. Outside of school, I spend most of my time alone, and I think let’s me recharge so i’m not doing too much. I have to sacrifice having many friends in order to do well in school, which that decision is maybe best for some people, it definitely isn’t the right thing to do for some. I think i’m able to do well in school is because I know to stop when i’ve reached my mental limit. If you push that limit, then you’ll suffer longer term consequences. 
I know that answer can’t be applied to everyone’s life, but it’s what’s worked for me."
"Oh yes cortisol does lots of bad things to the body. It affects nearly every organ system. There’s a good bit of research on this. And your body doesn’t just release cortisol in the moment that you are stressed. If you are a chronically stressed out person then you will have higher levels overall. 
Self care is super important. Sometimes stress can’t be avoided, but do what you can to reduce it. Exercise - even light exercise like walking, stretching, or yoga - is great for stress relief. You could also try journaling, meditating, guided visualizations, drawing or coloring, going out with friends, spending time with an animal. All of which are also good ways to cope with anxiety!"
"bipolar does not mean you are happy sometimes and sad others. bipolar isn’t even a matter of happy and sad to begin with. bipolar does not mean your mood changes fifty times a day. bipolar is not fun. you don’t “lowkey feel” bipolar moods.

as someone *with* bipolar i found this post extremely frustrating and ignorant. you admit that you don’t identify with any of the symptoms, and it feels like you’re looking for something to be wrong. the baseline criteria for *any* “-disorder” is that it fucks with your life. it’s not some minor inconvenience. 

maybe eat a little better and take some vitamins so your energy doesn’t dip so suddenly. take your happiness as a gift."
"Try meditating, give the headspace app a try. 

You sound anxious? I used to really over think things (running every interaction over in my mind and cringing at stuff if said)

Honestly I’ve learnt that there is so no point doing/worrying about this!! think back about what you can remember from what other ppl have told you? (not much, and what were you thinking about them at the time? - again probably not much), trust me ppl are far to preoccupied thinking about themselves to be judging you to the point you are in your own mind).

Try to relax a little, write down x3 things each day that you’re grateful for and try to just think positive thoughts. If you find your mind wanders to something negative, just stop it in its tracks and think about something else that’s pleasant instead.

I used to be super negative but over time I’ve trained myself to be much more positive and I’m far happier - it can be dove it just takes practice."
"Honestly I really dislike this attitude. Not attacking you personally, but when people say they medication is ""fake"" and generally take the stance that you're taking, it adds to the stigma of medication and discredits the millions of people whose lives are simply better as a result of taking medication, often in ways that could not be otherwise replicated.

Encouraging people to just put up with who they are and suffer for the rest of their lives, as though they would be letting themselves down or doing themselves a disservice, is extremely unconstructive and quite damaging to those who might get a genuine benefit from taking medication.

You're entitled to your point of view but, any time I see this kind of attitude, I feel obliged to speak against it because I think it is very harmful.

If medication doesn't work for you, or you prefer not to take it, that's fine. But it is ignorant to suggest that it couldn't be the best option for somebody to enable them to live a happier life. It's one option among many and it should be considered with an open mind.

Like I said, not wanting to attack you personally. There is value in what you're saying but I do hope you change your opinion on this."
"I think its really unwise to try and diagnose someone from their meds profile. Different psychs medicate different conditions in different ways. You could end up getting the wrong end of the stick, coming to a bunch of wrong conclusions, and not being much help to your friend at all. Also, a lot of people in the mental health community have real issues with the accuracy and usefulness of diagnoses (its complicated, but there are good readings available if you are interested).

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest that you talk to your friend about how you can help them directly, and work with them in the specific sense (who they are and what they want) rather than the general sense (I am assisting Diagnosis X). I can almost guarantee you the former will be more effective than the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

Mental illness is a very personal thing, and although there are commonalities of experience under a given diagnosis, the specific experience of the person will almost always be quite ideosynchratic, particularly in terms of what they need to achieve for self care, and for their own [recovery.](https://www.disabilityrightsca.org/system/files/file-attachments/CM5501.pdf)

"Definitely abusive. Look up narcissistic personality disorder. It sounds like she could have a condition like that. Either way, it’s good that you’re out of that relationship now."
"If I were you I would talk to a doctor. I had this exact issue 6 years ago and I got prescribed medication (I know some of you are against it). It TOTALLY HELPED, like night and day! "
Is there a counseling center on campus? You could probably talk to someone and maybe feel a bit better with some extra support? I’m sorry you’re having a difficult time right now
"Its definitely not pleasant too dwell on.
Ignorance is bliss as they say.

I love living and having to die is sort of lame. Most people are either religious or some how don’t care. "

"Not much is known about it from what I've read, but I've heard certain colours or shapes/patterns along with stress and strong emotions can trigger it. Wish you luck and stay strong. "
"Oh yeah I know, I guess my other reply didn’t send, “but seriously, although I didn’t feel loved as a child I really didn’t care to...” or something along the lines of that "
"Thanks! Same offer to you! I watch cat and dog video’s to cheer me up! That usually works for me. Tomorrow is another day, every new day is a day to feel better than the day before!"
"That's a great tip.  I kind of do that sometimes when I'm feeling tired, but have never done it before when in a mental block.  Shit is hitting the fan, but this can't hurt, for sure."
"Which is true of course, but the adverts do imply otherwise. The ones I've seen typically show a person with the symptoms of more severe depression then they can apparently cater for."
"Anyone with a substance abuse problem also has a mental health one, those issues are not exclusive. Either someone is medicating a mental health problem with drugs or have developed a mental health problem due to drugs. There are plenty of programs that are called “co-occurring” that help with both issues. Until he gets clean, he can’t work on the mental health stuff because it will just continue to mask what is really going on. "
"I actually wanted to take a few Mental Health days this week, I've worked in my department alone for the past 6 months and the branch itself has been short staffed for the past 4.

 I decided against it because I know asking for something like that would most definitely blackball me or get me fired."

"It sucks to have such a shitty parent.  If you live with her, now is the time to take steps to get out safely.  If you don't live with her, now is the time to cut back on contact with her.

"What did you work on with your therapist in the session ?  
Just know its **very natural** to feel fucked up after a session, it can be extremely emotionally draining and triggering to dig up hidden feelings and thoughts that have been buried deep. 

immediately practice self care after sessions, whatever that entails for you.   
If you have someone to chat with, talk to them right after the session to help you process things further. "
"
Just breathe. Focus on your breathing. Maybe step outside, or open a window.  What does the air smell like? What does it feel like? Is it cool or warm? Humid or dry? Does it smell like pine and clay,  or asphalt and exhaust? Look at the sky. Are there stars out tonight? Are there tree limbs or electrical wires obscuring your view? What patterns do they make and what do they remind you of?

What I've listed above are called grounding techniques, and they can help. If you really need to talk to someone, don't be afraid to call the suicide hotline. Most of the call centers also answer numbers for talk lines and other services, so if you just want to talk, they'd be happy to talk to you.  "
"I care.  I just got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  Living with BPD sucks majorly but my heart breaks just as much seeing people go through their own mental shit.

I'm not religious but the narrative of god having a plan for all of us is a calming one.  I often forget this but things have a funny way of working out for the best in the end.  You might have to take a different path to get to that ""end"" but that's the beauty of life.  It's your own unique story and you never know which way it'll take you.  

Do you talk to your cats?  For some weird reason it helps me.  They're good listeners.  They won't say jack all but you can pretend they're saying stuff back to you.  "
I did NOT want to go to therapy in high school. My mom dragged me to 6 different ones until I found one I was okay with. I hated every second of it. I mainly went because they said I could only stay on the meds if I talked to the nice lady... 6ish years later I signed myself up for therapy AND psychiatry. It took me a few months before I even talked to that therapist in high school and even then it wasnt necessarily diving into my problems as much as it wasnt venting place for me. I think therapy serves different purposes for different people at different stages but it all  helps. Maybe look at support groups? Remember even small steps forward are steps forward. Sending you well wishes
"I’ll go first:

Going to the beach in the summer before the sun comes up, when the beach is empty and you have it all to yourself, and watching the sunrise while playing in the waves.  My anxieties don’t follow me there.


Going for a walk in a snowstorm.  The snow muffles sounds, and there is less commotion outside to make those sounds.  The quiet is soothing.  I love the way the snow crunches under my sneakers.  I love throwing snowballs and trying to hit things like stop signs, and street lights. I love how for those few hours, everything you see is beautiful.  When winter ends, I wait for the next one, and it is good to have something to keep sticking around and waiting for.

"Not many people understand and it's very difficult to explain. It's like somebody with obsessive compulsive disorder trying to explain why they have to turn the the door knob exactly 90 degrees or else it bothers them. I'll never personally understand it. That seems odd to me but to them it's completely normal.  


The only people I've spoke to who understand are others with this condition. Maybe you're right, maybe I do have depression on some level, but I'm officially diagnosed with ASPD and not diagnosed with the extremely more common diagnosis of depression. There is a chance I have it, but I think my thought process is explained fairly well with nothing other than being antisocial."
"This is a pattern I was in for decades. It took me a long time to start to change how I approached things, and it's not gone yet.

There are a few approaches you could consider. One is breaking larger tasks into shorter ones and using short-term rewards of some kind. I am not sure what your coping mechanisms are, but maybe you could say you'll do an hour of things you need to get done and then spend an hour doing something you enjoy.

But the larger issue is reframing why you do things so it isn't driven by guilt. This is tough to do because we get really used to having guilt motivate us to do things. Even though we feel like we hate doing this, it becomes a habit that is hard to break."
"Same situation for me - basically I’ve learnt to forgive and allow myself to move on. The people who abused me never had that intention, probably even thought they were doing what was right. They did their best, but I no longer have to agree to that behaviour. I’ve been hurt, but I learnt from it, and I chose to move on. Holding onto the hurt only makes it hurt worse. As an adult, you now have your fate in your hands, so you can choose to blame people and live in the past, or you can choose to move on, grow, change, seek therapy if it helps you, and become a better, stronger, more empathetic person from your experience. Some people don’t realise this, but your life is 100% in your power as an adult. You can learn to deal with future hurt by self validating and not allowing yourself to feel the victim. 

The other thing I try to remember:
Hurt people hurt people. What’s happened in their past to have made them treat you like that?"
"Hi thank you for your reply. 

Is there any way I can help him get better? He has tried several different medications but none seems to be helping. 

He is definitely taking full responsibility for his actions and he knows that he should not have done what he did and like what you said, if he was mentally healthy, he would not have done it because once he realised what he has done, he realised he fucked up big time.

I believe that he is truly sorry for what he has done and is willing to do whatever it takes for us to be together. He understands that I need a lot of time because the trust between us has been broken and he needs to start from square 1.  I want us to be together again but i think what is stopping me is the fear that he will hurt me again. 

It will be a gamble to say that once he is mentally stable, he won’t do it again right? But on the flip side, it may be true because when he cheated, he was detached from his actions and had no idea what was going on. 

He has such a beautiful and kind heart that it feels unfair if I don’t give him another chance to make things right since arguably he wasn’t in the right state of mind.. and i love him so much and he is the one that i envisioned myself getting married to, starting a family etc etc. 

It would be better to give him another chance so that we can strive for a better relationship and ultimately, if it doesn’t work out, I can safely say that I’ve given my all, right? "
"So, you have some options. Because of her suicidal thoughts, you could present at an ER/hospital, and see if they will admit her. Unfortunately since it (fortunately) sounds like your wife is not attempting suicide and does not have a plan, intent and means to do so, they may choose not to, since there are often a shortage of beds and they are reserved for those in imminent danger. If they do admit her, a doctor will manage her meds but those places are just for crisis stabilization, so she will not be provided with much by way of therapy or “return to baseline.” Typical length of say is 2-7 nights. 

If they do not admit her, they may refer you to a day patient program in your area, if one is available. (These are sometimes called PHP, partial hospital program.) She would attend programming for most or part of the day, see a doctor, and return home at night. 

Another option is rather than a general psych unit, admit her to a residential or inpatient program specifically for people with anxiety/OCD. You can message me if you want more detailed thoughts on specific places, but essentially these places provide specialized care, intensive therapy, meds management, and community integration. You probably don’t have one near you, but people often travel to these places because length of stay can be 3-6 months. 

Also, talk to your wife about what you’re thinking. At this point you cannot do anything without her consent. 

Edit: Clarity"
"I think Mikeybr91's comment is pretty insightful.

I don't have a great deal to add myself, but something I did pick up on was you saying that you wanted people to care about you. To me that's not something that's as achievable as say, finding people who /you/ can care about. Maybe you should stop approaching this from the perspective of what other people can do for you and start thinking about what you can do for others. No one is going to want talk to you if you don't have anything interesting to say. So maybe try to rewire your thought process a little, maybe someone you know needs help with a thing that you're good at, and you could offer that help. That would give you a nice in to chatting with them. Or why not join some groups or clubs with similar interests to your own? Perhaps a gym buddy? What I'm trying to say is it's no good standing around waiting for people to spontaneously want to be your friend and then being sad when they don't. Making friends is hard work, especially as an adult, and often friendships take a lot of effort and scheduling to maintain. Those people you see with friends just put the effort in a lot sooner than you did, but that doesn't mean you can't reach those goals if you start trying. - And trying is most definitely not refusing to start a conversation with them and then being sad about it. I don't mean to be harsh or to belittle your anxiety, but if you're not willing to try to start a conversation then why should anyone else bother to start one with you? 

Also, you said before that you disconnect yourself from others, I wonder if you do that because of a fear of rejection? That's certainly something that could be spoken further with a professional, but you need to accept once more than you don't get a free pass because you have anxiety. You don't have to connect with others, but you can't refuse to try connections and conversations and then complain that no one wants to be your friend. You don't get both."
Depends what you consider fun. If you consider it braindead morons on their smartphones looking at bum pictures on instagram all day then yes I can have lots of fun with people my age.
"Have you never felt impatient? It's like that. The feeling that on a small scale, your life is passing you by, and you're missing opportunities by sticking with one that won't pay off."
"He's not naive. He knows exactly what he's doing.
I'm not going to forgive him. He's absolutely aware of how toxic he is and he doesn't care. I have no love for him, he's a narcissist."
"I also would like to find a decent chat that specifically addresses Impulse Control Disorders, but a Google search turns up NOTHING. Sigh. So misunderstood...so alone...so stressed.

"I don’t have any helpful advice or comment, but I wanted to tell you that you are not alone. I really struggle with this as well. I hope you’re able to find some answers and help! "
"I experience this from time to time too. I think it is mostly due to my long history with self harm. Could that be the case with you too, or is this completely new and out of the blue?"
"I've been half-assedly diagnosed with depression by my family doctor, but I've never tried actual therapy, I'm slightly skeptical about how well it would work in my case specifically. "
It could be worth mentioning to the psych. The BPD subreddit might give you a little more info as well. There are also lots of resources on how to support loved ones with BPD as well.
"It's been months, the main issue is that I don't feel a need to preserve my life. Maybe I'm just an adrenaline junkie, but it doesn't scare me to come within inches of death regularly."
"Only in the sense that I now tend to write more quickly and therefore sloppily. That's because most of what I write is what the voices are saying to me, and it can be hard to keep up. "
"That is really interesting! I didn't know that. It looks like my son so much, and I have so much empathy for kids/adults that have this behavior. I hope you can find your answers soon!"
"This might sound ridiculous, but are you on birth control? I had a weird reaction to it and basically just cried every day for three months straight. It stopped once I quit it, though."
"Unfortunately I am dealing with something even odder, weirder, and more serious than self-harming.  


Keep your head up, friend. :) You are amazing and I hope things do get better. :)"
You can try over at r/DID if you want to be in the specific place it might be more helpful. I would just read their rules before posting I'm sure they get question posts there though.
You need to go see a doctor OP. That is if you're really worried about this. I'm not saying to go to the emergency room. But it doesn't hurt to go see a doctor. Better safe than sorry.
"Damn, you know what?  I read through that article, and got to the part that talks about nasal obstruction.  I have nasal growths onset by long term exposure to allergens.  Sometimes even while I'm awake I feel like I have to remember to breathe.  I also had heavy sleep deprivation for about a year straight, and am overweight.  I've often wondered if it wasn't just quantity, but my quality of sleep that was problematic.  Thanks for that."
"I feel terribly sorry for you. I was suffering from severe Emetophobia for about a decade, and this sounds just horrible. 

What ist worse: the fear of vomiting or the nausea? Do you experience real nausea at all? 

Please, please see a doctor real soon. I would love to hear back from you. 

Stay strong!!!! As soon as you have a diagnosis, be it somatic or psychosomatic, things will get better. I promise.

(sorry, not a native speaker )"
"I was wrongly diagnosed as being bipolar for years. Recently I had my hormones tested and I found they were way out of the normal ranges. All the symptoms (which sound similar to yours) can be caused by hormonal imbalance. 

It may not be the answer but I would implore you to get a blood test to check your hormone levels before starting medication for mental health.

I truly believe that hormonal problems are massively under diagnosed. "
I've suffered from PTSD over the past few years for something that happened in 2014. It cripples me and makes it almost impossible for me to be functional. Most days I just lay in bed. The only thing you can do is continue having him go to therapy. He needs to face this head first or nothing's ever going to change. And I can tell you that from my own personal experience. He needs to talk about what happened and get it out of his system.
"It's very hard to find a job here, I live in a college town so a lot of entry level positions are taken. Until I get licensed I don't have a ton under my belt beside 4ish years of fine dining serving and retail / operating a salon. Plus jobs willing to work with my school hours has been very difficult since I will be going to school Thurs / Fri / Sat Ive had two jobs tell me they won't put me as full time since I can't work Saturdays :("
"Just wanted to follow up again and say that I've got an intake appointment with the ketamine clinic on Tuesday, with the full support of my psychiatrist, psychologist, primary care physician, and most importantly, my family. I have to be off of my anti-anxiety medication (benzos) for two weeks before the infusions can start, but that will be here soon. I'm feeling more hopeful than I have been. Thanks again for your supportive messages."
"Not all. I've a friend who used to hallucinate flowers appearing out of objects spontaneously, randomly, and buttons appearing, inviting a response to push. These were relatively benign in appearance while also being indicative, among other symptoms, of disturbance. It seems it depends on a variety of contexts, individual, cultural and otherwise as to forms, not a universality. That may be a cultural stereotype, a collective assumption?"
"Oh yeah there's a lot of people like that out there! They somehow find a 'glitz' to mental illness and anxiety in particular. They feel a bit nervous as I presume most people do when talking to large groups of people, doesn't mean they magically have social anxiety and any half-wit doctor, or pharmacist, nurse, could ask probably 3 questions and be able to determine what they have is not social anxiety. I totally agree with you on that."
"That sounds really rough. Did you have any symptoms of weakness, trouble thinking, more hallucinations for the first week you were off the drug? I'm hoping this is just my body's adjusting period and I'm back to normal. It's only been 4 days now but the symptoms haven't got any better; especially my brain function. Trouble focusing, thinking, speaking, feeling tired all day. My mind wanders a lot. I really hope this isn't my new normal."
"The vast majority of people see us with ""working arms and legs"" and think that we have no problems whatsoever, that we're being ""dramatic"" and ""manipulative"". They don't give two shits about understanding that our minds are in trouble and are quick to discriminate. That's the shit reality we live in. However, the more we speak out, eventually they'll have no choice but to listen and have at least some degree of empathy. Well, hopefully."
"Yeah. I feel like my life is fucked up. Severe depression, schizotypal disorder here + anxiety. I myself suspect c-ptsd but it's still an unknown diagnosis and won't probably be recognized for a few more years. I ruminate every day. I feel like dying at least once a week (better than before... I wanted to die pretty much every day).  I go to counseling and take meds but I feel like nothing works. I'm so worried. I just want to be okay. "
"yeah I will man, thanks a ton, I'm just gonna read the shit you've told me when I feel down about it, just wish I never went on that website, I blocked it for my own sake, I think I might started meditating for 20 minutes everyday, I've been reading stories from these people online and they have said they have never been more at peace with themselves and figured out and happy, and I hope if I try hard enough I can get to this same level"
"Geez. That's stupid because in my case, the disorder is very specific. I would not care to be told ""oh you're crazy...off to the psych ward for you."" That's abusive. I'm not a danger...I control it enough that I don't let it run TOO wild normally and especially when I'm indoors. Up in the woods, I allowed it to run a little wild. I took it off its leash for a while and it ran around and tired itself out. I feel calmer now and tired myself. It isnt easy having this...and it certainly isn't fun like those stupid kids on YouTube make it seem. They piss me off to no end bc they make it hard for people like me who really DO suffer from pyromania to be taken seriously. I feel good now tho. :) "
"I agree with the others. Without that ""label"" I would have a hard time healing from the disorder from which I suffer. It would give me license to keep on denying that I have a problem because ooop--don't have anything wrong with me! I had a psychologist actually say it directly to me:  


""Yes, you are suffering from Pyromania, dear. We need to get you to see a Therapist immediately so you can start working through this issue..."" That made me cry, to be honest, just hearing it said so bluntly. It does help me understand that yes, I have a problem and yes it can be helped.   


Some people might not need that confirmation, but I know I do, and so do a lot of other people. Just my 2 cents."
"I had undiagnosed depression all through college. When I was home on breaks, once or twice a year, my mom would ask if I was depressed (moms always know, eh?), and I would always say no. I was being truthful; I didn't think I was depressed, because I could always think of a *reason* for feeling down/sad/hopeless. (I only sought treatment once I started fantasizing about suicide. Earlier might have been better.)  
So, if your councilor (a professional?) is mentioning that you may have a mood disorder, it's probably worth checking out - at the very least, you can get an answer of some kind (whether positive or negative) and not have to worry about a possibility that may or may not be real."
"I have trouble paying attention and remembering instructions. I get distracted quite easily and my short term memory isn't what it used to be.

I remedy it by writing down anything pertinent as soon as I hear it (this saves me every time I book an appointment on the phone, for example) and by calmly asking them to repeat anything I zoned out for. It never seems to bother anyone.

Maybe just carry around a notepad and pen and try to train yourself to write everything down. That'll also help you to focus, I expect.

Not saying you don't have one condition or another but, unless it's really impacting your life and you can't resolve it through practical solutions, it might not really matter."
"One of my relatives is in law enforcement and in an area with a particularly high rate of suicide.  He has had some sensitivity  training in order to deal with a bit of the aftermath but he says something interesting.

He says that many suicides are really tragedies but in some cases, the person for whatever reason was ""just out of moves.  There was no other way."" 

I think the stigma of suicide being a ""bad thing"" will be with us for awhile but with over a million suicides every year, there maybe something more to it; something almost evolutionary.

Currently, suicide is a sensitive topic, much like homosexuality was 50 years ago.  We haven't quite come out of the closet about suicide. "
"So, I'm not a mental health professional, but I've talked to my psychiatrist about a very similar experience.

Seeing things can be really common with depression (and possibly with other illnesses, I don't know).

It sounds a little scary, but the way my psychiatrist explained it to me was that it was almost like a side effect of the depression. When you're not feeling okay, your brain can do some weird things, and it doesn't mean that you're ""crazy"".

Your psychiatrist should understand and know how to handle the situation, so just be as upfront and honest as you can. Don't worry about being judged, they're there to help you. Psychiatrists have a lot of experience with things like this."
"Sounds a lot like depression to me, but you should see a professional to work out what treatments might work for you.

Being run down because of your cold can make a big difference - as soon as I start to feel tired by depression takes over, as I don't have the energy to fight it.

Cutting out caffeine is a good thing. It won't take more than a few days to get over it. You'll feel drained during that time but, in my opinion, it's worth it. I've felt a lot better since cutting out caffeine.

Whatever you do, address this now while you're still young. Don't suffer needlessly like I did. Go and see your doctor and be honest with them, then try to be open minded about all forms of treatment."
"You need to listen to me very carefully. And I'm not trying to hurt your feelings either. But you need to get help and you need to get it now.

It's not healthy to bottle up all of your pent up frustration. You need to get yourself into a supportive environment and find a way to release your feelings in a safe way.

I don't want to see you do something stupid that you're going to regret for the rest of your life. If you don't find a way to deal with this anger and frustration now, one day you'll explode and you'll only have yourself to blame. You need to go to a doctor. And you need to do it as soon as possible.

Put your mental health first. You'll be glad that you did later on in life."
"You'll be fine.  Since you can't have kids? you don't need her or a marriage.  She did you a massive favor.  Now you can focus on rebuilding yourself.  

First, stop talking to anyone and that includes females about your feelings.  See a male therapist only. 

Second, do not contact your ex.  Let it go and count your blessings. 

Emotions are information.  You don't need to share them with everyone.  You need listen to them and act on that information. Sure, you are in pain but only because of your attachment to your ex-wife.  She apparently made the move to leave, she listened to her emotions and acted in her best interest. Now you do the same. 

Get your health and finances in order.  "
"Your should talk to your doctor. I had the same issues and trazadone may not be the med for you. There are many sleep aids out there and sometimes it takes trying a few to get it right. It can be a frustrating process. Have you tried any non medicinal strategies for dealing with trouble sleeping : bedtime patterns, meditation, exercise, etc.? I know these strategies don't work for everyone and some people really need sleep aids, these strategies eventually helped me be able to stop using medications as I moved through sobriety. I really suggest talking to your doctor though, while you may be getting sleep you certainly don't seem to be feeling refreshed, which can be equally frustrating."
"I am not sure exactly what's going on here, but I've dealt with procrastination and anxiety myself for many years.

My guess is that all of this is related to a set of interacting fears. The procrastination is based on perfectionism, which you mentioned. Perfectionism can make us put off tasks if we aren't sure we can do them properly because we are afraid they won't be good enough, so we avoid them. 

The deadlines represent an impingement on your need to do everything exactly the way you want to. And some people just don't deal with deadlines well, especially on certain tasks.

Procrastinating on life chores is common, for a simple reason: they're chores! :) They aren't fun to do and we don't like to do things that we don't enjoy.

Try not to shame yourself. There's no schedule for dealing with issues. There are people who go to their graves in their 80s with issues far worse than these and never even get to the self-awareness you have."
"I suggest you take DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) which consists of group therapy and individual therapy at least once a week each. you go through a textbook written by Marsha Linehan and learn how to take care of yourself and better yourself as a person. this saved my life, literally. I attempted suicide and was forced to take it for a year. I hated it at first because I didn't want help, but eventually I grew to love it. 

I know things are hard right now. this entire community is here for you, the BPD sub is here for you, I am here for you, you're not alone love. Keep forging ahead, you don't have much schooling left and soon you'll have a career and a life worth living. you'll continue transitioning and becoming the woman you've always been :) I believe in you. things are bad now but everything is temporary. this pain will fade if you know how to deal with it properly. if you need pictures from my DBT book hit me up in the dms! "
"The only time I’m okay with self diagnosing is if it’s what you do before treatment and official diagnosis. If it’s part of trying to figure out what’s wrong and then going to get something done about it. 

What I have a big problem with is people who self diagnose to identify with a specific disorder and to victimize themselves and identify with that victim hood. Cause that behaviour is worsening the stigma of us who are actually diagnosed and actively trying to get better have to deal with. 

It’s like people who are making fake rape claims have pushed back the movement to respect and accept rape victims stories. People don’t take the real stories seriously because of the fake stories. 

People don’t take my bipolar seriously because they’ve met people who are “bipolar” and have preconceived notions of what a bipolar person is like.. and it’s always very negative. And they question my diagnosis. And Im sick of it. "
"Hey! I think looking into therapy and CBT would benefit your mental state a lot. CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts influence your feelings which influence your actions, and the cycle repeats. Thoughts -&gt; Feelings -&gt; Actions repeat. If you can start observing this process happening within you, eventually you will be able to interject at any given point. The next time you feel blood-red angry, try your hardest to look at yourself objectively for a moment and try to analyze the thoughts going through your head at the time or right before you exploded. (Say if you died during a game, you notice your thoughts are “Fuck that guy!” or “I’m so fucking bad at this game!” - take note.) Once you can recognize those thoughts consciously, begin to challenge them. So when you notice yourself thinking “Fuck that guy!” or beat yourself up, instead go into your ‘objective place’ and tell yourself “It’s okay, everyone makes mistakes. What could I have done differently there?” even if you don’t “believe it.” Eventually you will be able to consciously, objectively observe yourself and work through your own emotions, and take control over them and your actions. "
"I am sorry for what you went through.  No one deserves to be abused in any fashion.  Not trying to discount what you have already discovered about yourself but, have you investigated the possibility that you might have CPTSD as a result of your trauma?   One of the symptoms is disassociation.  

In my tiny shred of life experience, seems a lot of the mental health support community does not quite understand trauma and the toll it can have on mental health.  Wasted many years barking up the wrong tree.  Until by chance someone mentioned PTSD and I did some research and found out about CPTSD.   I went to a trauma therapist for the first time and it has now changed my life (for the better).   Right before then I had pretty much given up hope and really did not expect to be around much longer.

As anyone else in this sub will point out,  mental health conditions need to be diagnosed by a professional.  At the same time you need to do your own research and be your own advocate.  If I had not pushed myself to keep looking,  I would still be diagnosed as Bipolar and taking drugs and going to CBT,  which did nothing for my CPTSD.  I hope you figure it out and go down the path of healing.  Peace.

"There are christian counselors out there. Then there’s regular therapists as well. My therapist, he’s a christian, but he’s not a christian counselor. Really the only difference is if you want to talk about God in your sessions all the time or not.

But to answer your question, therapy is 100% okay. I have friends that are avidly against it because “God fixes all things through prayer”, which I whole heartedly do not believe is true. I am a christian, but I don’t think prayer is a simple fix for every problem. You can pray about what you should do to help your mental health, but prayer in and of itself isn’t going to solve the problem. 

Therapy will give you the tools to help you cope with your ocd. Honestly, therapy helps you learn so much about yourself. I say you should do it.

And for trying to explain what is going on... maybe use an example like... How your body needs sleep to survive. It feels like you HAVE to do the things that you do to survive in the moment or you feel like something horrible is going to happen.

I don’t struggle with the same things you do, so I may be totally wrong. I am in recovery from an eating disorder as well, so we do have that in common."
"1. get regular, vigorous, exercise

2. eat properly

3. get enough sleep

4. meditate every day

5. when you start freaking out, accept that you are freaking out. Dont try to fight it. Fighting it will make it worse. Accept that its happening. Tell yourself 'this will pass'. 

Try the following:
 
When you're freaking out, mind is racing. You need to place it on something /in the present/. 

one way to do this is with physical sensations. Focus on: 

Feeling the sensation of your feet on the ground, butt on chair, hand on desk (depends on situation, but any gross physical sensation that relates to contact with the world in the now will do). Physical sensations of whats happening presently can be very grounding.

There are other things you can do for a focus, like counting things that are a certain color, counting backwards in increments of (pick a number), pressing your thumbs together. 

There are lots of different types of focus exercises. /different things work for different people/. It might take some experimentation to find what does it for you. 

The general principle is to focus on the thing you want to focus on. When your thoughts race away from the thing, notice that, and just bring them back. You may need to do this over and over. Dont get pissed off or frustrated when your mind does something else. Just notice and bring your mind back. Repeat each time they get distracted. Repeat. Etc. THe process of doing that will put you in the 'real and now' and cause your anxiety to naturally ease off. With practice, this can really help. 

For more information, google 'mindfulness exercises for anxiety' 

Mindfulness when you are doing things is complimented by a regular meditation routine. "
"Hey, something to think about...

When I’m really suffering significantly with my depression, My life is like yours. I barely leave the house. Except maybe for take out or to pick up beer/weed. I sleep midnight-1 or 2pm each day. I key dishes and laundry pile up for two weeks. I’m broke because I’ve mismanaged money the past few weeks. 


It sucks. I noticed that during these times I spend a lot of mental energy thinking about what I wanted to get done or feel I should get done - chores around the house, personal/professional tasks, etc. Which brings up a lot of resistance in me because it makes me feel extreme anxiety about not doing enough. It really triggers the anxiety have about using my time and life “efficiently”. Basically, I’m overthinking and making myself more exhausted by enumerating mentally the ways in which my day did not live up to my expectations. 

I’ve started to give myself a lot more grace, and just accept that this is going to impact my days. And stop focusing so much on efficiency and using my time well. Might I recommend reaaaallly paring down your number of tasks for the day. Like plan 1 or 2 for the day, and really feel proud of yourself after. It sounds really silly, but this has been helpful for me as having small successes builds into momentum. Often completing a 10 minute task that I had blown out of proportion in my mind makes me think “huh, that was quick, I’m gonna do another task now.” Several consecutive days of that and you have momentum. Discipline is about momentum. Create momentum so it’s easiest as possible to maintain your discipline. 

Also make sure to prioritize tasks around the home. Keeping your kitchen and bedroom/bed made and orderly helps a lot with mental clutter in my experience. These were things I typically neglected as less important, but now I make sure to do at least 1 home cleaning type task each day. Then the idea of “I need to clean” isn’t so overwhelming. "
"Crusader, because you've already posted twice in the BPD sub, I assume you have been suspecting you may exhibit strong symptoms of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  Is that correct?  Have you discussed BPD traits with your therapist?

The human condition is that, whenever we  experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window  because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other  peoples' intentions and motivations.

Significantly,  this is true for everyone.  This is why, whenever we are very angry,  we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool  down.  We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are  experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a  pwBPD (i.e., person with strong BPD traits) is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far  more frequently because he  lacks the emotional skills needed to  regulate his own emotions.  This  means that a pwBPD experiences very  intense feelings far more frequently than  other people.

If  you suffer from BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood  (from inherited genes and/or your environment)  that prevented you from  acquiring certain emotional skills.  Most major cities offer excellent  treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP,  and CBT) that can teach you the  emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions.

They  can teach you how to do self soothing;  how to regulate your own  emotions; how to  intellectually challenge  intense feelings instead of  accepting them as  ""facts""; and how to trust  others.

They  also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in  the  room  instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's  personality  is essentially unchanged day to day);  and how to avoid  black-white  thinking by learning to tolerate strong  mixed feelings,  uncertainties,  ambiguities, and the other gray areas of  interpersonal  relationships.

Absent those skills, you  must continue to rely on the primitive ego  defenses used by young  children:  projection, denial, temper tantrums, magical thinking, and  black-white thinking.  "
"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in a very similar fashion to you.  I started with therapy/counseling, began taking SSRI's, learned to meditate, and have been doing well with it since.

1. I was placed on SSRIs.  I didn't think they helped at first and quit taking them.  However, I fell back into a depression shortly after and began taking them again.  I felt stable again within 3 days and was tracking it with a spreadsheet at the time.  To me, the SSRI's seemed like a switch.  Take them consistently, and things stay relatively stable.  Stop taking them and slowly dip into depression.  This might all be placebo, but I wouldn't be embarrassed to find out it was.  It's working great for me and I don't notice any negative affects.  I also experimented with small doses of modafinil in combination with the SSRIs.  I learned I can combat depression with the modafinil.  It restores my energy and motivation where in previous circumstances I would not have been able to do so.  I also discovered that modafinil can trigger mania if you continue taking it after depression for the energy boost.  Just another one of those moderation things you learn.  Disclaimer: Do not experiment like this outside of professional instruction/monitoring as I did.
2. I told my friends and family.  Depending on your family's beliefs and culture, it may or may not be a good idea to tell them.  At first I didn't tell anyone, but then told my family when I was in a low, low.  They all reacted strongly and wanted to help me, but I didn't want help.  I just wanted someone to talk to and lay low.  They tried to inflict their will and lifestyle on me to ""heal me"" and ""liven me up""!  It really damaged our relationship for a while.  After I found my own way of healing (without their help), I was able to come back to them and forgive them.  That's not to say it wasn't damaging though.  Our relationship still feels the affects of this 2 years later.  I also began to tell a select few friends too and received a warm welcome.  Everyone was really chill about it.  I didn't have any negative experiences.  I will say though, 2 years after diagnosis, I'm still learning patterns and new behaviors about myself.  I wish I had told less people  until I fully understood what was happening with me.  You are in a vulnerable spot and it's too easy to share things you wish you wouldn't have later.  For now, just tell the 2 or 3 people closest to you and get their advice.  Make sure their advice is sound in understanding and seeking professional help.  If it isn't, politely ignore their advice.  When you're feeling confident and comfortable in yourself again, you have absolutely nothing to ashamed of.  Discuss it openly and with whomever you'd like!  By this point, you will learn which type of people take that information and digest it well and which type of people you'll only confuse and make uncomfortable.
3. After diagnosis?  For the better!!  However, I give most of the credit here to modafinil.  I can get just enough done in a depressive phase now that no one raises any red flags about my productivity.  Prior to diagnosis, I was put on administrative leave partly due to a major lack of motivation in a depressive state.
4. I came into some financial hardship due to a manic phase and haven't been able to afford regular appointments.  If you can though, go for it.  I'd love to have a professional monitoring what's going on with me and help direct me in the right path.  Until then, I found peace in meditation.  I read the book, The Untethered Soul, and began a daily practice.  In the depth of my learning, I was meditating for 2 hours at a time.  It was life changing.

I apologize if that was lengthy!  I'm new to Reddit too and actually just made an account to talk to others about my bipolar diagnosis.  This is a great outlet.  


If I could go back in time and give myself advice just after receiving diagnosis,  what would I tell myself?  
1) Don't force anything to happen.  Allow yourself to be sad and embrace the moments you're feeling full of life.

2) Don't be embarrassed to be an introvert.  Depressed on a Friday night?  Instead of getting drinks with friends, stay home, meditate, and work on building a healthier you.

3) Sleep is essential. No exceptions.  Read ""Why We Sleep"" by Matt Walker.  In short, get yourself on a sleep schedule.  Avoid vices before bed time.

4) Meditation will guide you in understanding how to manage your emotions. . . or 'react more appropriately to emotions' may be a better phrase.  Read ""The Untethered Soul"" by Michael Singer

5) Avoid regular alcohol use.  There isn't one single benefit to drinking alcohol.  Try to cut back to just a couple drinks a week.  Better yet, once a month.

6) Focus on being healthier in every way, not just mentally.  Focus on a select few friends instead of multiple acquaintances.   Visualize what you want your life to look like after this is over.  What steps do you need to take to get there?  Take it slow and be ready to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is all my personal experience and the advice I would give MYSELF.  I'm not telling anyone you what to do.  Every situation, person, and experience is different.  My approach may not have the same success as it would for you.  Listen to your body."

"First and foremost if she tells you that she wants to harm herself or others.  If she tells you about any plan to kill herself or starts talking about how she would do it if she decided to.

As Les Brown says, listen to motivational speeches right as you get up to set the spirit of your day. It really does help in terms of overall outlook."

Sounds like mania. Lithium (a medicine) is supposed to be one of the safer ways to mood stabilize. One of the traps in this disorder can be telling yourself everything is fine and no longer needs to be worked on when everything feels better for a period. Try to remind yourself you're active trying to work on this. I recommend journaling to keep track of your own patterns. Make a list of as many problems you're having as you can think of.
"That’s a pretty clear description of hypomania, yeah. I was mis-diagnosed for 10 years before someone saw me in the middle of a hypomanic swing and concluded I had bipolar instead of major depression; it’s actually very common. Call your GP and either make a quick appointment or talk to them over the phone and tell them what you’re experiencing. You need a psychiatrist (most GPs won’t touch bipolar disorder with a 10 foot pole.) "
"What you're saying makes sense, and your flu analogy helped. I feel like the root of all my issues stems from childhood trauma, and because of that now I have all these other problems that are basically the side effects of it. And you're right nothing's changed, I'm still the same but now I have a name for the stuff I've been experiencing and can hopefully get better treatment for it now. Also, I was wondering what your hypothesis was?  "
"I don't go to Uni, but I have had lots of experience with Psychologists. It is best to just be direct with what is bothering you right off. Take a deep breath and just get it out, no matter how uncomfy it makes you feel. Being honest will get to the root of things faster, and you will feel better because the Pyschologist will know how to help you better. :) Good luck!

  
Edit: I think I'd better listen to my own advice. I am on the fence about telling the Psychologist I am about to see (whenever they get me a darn appointment--still on a waiting list) what is bothering me. It is so odd and out there for my age that I am afraid I won't be believed. Thanks for making me realize this. &lt;3"
"I think lazy as a diagnosis although easy to come to that conclusion would be quite unfair. 5 years is a long time and the issues can become quite engrained, to the point that things that seem 'easy' can be extremely difficult to even begin for others. 

Have you asked her what she would want to do, perhaps of she didn't have any of these struggles? Maybe work with her, just you and her (so no pressure) even if it's small tiny steps. Wants to get fit? Even if it's sitting in the gym car park. Or going to check the prices. Little steps. It's hard as hell for her but you need to be very careful about dumping a lot on her or pressuring her. Most of all she needs to be doing this for herself."
"Yes. This is so true. I mean, its great that we can talk about anxiety and depression now as though we were talking about any other illness (almost). Thats incredible progress and something to be thankful for. It simply wasnt possible to do this, in many situations, as recently as 10 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

But yes, its incredibly sad that our brothers and sisters with less 'topical' illnesses, are still the subjects of garden-variety fear and loathing, due to misunderstanding and stigma.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure what the solution to this is, other than the standard refrain that we have to be as visible as possible, and our real-life stories have be shared and accessible to the 'mainstream' so they can begin to understand. The flip side of this is we have to combat stigma when we encounter it - for example the use of stereotypes and depictions (including language) that perpetuate them.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think needs to happen?"
"&gt; So i’m depressed  

Talk to a psychiatrist. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you're still covered by your parent's insurance.

&gt;  i feel good when hanging out with people  

Try going to clubs/groups. There's a ton on facebook. Highly recommend getting into tabletop gaming for this. Modern tabletop games are actually pretty fun compared to what your parents played, they have that face-to-face social spark that videogames lack, and if nothing else they're a good excuse for a dinner party or just chilling at the FLGS.

&gt; how the heck  do i ask people to hang out  without feeling like I  am forcing them to say yes or else they’d feel awkward 

Be casual, don't corner them. Would you like to hang out sometime. Sure what did you have in mind. Leave it open. Later that week ask if they're too busy to hang out this weekend. Don't take rejection as personal. A lot of people at the end of the week just want to hide and decompress. Assume they're ghosting you if it persists for six weeks, then just quit bringing it up and don't take it personally. Don't plan anything out past the upcoming weekend unless it's an actual event with multiple people (EG board game night with dinner)."
"**If you ever feel like you’re going to do something crazy, call 999 or 101.**

It does not matter if you think that you’re wasting NHS time.

For some reason we’ve been pushed to feel as if we can’t call because our mental health isn’t an emergency enough. This mixed with the auto-abusive traits of mental illness will make you not feel valid.

It is valid. What you feel is real, it is how you are experiencing life and you deserve help.

The next point I’ll make is that everybody seeking mental health treatment under the NHS understands exactly how you feel. As wonderful as the service is for physical ailments, mental health facilities are being cut and thousands of employees are leaving.

It fucking sucks, and it could be one of the hardest uphill battles in regards to your illness. 

Also, do consider going private. Sometimes it takes talking to your family and scrounging everything you can to do it and fast track your way through.

Sometimes an option to consider is moving (temporarily) to another county and accessing their services with a different GP since some are more proactive and specialised than others.

I wish you the best of luck OP, you’re doing well reaching out!"
"Since they're understaffed you are in a position to negotiate with them.

1) Put your health as your first priority. You can't help anyone if you burn out. Remember, it's OK to not save everyone all the time. Just do the best you can when you can. Every bit counts.

2) Have 4 hour shifts, every other day to start. This will give you time to decompress and process your emotions between shifts.

3) Have specific responsibilities and do not do tasks outside those designated responsibilities. Stick with 2 or 3 for now (depending on how large the tasks are). Stand your ground, both with them if they ask for more, and with yourself when you have an urge to keep helping. 

If they push back, tell them that you need to take care of yourself. You got overwhelmed with your 8 hour shift, and you will absolutely burn out if you do that again. This is what you can give, this is how you can help them.

If they're still being pushy, quit and go somewhere else. They aren't being respectful if they try to push you past your limits.

If they have ridgid shift work and it's complicated for them to add in a flexible schedule like you need, then part ways. Just say it's not going to work out and look elsewhere."

"That's a tough spot to be in;, I'm sure it sucks :(

It isn't likely BUT employers would likely prefer to know upfront instead of finding out later on. I'd recommend getting help still. "
"That’s really inappropriate, inconsiderate, and kind of dangerous for a teacher to do. Definitely report him to someone - another teacher, year advisor, deputy principal, principal... "

Maybe that may ring some bells."
This sounds intresting to do I already was intrested in completely changing my personality and becoming a new person but I really want to keep the friends I have now. Thanks for the tip!
What's wrong? Can you tell me? Please private message me if you need to talk. I am not doing anything particularly interesting at the moment (ok ok all day!) and I would like to help. :)
When coming off Cymbalta I tried to end my life several times. A look online shows a lot of others in the US have reported this effect too. I wouldn’t give Cymbalta to my worst enemy.
"When you write disjointed and hateful garbage, I'm going to see that you've written disjointed and hateful garbage.

Who do you relate to more? Mom or dad? Tell the one you think will listen better and allow them to discuss it amongst themselves before you talk to them both at the same time. Good Luck.
Why don't you explain that to your therapist. Diet plays a role in your health and mental health. Maybe she can point you to less expensive food or places with affordable organic foods.
Yes. Don't banish the thoughts as wrong. Acknowledge them for what they are. Irrational. Once you acknowledge then that allows ownership in a respect. Which is the first step to control.
You are not alone. Not everyone can understand the struggle and sometimes it is hard to get out of bed. Keep putting one foot in front of the other. I am cheering for you. You got this.
"You still need a trauma therapist. If you've never explored your own body or gotten comfortable being around another person in an intimate setting, you still have trauma to work through."

your mom sounds like a narcissist. i recommend you check out r/raisedbynarcissists. this community is so validating and supportive of each other and i think you would find comfort in it.
"I appreciate you taking the time to reply thank you I am going to make it a point to practice more meditation. The therapist recommended Celexa , but the do changed to Zoloft i assume because I take a water pill for elevated blood pressure. I don’t want meds because I feel like I can do this on my own with talk therapy and because I’m willing to give mindfulness a try. And I don’t want side effects that come with meds like, at all. "
"I don't know you, your mother, or your genetic make up, but I can tell you for sure, based just on what you said that, if anyone is responsible for your mental health issues, it's your mother, not you.

She's at best incredibly ignorant and at worst incredibly spiteful and blaming you for her bad parenting skills. Regrettably I'm leaning towards the latter

Ignore her. She is so completely and utterly wrong. What she said is unforgivable."
I've been getting better when it comes to self-hatred. I've been working out since early this year and that's helped me quite a bit. I've also been doing yardwork out back and spending time with my dog. Also music. I absolutely love music. It's helped me get through some of the darkest parts of my life. You just need to find a hobby that connects with you. Having something to take your mind off these negative feelings will help you a lot.
"More often than not, a lot of early therapy (and middle, and breakthrough and late in the process therapy) isn't meant to make you leave the office feeling good. You're there to work through all the bad and conflicted feelings you carry around each day. Bringing them up will eventually lead to a greater sense of relief but the process isn't always so pleasant. It's no different than chemo or dental surgery. The procedure is often painful."
"She used to go to a psychiatrist weekly last year and had a therapist visit our home twice a week to check on her but it all stopped around a month before school ended for summer vacation. She used to take her medicine and quit around the same time, claiming that she was doing better. I do believe she has depression, just not major depression to the point of wanting to commit suicide. I’m not sure, but I’ll keep watching her for now. "
"You mention that you have a fiance? Perhaps try starting there. Tell him/her that you are ready to start making a change, but that you need help along the way. Perhaps together you can suss out a list detailing what you need to do to get your life on track again, for example. 

Having a support network is important for dealing with mental health issues, your fiance can be the fundamental part of this network, so make sure to utilize this."
"I actually may have been getting inadequate calories, because I’ll lose 1-5 pounds one day, then gain a lot back another day. It’s just hard to know when to eat or drink because I don’t feel the need to, and it could be any amount that I need, sometimes I find out I’m hungry or thirsty after I’ve just dealt with it 10-45 minutes ago.

But when you get like that you just don’t feel like doing anything. My doctor already did a crazy amount of tests, he said the only other thing that can be doing this is depression.

I usually feel a lot better during the night, I just assumed the reason I feel terrible in the day is because of lack of food and water, which helps most of the time."
"I self medicated with weed for years and it gave me psychosis. Don’t wanna say it’s not right for mental illness because I know it has helped some people, but I would say smoking every day to deal with your problems is substance abuse. Maybe try it out for a bit but, I don’t personally think it helps mental illness it just masks the problem by getting you high. I know medication does the same, but it balances you out, it doesn’t make you wavy like weed does hehe. It’s a good idea to ask your doctor though, they will know way more than me. Maybe ask them for their opinion on it? Because it’s not legal yet they probably won’t be allowed to recommend it, but it’s worth a try. "
"I think it would be important for the two of you to discuss what it would look like if you did run into each other outside of the therapy room. As long as you’ve had a conversation, you feel comfortable with the plan in case it happens, and the relationship remains therapist-client, it shouldn’t be an issue. Dual relationships are considered unethical but it’s not a major issue if it’s addressed ahead of time. 

Shoot, I ran into one of my clients last weekend on a Friday night at a bar and I live in a big city. My rule of thumb is I won’t say hello or anything first unless my client initiated conversation. That way they are in control as the client. Hope my rambling made sense! "
"I'm glad you are reaching out, you are not the first and will not be the last person who feels this way. First, I would like to reframe your first statement. You are someone who has depression and has enough coping skills to still make it through day to day life. That makes it seem more like something a person can handle instead of something that is just happening to them. I'm glad you are looking into mental health services. I believe most schools do not go through insurance for services which are usually with licensed therapists or social workers. If you need to go that route, than you can look into medicaid insurance. I'm not sure how it works in all states but in mine, it's by county. "
"I wondered if this was the case and it has crossed my mind several times. I want to believe nothing is wrong with her, but knowing we were both abused and knowing more details about her whole life up until age 20 and HOW dark and horrific it is and the fact that she's not really been in therapy besides a few sessions that were unhelpful, I do wonder if she's unaware she's got an issue or is doing something to someone out of her control. 

I'll take these into mind when I talk to her and I think there should be a happy medium or a way to tell her that it makes me slightly uncomfortable because I'm not able to give back near as much or come from a place of concern like that I feel she feels she might have to buy my friendship, I think those are great approaches to a difficult situation. 

If she did act very erratically and decide to not even talk to me from there on or give me the silent treatment, then it would really be cause for concern. "
"I'm sorry to hear that about your neighbor.

We are not looking to have my aunt committed, I'm just confused as to *why* she is doing all this. The fact that she took down the security cameras which was showing her proof that no one was there and undoing/refusing our attempts to do anything that disproves her tells me that she is aware that there really is no woman and she is making it all up. But then she goes through great expense to buy locks and claims to do things that will risk her safely (like single handedly chopping down a tree at 80+) tells me that maybe she really is convinced that there is a woman. Idk what to think. I'm wondering if this is a way of her ""reliving her glory"" of when she actually had friends and convincing herself that she is still ""relevant"" enough to people that someone wants her badly enough they stalk her?? Or is she just lying to us for some reason?? I just wish I could understand the ""method to her madness"""
"There's actually two totally separate things that get referred to as mindfulness. It's ironic that the same word is used for these surprisingly opposing purposes.

Eastern mindfulness is a traditional practicing of nonjudgmental awareness. When you do this, you let your thoughts wander undirected and without judgment. It helps you gain insight into your thoughts and feelings. Normally we are constantly judging, avoiding, or trying to pay attention to something in particular. 

Western mindfulness is the practice of sensory grounding. With this, you pay attention to one or two senses in particular and really focus on the external experience (or internal if you focus on what your body physically feels like or your breathing, but not your thoughts themselves). You might watch a candle flame or pay attention to the sounds as you take a walk. This is used for grounding and turning off the other racing thoughts that usually run through our heads."
"Your expectations for friendships may be too high.
You don't want people around just for the sake of having company. You want and need people you can give yourself to and who can accept the fact you can't always be there. The important thing is that you need to be that person to them.
Everybody you meet in life is struggling as you are. Some people are fairly more adjusted than others but we all have a need: love. They need it and you need it. I'm not talk8ng romantic love. I'm talking about the love of neighbour. I'm also placing importance on filial love.
The funny thing about these types of love is that you can benefit most when you are on the giving end. Nothing can replace that feeling. It validates us as human beings and is the basis for happiness. Focus on that and you will gradually see more and more people gravitate toward you.
One last thing: if you have one good friend in your life that you can trust and is loyal to you, you won."
"Hey, I have Aspergers too!
For me, it started out as a very rocky ride that got better as time went on. I went to a lot of counselling for my anxiety that helped but probably not as much as it was meant to but the support alone made me feel just that little bit stronger and braver. 
I found that once you got over that first hurdle of just trying to do something that makes you anxious, the rest of it is easy in comparison and that's pretty much the way I go about things now.
In regards to depression, do you know what your triggers are, if any? Mine comes in bouts but I know my triggers (spending too much time alone etc) so I avoid a lot of it by working around these but I recognise that this isn't always possible.
I suggest that you try to see if you can get yourself out there (easier said than done, I know) with your peers and see if you can make friends this way, or perhaps take up a new hobby and meet people at club meetings! Please talk to someone you trust about the suicidal thoughts though, you need to be heard and they need to be addressed as soon as possible because your life is valuable and it has the potential to be much better than it is right now. You are more than your Aspergers!"
"To be completely transparent, I have been in some devastatingly low periods in my life. I have reached out to the people closest to me so many times in my life. And even the most amazing people that I know love me never got me help. Never. None of them. I should have been hospitalized and would have really benefited from that. Instead, I had to hit rock bottom time after time and drag myself out (as a single mom of 3 kids- 1 special needs). I finally decided to get help for myself and I have grown so much. I have learned to take my meds regularly and not to stop taking them. I go to therapy biweekly and I have an amazing therapist. With all of this said... I see my friends and family posting suicide hotlines and copy paste posts talking about how they are always available with a cup of tea if anyone needs to talk etc etc. And it honestly infuriates me. Those same people I reached out to with no result. They don't want people to commit suicide but they don't want to get them help either. Saying, ""There, there. It's okay"" isn't enough! They want to be the inspiring savior that brings someone back from the brink of death instead of getting the person medical help. It's incredibly self serving. "
"Just watched a series on BPD and read a book “The Myth of Sanity”. Sounds about right. Possibly narcissistic abuse in there. What are his parents like? 

I would reconsider the relationship as you are going to lose yourself and your identity in his minds battlefield. He is isolating you from your friends by making you delete people, threatening to harm himself is a cowards response to conflict. 

I say this as caring as possible. My first boyfriend was like this and he tried to kill me two years into the relationship and then took his own life.

I never saw or realized the signs until after. I’ve now spent 15+ years learning and understanding human behavior and disorders. 

I watched a close friend of mine fly home from a study abroad to her boyfriend threatening to kill himself because he thought she was cheating on him, when we were volunteering in a hospital for sick kids. 

This is a mental disease and will not get better or change. Can you live with this? 

Just because you love someone doesn’t mean you have to be abused by him. Even if he hasn’t hit you- he is harming you. 

I hope you do your research, go and talk to a therapist yourself without him knowing and tell them what’s going on. See what they say. Get help as I can only imagine how you must feel being stuck in love and caring for him but also scared on a level that your intuition is picking up these signs. 

Remember you are not his keeper. Take care of YOU first. "

"Can I become your friend? Where you want to talk, discord, whatsapp, facebook, anything, I will be there, I would like to have your friendship and learn more about myself and you, please."
Do you see treatment for this? Or are you managing it on your own? I totally get the feeling of feeling that compulsion to do something in order to relieve anxious feelings and what not.
"Have you seen a psychiatrist/psychologist? I go through this. Or, I can't explain why I'm sad/mad because I don't really understand why I'm sad/mad. It's very irritating and infuriating! "
Hi. I am a mental health support worker and would be happy to chat with you about some options to help manage the challenges you're facing. If you're interested please feel free to PM me.
"Hmm, are you depressed?

I'm having trouble piecing together what all you're trying to say. Could you go into a bit more detail or try to provide a couple more examples of what you mean? "
"How should I be wrong, you cant write a coherent sentence, and if you dont believe me. Look at your comment history, trevor. Your child must be really stupid or does it live with his mom?"
I did. I had the flash of light. I've even had sound once or twice (look up exploding head syndrome). Don't worry yourself too much just yet. Just see your doctor and treat your anxiety.
I had to constantly lie about how I feel. But now I opened up on Facebook and actually some friends were very supportive. Though I still have to lie at work that I am seeing a therapist.
"I have spoken a lot about this problems, that's why I'm going to start with school in a special class and take medication. I made this post to vent a bit anf now I'm feeling a bit better."
I hear you. My heart rate used to spike when I was around a crowd. Then others would tell me they felt the same way. Somehow not being alone on how I feel helped me feel better with time.
I wasn't aware you could read their minds to gain such knowledge. Just because they are nonverbal or they appear absentminded does not mean they aren't capable of thought or intelligence.
"Ironically I am on meds, lots of them. Just after 6 years on them, they have nearly been worn out. I have to smoke Mary j just to calm the delusions, long story short I am schizoaffective"
"It sounds like you just cannot process sadness quickly, probably because you don't want to cry/ break down in front of people. 

Grieving is a process, and for some it takes a long time. "
"No manic symptoms, mainly depressive phases. It could possibly be something similar to bi-polar. That’s actually a good thing to say, I haven’t done too much research regarding that. "
Oh that's really interesting how it wasn't right foe you. But it's also really good you tried it to see if it would work. At first I hated my therapist so totally get the patronising part
That's how it is. No matter hard it is keep fighting need to show them the strong side of you. I know that the point will come where you want just to rest. But know that you're not alone.
"The best thing then is to be honest - that you're concerned about her well being, and it is impacting you, and at some point you need to put yourself first. See how she responds to that. "
Yea I thought it was going away. I felt good yesterday morning then the afternoon and night completely destroyed me. I think I'm still moving in the right direction. Thanks for your help.
"Yeah, I get what you mean trying to give the space for realisation is hard. I suppose you've just got to wait and hope really it's all you can do for the time if things change then adapt."
You will find that most people are quiet if they have drinking issues or they are genuine alcoholics.  the ones I have met usually keep to their home instead of a bar if they are older.
You're seriously overthinking this and driving yourself nutty. Even with drugs you'll get the odd day or few days off bad sleep. Medication doesn't cancel out your normal mood functions.
"2 suicide attempts (both nearly successful and one that had landed me in the ICU), then this recent diagnosis. It can be very destructive if I don't get help, so I had to accept it. I just wrote that I go from semi-accepting the diagnosis and outright denial that I even have this disorder. I don't want to lose my house (I could easily destroy it if ""my demon"" gets out of my control), my family, my life. This is serious and I need help now."
"Came here to say this! It's called habit stacking.  Make it part of your already established routine. Always make coffee in the morning? Take your meds while it's brewing.  Really good about brushing your teeth at night? Take meds right before that. It can literally be anything you already do--good or bad.  After smoking a cigarette in the morning, after walking the dog, after tying your shoes before you leave the house. Hope that helps :)"
"I am not a doctor, or smart.

What steps have you taken in the past couple months to address this?
The road to mental health ""wellness"" is a long and complete shit one to take, but it's better once you do it.

If you don't have money or resources and are feeling helpless, there are free or bill later resources in your state. You've gotta start going to a doctor. If you provide your state I can link you resources that will probably be free."

"Maybe ""blame"" is the wrong word? Perhaps helping oblivious people become more aware of how their dismissiveness could make a suicidal person feel more isolated and generally making things worse? Blame never makes anything better, it isn't productive or constructive. I don't think people simply ""don't care"", but they probably don't know how to care in adequate and effective ways when it comes to dealing with another person's mental health. "
"The thing that is odd about it to me is that I've been out of high school for a couple years now and this is first time the fall weather has made me feel this way. Aside from that it is similar. My high school was all about academics and being an over achiever and everyone was under constant stress. I loved my friends but always felt less than them academically. It was so much more time and effort than college , like I had to be ""on"" 24/7."
"Xanax has been a life-changer for me. It was the first medication my GP prescribed me for anxiety. It was what got me stable enough to find a therapist and to get through the first sessions with her. I have other medications now that I take every day, only using the Xanax as needed, usually 0.5 or 0.25 mg, but those daily meds took a long time to find and a long time to kick in. Xanax was a big part of treatment for me before I found them."

"I have not made any appointments. Lately, I can hardly get out of bed, I feel like giving up, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm from Michigan. I used to like snowboarding and xbox but I don't care for them since I have no friends to do them with anymore. I started going to the gym 3 months ago, I was going 3-4 times a week, lately about twice a week. I'm a sophomore in community college and I'm going to transfer to a university after this year. As far as what I want to do, i guess just something that I hate the least. To be honest, I'm not even sure I'll be alive by the time I'm out of college, started feeling terrible in the spring and it just gets fucking worse and it is my fault

"
"Lol, if you work in mental health, you are definitely not good at your job and probably damage a lot of people. 

But honestly, I don't buy that at all, and it's hilarious that you felt the need to resort to lying. Prove it.

Edit: The irony and hypocrisy of you in your history stating another user ( u/Ryaubee) is not a counselor when they claim to be one and then using the defense of ""well we are on a mental health sub, what do you think most of us do?"" here in this comment train...

So I guess I'll just use my own advice and resort to your own tactics that you have done to another user. Send me your credentials and proof of license. �� Also, I'd like to make a complaint to your work. "
"Thats what im trying to do. I cant just up and relocate without funding. You have to pay for the new place, you have to move your stuff. like if i could afford to move i wouldnt have to put myself on the internet so i can fight through a panic attack while someone questions me about all the things ive already tried. I have no support network here, and its already taking everything i have to even exist. Im not just trying to beg for money from strangers, im trying to prevent a pattern that ive been suffering for for 4 years and TRY and do better. Like i FINALLY have the chance. the only thing that is stopping me right now is that i have to physically move, which requires money.

&amp;#x200B;"
"personally i don’t see an issue with it, as long as you’re not getting toooo much sleep if that makes sense. when i was really depressed or i feel upset sleep helps, for me it fast forwards time and problems that were on my mind would fade, and for a while you don’t think or feel anything really because you’re fast asleep dreaming, it’s nice. but too much sleep can make you feel worse sometimes, for instance if you nap during the day it could make you worse. also just a side note they say 6-8 hours (if i remember the amount correctly) is healthy for you, but i sleep for about 10-12 hours lol. it’s your call at the end of the day, whatever works best for you is the right option. "
"I'm definitely getting less anti-meds (and anti-treatment in general) as life goes on. The older I get, the more I feel like life is too short to not be open minded to something that might result in me living a happier, more fulfilling life.

Maybe a more solid sense of identity (which also comes with age) has helped as well.

I definitely used to think the same as OP and was scared of having an identity crisis if meds made me feel better, worrying that I'd lose track of my true self. But I'm often all over the place anyway, so what's the harm in adding one more version of myself to the mix. It's okay to change, especially if you're happier for it.

I'm hoping I'll be prescribed something soon, just waiting for my first appointment with a psychiatrist. The fact that I'm even seeing one is a big step forward for me as I have been very stubborn in the past and was intent on just learning to live with my problems. I guess we'll see how it goes."
"That article is me 200%.

I show every. single. symptom.

There is an excitement before I even light my candles. Getting my stuff out to burn paper makes me excited, tense, eager to see the flames...then when I light (whatever) on fire, it feels like a celebration...happy, total release, satisfaction. The tension is gone for the moment and the flames are hypnotizing. I just want to have them burn forever. I was just musing today how short-lived the flame was when I was burning the paper towelling. I must have sat there for a good 20 minutes just feeding more and more paper into the fire.

Thank you for the article. Now, how to approach a Psych who I only partially trust with this? I saw another Psych not long ago to discuss my concerns, and he passed that on to my Psych, I am sure, who will ask me about it when I see her in a week and a half. :( I don't want to stop! I don't know how to talk about it. I don't want to say anything to her. :( "
"I am the same exact way with faking a smile in pictures. My friends have pointed out for YEARS why I look so sad or blank faced when I smile in pictures lol. And that is so funny you said that about TV shows or movies because I was going to mention that! I get more emotionally invested in characters than I do about my friends. From what I know about sociopathy, it's a spectrum. So you don't necessarily have to be a full blown sociopath if you relate to a few of the symptoms. I have a bachelors in Criminology but my knowledge only gets me so far. And despite going to therapy, I've never actually admitted any of what is in my post to my therapists. And I have manipulated my therapist once, in order to get out of taking medication when I was hospitalized. But I mean, it's not the worst thing to have done! That's a common trait of mine though, like if I get myself in a bad situation I am always able to talk myself out of it. Even as a kid. It just came naturally and I'm always kind of stunned by others when they aren't? I'm like c'mon haven't you learned what to say by now? I'm not sure if that makes sense. But it's comforting to know I am not alone in some of these feelings! Or lack thereof lol."
"This is a common issue among couples, both long-distance and local. I 100% understand why you would be hesitant to jump on the medication train, but it's good that you're speaking to a professional about it in the first place; it shows that you know you have things to improve upon and room to grow. 

&amp;#x200B;

One part of your post was deeply concerning and I'd like to address it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Now don't get me wrong I want her to go out and have fun with her friends but a selfish scared part of me just wants to keep her close forever and not let go. Of course this is insane and we can't live our lives like that.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm reassured by the fact that you could acknowledge that the first half of this statement was neither realistic nor healthy. Despite that though, that kind of thought process can quickly lead down a road of emotional manipulation, abuse, and/or severe codependency (the latter of which I suggest you look into; again, it's a common problem and very manageable! I've dealt with it myself).

&amp;#x200B;

It also might be worth it to address your agoraphobia (fear of going out), because it could negatively impact your relationship, and frankly, it's already negatively impacting *you* as a person by limiting your experiences. We've only got one life to live, and we should do our best to live it freely. Have you looked into groups for either codependency or agoraphobia? 

&amp;#x200B;

As a woman who has dated people who ""wanted to keep me close forever and not let go"", it's actually quite an uncomfortable position to be in. I imagine that your girlfriend might start feeling guilty for simply going out and having fun. Food for thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck!"
"DBT stands for Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. It is a treatment developed by Marsha Linehan, originally to treat chronically suicidal patients and those with Borderline Personality Disorder. It has since been shown as an effective form treatment for many other diagnoses as well, such as those with PTSD, substance abuse, mood disorders, eating disorders, and ADHD. Those who seek DBT are frequently those who experience intense emotions and emotional distress. It is made up of four components: mindfulness, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance. A typical DBT program consists of a once-weekly 2 hour DBT group that lasts 6-12 months, a once a week therapy session, and the ability for the client to have access to their therapist via phone for phone coaching.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more questions!"
"Makou, you are describing some of the symptoms for many well-known disorders, including both clinical disorders and personality disorders (PDs).  With regard to the *PD symptoms* you list, I agree with  [**u/BlueGreenandPink**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlueGreenandPink) that most are red flags for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

The behaviors you describe -- i.e., verbal abuse, strong fear of abandonment, lack of identity, low self esteem, temper tantrums, desire for drama, black-white thinking, inability to trust, lack of impulse control, and rapid flips between Jekyll (loving his partner) and Hyde (devaluing his partner) -- are classic warning signs for BPD.

Importantly, I'm not suggesting Cacti has full-blown BPD. Only a professional can determine that. Instead, I'm suggesting he may be exhibiting strong BPD symptoms.

I also caution that BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

At issue, then, is not whether Cacti exhibits BPD traits. Of course he does. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether he exhibits those traits at a strong and persistent level (i.e., is on the upper end of the BPD spectrum).

Not having met him, *I cannot answer that question*. I nonetheless believe you can spot any strong BPD warning signs that are present if you take a little time to learn which behaviors are on the list.

&gt;**I understand it's a weird post and confusing.**

The situation likely will be less confusing once you realize that, if Cacti really has a full-blown PD, he likely has several other full-blown disorders as well.  A large-scale American study found that the vast majority of pwBPD also have one or two other co-occurring PDs as well.  See Table 3 at  [2008 Study in JCP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

On top of that, most pwBPD also have two or three clinical disorders:  80% of them have a mood disorder (e.g., bipolar or depression) and 81% also have an anxiety disorder.  It therefore is not surprising that, if Cacti really is a pwBPD, your list of his behavioral traits includes symptoms for sociopathy (ASPD), narcissism (NPD), and bipolar-2 (i.e., the hypomania and depression).

&gt;**I do not need a diagnosis.**

Of course, learning to spot these warning signs will not enable you to diagnose his issues. *Although strong symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.*

Yet, like learning warning signs for breast cancer or a heart attack, learning those for BPD may help your best friend avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., avoid entering into a toxic marriage with an emotionally unstable man.  Learning the red flags also can help her decide when professional guidance is needed.  If she is serious about marrying Cacti, I would recommend that she promptly see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by herself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what she is dealing with.

Significantly, if Cacti really is an untreated pwBPD, the childhood abuse likely froze his emotional development at the level of a four year old -- leaving him fully dependent on the primitive ego defenses used by young children.  These include projection, denial, temper tantrums, black-white thinking, and magical thinking.

&gt;**I do need pointers as to what to research that could explain how all these symptoms coalesce... to explain his erratic and sometimes violent behavior.**

The repeated physical battering of a partner or spouse is strongly  associated with having strong traits of a  personality disorder, particularly BPD.  This is why ""Intense, inappropriate anger"" is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD.     Indeed, the terms ""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,"" and ""unstable"" appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [9 BPD Traits at NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml).

If Cacti is a pwBPD, he carries  enormous anger inside from early childhood.  You therefore don't have  to do a thing to CREATE the anger.  Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor thing that triggers a release of the anger that is already  there.  This is why a pwBPD can burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.  Moreover, he has very  weak control over his emotions.  Indeed, the key defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions.

For these reasons, the *physical* abuse  of a spouse or partner has been found to be strongly associated with  BPD.  One of the first  studies showing that link is a 1993 hospital  study of spousal batterers.  It found that nearly  all of them have a personality disorder and half of them have BPD.  See Roger Melton's summary of that study at [50% of Batterers are BPDers](http://www.sott.net/articles/show/149774-Romeo-s-Bleeding-When-Mr-Right-Turns-Out-To-Be-Mr-Wrong).   Similarly, a [2008 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18281846) and a [2012 study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-012-9479-4#page-1) find a strong association between violence and BPD.

"
I'm looking out for my fellow man. You don't have to think it's as serious as I think it is, but if all you're going to do is blast someone for being concerned about others, just go away."
"&gt; Btw I’m moving back in.

I am not sure this is a good idea.  My therapist says your family can be your greatest asset or your worst liability.  I am leaning towards the latter here."
"Are you asking if anyone should take the meds as the numbness can benefit them

Or are you asking if people with depression should not take them because they “just” cause the numbness?"
"Aye this is a place where you can vent/rant all you need to, say whatever you want to. Sorry you’re in a rough spell right now, hopefully tomorrow will be a day you feel a little better."
"Congratulations. I have nothing else to say, apart from the fact that I am please for you. But, if I am honest, its particularly because of your use of the word 'snazzy' in this context :D"
"Don't get me wrong but accepting that your feeling that way is a good thing, however it feels like you have no desire to do something about it? That's in my opinion the worst advice ever. "
"I BY NO MEANS RECOMMEND DRUG USE, however, indict strains of weed and edibles always have me passed out in an hour. Also unaware of uk laws regarding that so let’s just leave it at that."
I had the same thought about the cars coming toward me...how odd you mention that. I have no advice for you except to talk to someone about this so they can help you through it. Good luck!
"I have lost a couple of my friends and 2 of my sisters to suicide, so I know this first hand. Maybe this is a good idea for him to see others and how they've reacted to losing a loved one."
"I was thinking more along the lines of just letting people know that mental health is complicated and they know nothing, just do that they don’t say dumb stuff thinking they’re experts"
"Idk who his doctor is and we've asked and he says ""what are you talking about?"". But I know he's been somewhere because he took meds once but stopped taking them because they're expensive "
"Im barely angry. Just once a month when things dont go the way i want it to go. 

I can quiet myself in 5-10 seconds. Its not that hard to do. But in those 5 seconds i get extremely angry "
Is it really true that if you go to counselling you can get kicked out of the military? Is this an actual rule or a perception? It seems so unfair and also unethical to do that to someone.
"It’s weird that you’re referring to an adult professional as “girl,” including yourself. Girl means a child, neither you nor this person is a child. Call yourself and her a woman. "
Multiple personality disorder? What you have is definitely a thing. You would have to be seen by a professional and I'm unsure about any medication. Should definitely look into it though.
"No thank you, that made it worse. I subcribed to watchpeopledie in hopes of it. But it didn't work. Thanks for telling me i can just get over it I guess... Like,i havent heard that before."
"Oops I do the ""no problem"" response sometimes. I agree it sounds a bit odd. I've tried changing it more to ""sure thing"" or at least ""no problemo"" so it at least it sounds more playful lol."
"Thank you. Sorry if I seemed over dramatic, I’m just not sure how to handle this. I did have a therapist, but they moved away recently, so I’m sort of in search of a new one right now."
Thanks for the reply.  I definitely felt I needed help as I was freaking out for a while there.  I am also happy that my shrink thinks I should get over this in a short amount of time.
"That sounds so awful and scary.

You need to see a physician right away. This may be a mental health issue but it could be a physical health issue and nobody on the Internet can tell you. "
Therapy is about change.  The difference may be how that change is enacted.  My last therapist was good but a little too New Agey for me.  I recently switched to a therapist more my style.
"Therapy is not going to work the way you think it does. Therapy doesn’t make this better. Therapy helps you feel less distressed about it.  

Edit: I’m missing ages 7 to 14- I gets it "
"Try to think of work, jobs, or tasks that your weaknesses are actually strenghts. Brainstorm and see what you come up with. 

What about taskrabbit, where you do tasks for people and go?  "
"Unfortunately I am dealing with something even odder, weirder, and more serious than self-harming now.  


Keep your head up, friend. :) You are amazing and I hope things do get better. :)"
Yeah that’s the worst part. Knowing what you’re doing isn’t good but it’s the only thing that helps. I’ll keep you in my thoughts. We will get past this. No feeling is permanent
You are scared because of one individual’s experience? There are many others who got help from therapy too. It’s all in your head. You will never know until you go for an appointment.
"You need a therapist versed in sexual trauma, not a sex therapist. 

You need to come to livable terms with the trauma you experienced before you can begin to like your body and yourself. "
i do this a lot. Only in my head. Kinda like there's a disconnect between my brain and body to my sub conscience and its very weird. Like I don't agree with anything that in doing it enjoy
"He explained negative symptoms can look like depression and antidepressants (which I’m also on) cover them up and I explained some possible negative symptoms to him and he reassured me that’s what they are. I guess it’s not depression because as he said, I already have psychosis outside of mood episodes. I suppose I’m still in denial

And I suppose you’re right, thankfully the treatment isn’t different from my bipolar treatment "
"Hey just go ahead and take a few deep breaths for me, nice and slow. I have some good news for you, you can't be insane if you think you are insane so you aren't. Also, it sounds like you may be suffering from depersonalization/ derealization or perhaps dissociation, you aren't just crazy. These are problems that can be addressed with some help from a therapist. Things can get better but it will take time and some help. Hang in there ��"
"I do.

Never had many friends after elementary school because my classmates were all growing up, and I wasn't. I didn't know how to relate to them or be social. I was horribly bullied because of it, and now...I am even more messed up. Depression, suicide attempts in the past (none recently and most definitely none planned), Anorexia Nervosa, self-harm, and now...pyromania.   


My life has been hell, but I still think it is worth living. :)"
If he uses reddit (or you can teach him to use it) he could visit r/schizophrenia for support. It's for all psychotic people. Other than that just be there for him. Listen to him. Encourage him to take his medication if he is reluctant. Try to encourage him to stop using drugs as they're really bad for psychotic people. There is a thing called drug-induced psychosis.  It could be that your brother's symptoms are worse because of the drugs.
"It took 4 tries before I finally found a therapist that worked for me. The first one was downright harmful. The second one was helpful for about 6 months, then we kinda just got stuck and things weren't getting better. The third one was simply useless and we never connected. And the fourth one I've been seeing for over 4 years. I've learned and grown so much and we have such a great rapport. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep looking you'll find someone!"
"They are valid. There’s no way you’re the only person on planet Earth who thinks in the way you do. I promise. A therapist’s role is to open-minder listen, analyze, and provide positive feedback. Opening up to one can be difficult and painful, but it’s an important way to understand yourself and your underlying thought patterns that contribute to whatever negative emotions you are experiencing!! Give it a solid try to be vulnerable "
"A pretty deep root of my issues is having thoughts of violence towards myself or others and very early on my parents simply said... ""No you don't you're a good person""

You can imagine the effect this had on me. 25 year later I learn everyone has these thoughts and you can only just let them be...

It sounds like you have more going on so it's good you're seeing someone, but just wanted to share cause not everyone learns this right away but everyone has messed up thoughts like that and if you think you're the only one it can really, really tilt you.

Like the end of A Beautiful Mind when he's made peace with his hallucinations. You aren't your thoughts... Thoughts and feelings are temporary."
"Airing them helps me to come to terms with my emotions. Sometimes I’ll type or say something about the situation from an angle I haven’t considered.

What’s your reason for only talking to male therapists? My thinking is that females might be better at understand her side of things as she has a really bad way of expressing herself and part of the problem is not knowing went so catastrophically wrong in her eyes.

I’m trying to put all my catharsis into my band and my music. It gives me something to focus on. I know I don’t need a companion, but humans are programmed to want companionship, and id much prefer to be sharing my accomplishments and visions with someone, rather than not."
"I dont have social anxiety, but i was extremely socially inept in elementary and early middle school because i was home schooled until 2nd grade. I didnt have any friends and going out of my comfort zone was a NO go and meeting people gave me awful anxiety. I slowly learned to really just not care. Care less about other peoples actions, care less about what you say and do, of course to a certain extent you dont want to completely not care. It sounds simple but takes time. Maybe try to slowly push yourself out of your comfort zone and hopefully, over time youll feel better about going out. Now im really extroverted and have friends, but it did take a long time. I do hope i helped you any way!"
"This is me exactly. So fucking embarrassing. And it's not just me saying the words its like I'm trying to physically fight the memories away. My partner understands that I have a constant loop of horrible shit in my head and understands that sometimes I talk to myself, but will let me know when it gets excessive. I didn't mind it at first, because I use it like a grounding exercise (like the table is brown, the rug is red) but ffs...I'm getting back on my meds and going to see my therapist again. I'm really hoping that getting help ""for real this time"" will help me manage my stress better. 

I hope you're doing a lot better now and thank you for your reply and letting me know I'm not alone. "
"You need to get help, and I'm glad you recognize that.

I don't know what to advise you on the legal/CPS issue. I am not a lawyer and I don't know where you live.

It is possible you could seek help for anger management problems without getting into the details, but again, I don't know.

Regardless of the consequences, you MUST seek help, because the consequences of not doing so will be worse -- and not just for you, who is not the most important person in this scenario. If you have access to any legal resources you can speak with in confidence, use them. But whatever you do, make every effort to ensure this never happens again, even if it requiers you being away from your family for a time."
"I wonder what I could have achieved without mental illness. I’m fairly smart. Can excel academically when I put my mind to it. But my anxiety seems to put a stop to that. My school has a disability office, which I am registered with, but what they can do is limited. They really have not helped me much. 

I am happy now. My anti anxiety meds work to a point. But I stopped taking them suddenly because I’m an idiot and it put me into a depressive episode. Fuck, I forgot how all encompassing depression is to everything I do. The inability to focus on anything is scary. I wanted to cry if anyone raised their voice, even in a casual conversation. I just wanted to lay on the couch, yuck anything else. That was me for most of my twenties. When other people were graduating college I was cutting myself and trying to make myself shower. 

What is that didn’t happen? What if I went to school and graduated? Got a good job? Maybe went to grad school?"
"You’re me with friends and a boyfriend (wait I’m a guy). I actually just posted something like this a few minutes ago after I googled some personality disorders, see if [this](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/avoidant-personality-disorder/) relates to you at all. For me, it checked all the boxes. It’s good you do have a friend group though, I feel like the reason I don’t is because I push everyone away because they are not as genuine when talking to me it’s like I’m not really a friend but someone they are trying to help. This is sexist, but I think it’s harder to make friends and get a boyfriend/girlfriend as a guy because shyness and insecurity is not generally a masculine trait, but on girls it is probably favorable to the opposite a brash and prideful. Sorry I’m venting too on your post, I can’t really say anything on how to fix it because I’m in a similar situation, but just wanted to know there are others like you."
"Good to know.  I personally don't care if you do or don't, but substance-induced psychosis is quite common.  Since you characterized your psychosis as ""casual,"" I had to wonder.  I've never heard anyone refer to symptoms of psychosis as ""casual"" before, but I suppose they would equate to 'mild' in terms of severity.

Psychotic symptoms manifest differently in everyone, but it's not too often that their occurrence isn't an interference or bothersome.  Most people find them distressing, and they can have a significant impact on your quality of life.  

May I ask what sorts of symptoms you're experiencing?  I can only imagine how alone you must in this, not knowing who to talk to or how much to reveal.  I can understand your fear, but I strongly, strongly encourage you to be completely honest and forthright about your symptoms with your doctor, the evaluator, treatment team, whomever is involved in your care.  

It sounds like this evaluation is going to assist providers in their development of a treatment plan, which will possibly include medication.  Psychiatrists have an array of medications they prescribe that work better on some symptoms more than others.  Being honest will allow them to see the entire picture and proceed from there.  Additionally, the earlier you treat these symptoms and get them under control, the better the prognosis.  If left unaddressed, your mental status may continue to deteriorate.  Are you willing to risk that?

"My boyfriend is kind of similar, and I fundamentally agree with u/Combinatorilliance on their post. Something I want to emphasize is that you are being verbally abused, manipulated, and controlled, and that's not ok.

I hate it when people say ""just leave him"" because it's not that easy, even when I have openly admitted to myself, to him, and to my counselor that what he is doing is verbal abuse. I kept thinking he'll want to get better, but he doesn't. I excused his behavior for a long time thinking ""the majority of our relationship wasn't like this. It'll go back."" But I realized - do I want to put up with this until that's no longer the case? I don't. I don't want tbat for you, either, because we both deserve better.

I know you love him, because I love my boyfriend, and I know you want to help him, because I want to help mine. But to what end? I am fighting to keep my job right now because of how shitty of an employee I've become trying to ""help"" him. I went to the hospital on suicide watch for a week because in all of my concern for him I didn't take care of myself. And through all of this he hasn't gone back to being the person I fell for, and I don't think he ever will. If I'm not enough to convince him he needs help, he needs to come to that conclusion on his own. 

Same goes for you. It's not your responsibility to fix him or understand him, it's your responsibility to listen and lend a hand when he asks for it. But if he won't do the same for you, you need to take care of yourself before you lose your house, your job, and your relationships like what happened to me. I'm finally trying to leave him, and it's really hard. He's not making it easy. I really hope you don't end up like this."
"oh yeah me too you know!

&amp;#x200B;

Jk just trying to get a smile out. I'm sorry you feel that way. I have a friend who has a similar problem. It's hard to help him because 1)It doesn't happen to me at the moment (and I'm not extroverted at all, mind you, but I'm a person with very few close friends and that's it). 2) It's hard to tell what's going on with the other people, why aren't they reaching out. Because consider it might not be YOU, it's THEM. You just happen to be in a place where you just don't have a ton in common with anyone, I mean it CAN happen. From like 8 y/o till I was 14, I didn't have friends at school. I wasn't bullied or anything but I didn't connect with anyone. I don't remember it affecting me too much, if anything I had better grades because I didn't get distracted. I was pretty young back then though. Then the last three years of HS I made my circle of friends and it was totally different. There wasn't anything wrong with me, I was just among people that had absolutely nothing in common with me.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you like to do, what are your interests? Just because you go to group activities doesn't mean there's gonna be people you connect with. Don't give up. Keep trying other groups. Also activities that force you to interact with others, not a yoga class where nobody talks to nobody. If it's an ongoing thing where you see the same faces even better.

&amp;#x200B;

In the unlikely event that it IS you in some way, what makes you think you don't add value to anyones life? Are you a cronic-complainer? ultra negative? annoying AF? make offensive, bad taste jokes? If you answer no to those it's not you.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps start some thought, at least."
Do some research on Existential Death Anxiety and Disassociative Disorder. You and I have a lot in common and after a lot of hard work those are the two I've been able to best come up with
Get some baby wipes and dry shampoo for days when you just can’t get in the shower. Try to brush your teeth at least every morning but have some strong mints or gum on hand just in case.
"Given that you were already doing this in some of the other subreddits where you've been spamming this survey, why didn't this one merit that courtesy and why should anyone believe you now?"
"How long have you felt like this? Mortality anxiety is a relatively normal thing, but it depends how much it's affecting your mental health and whether it's worth speaking to someone about."
"I also must thank you because I was starting to accept that I will never get better and be a parasite to family and friends. 

Thank you kindly and I will try seeking out a psychotherapist."
I dont know about you but when im in a maniac state i see people standing right besides me when i try to sleep at night and ive beed scare shitless a couple of times. Is it the same to you?
"I exercise every day. I'm quite buff haha�� when I'm sad or something it makes me happy. Oh my ""hypomania""is always after exercise. I searched it up and it could just be a runners high "
"I see,  that's rather confusing since you said ""....unaware that college students in today's economy..."" implying you were one.  It seems the other advice will suit you better.  Good luck. "
"I suffered from Anorexia Nervosa--Purging Type so I can relate to this. No matter now little I ate, I would purge it. Just remember it's a new day...start over. :) Sending you lots of hugs."
"If you go for a tryout, then sure.

Diagnoses, while have a decent to high price, are valuable in the long-term, so go for it! Don't post here expecting various useful answers, dear fellow."
"If you refuse any type of change youll get nowhere, a little change here and there does a big difference you dont have to be what they tell you you just need to change it your way not their"
"It's okay to be confused. But please don't hurt people like that again. If you really need somebody to talk to, just send me a message. It'll feel good to get this stuff out of your system."
It’s good you recognize it and want to change it though. That’s the first step. Some people don’t want to change or even realize they’re behavior is very apathetic. So kudos to you
Just make sure that you tell them everything. Don't leave out any important details. The only way that they can help you properly is by being completely honest with them about how you feel.
My therapist said that a few weeks ago and I hadn’t really thought that he would come through it as a different person. It’s frightening. I just want him to talk to me. Hopefully soon.
"Oh my God, this was exactly what I was gonna say. I was in the same state at one point in my life. Thought myself to code and it has changed my life. I'm the one who supports my family now."
"People get better all the time! I truly believe with the right therapist, medication combination, and hard work, every single person w mental illness can recover and live a meaningful life "
Reach out...please. I have been there and it can get easier and better. You need to be surrounded with people who do care and who will help you find your way. You can message me anytime OK?
"Sadly my breaks from the world usually involves going into the mental hospital to get my meds changed.

I did do some mental rehab for 4 months.  It was nice to take time away from my life."
"Silly me, I forgot to mention that I can't do that because I don't have insurance, and I live in the US, so doctors won't see me unless I pay them upfront. Haha, God bless the USA, amirite?"
That's basically why I feel owning a gun is a bad idea for most people.  Everyone goes through bad times.  The harder/scarier your suicide options are the more likely you'll get through it
Yes absolutely. A recurring thing in my life has been to help people who have tried to or tolls me they wanted to commit suicide. It leaves a mark on you that might develop into something.
"Yes, but that is a symptom of depression, blaming the environment for holding you captive, for not realising your dreams, for not taking care of you, etc... I know cos I do the same thing. "
You need to get these mean thoughts out of your system. Get yourself into therapy if you haven't already. You don't want to spend the rest of your life being a dickhead. It's a lonely life.
"You sound like an empath like myself. It is nice sometimes to be so tuned in to feelings around you, but then again, it gets overwhelming too. I get ya. Feel free to message me at any time."
"Hey, thanks for asking. Well I went to the doctor and got put on Paxil about a week ago, but I don’t feel any different yet. I know it can take 3-4 weeks or whatever, but still. Everyone is checking up on me a lot more, which gets annoying but at least I know they love me��‍♂️. Overall I’m doing better I guess. It feels better to have it off my chest and to know I’m getting treated for it. I just wish it would happen quicker."
"I say ""no problem"" because my mom and my boyfriend constantly said *you're welcome* to me sarcastically. Now when I say ""you're welcome"" to other people I think it sounds like I'm being sarcastic or rude. I think other people pick up on the fact that I feel uncomfortable saying it and that makes them think that I resented doing them a favor. I'm trying to switch back because I hear people complain about the phrase ""no problem"" all the time. "
"I think the key is to learn where the anxiety comes from. I developed social anxiety very young due to bullying. For years I assumed nobody would really like me, or that I'd never find love. It took a lot of self discipline and learning about myself to realize I'm more than what other people think about me. I'm married to the man of my dreams and I'm doing really well. I have my moments, but I can recognize them and dismiss them accordingly."
"The hell of it is that people ignore your messages, dont reply back to comments on FB and pretty much forget about you (unless they need something) ... Then if you were to pass away or get really sick they would be ""oohhhh! Why did this happen! We were sooooooo close!"" Etc. I hate this more than anything. 

I am so sorry you're struggling. Please message me OK if you feel like you need to chat. We can chat about anything you want. Take care."
"I think people bandy the term around and dont really understand what it is, or how to do it. Its sort of become fashionable, but only in a very surface sense. 

It did work for me. But I spent about 2 years studying at a local buddhist centre, meditated up to 90 mins a day, and attended a number of retreats. Before doing that, I was very unwell with anxiety. After it, I no longer had issues with it. 

It didnt help with social avoidance or depression so much, but it has offered other quality of life benefits. 

I would suggest, if you want to get into 'mindfulness' to look at the deeper, established aspects. There is more to it than trendy buzzwords, and popular misappropriation. 

Good luck "
"I was with someone for exactly a year and he was acting so weird, he told me I made him miserable, he didn't love me and he was scared to break up with me because he was afraid of the outcome it might bring for me. I felt horrible for months afterwards, it's happened several times to me so I know the feeling, I'm so sorry this happened to you, I'm sure you're not ""too broken"" so try not to think that, even though that's hard to do. Honestly, at this point of my short life I've lived, if people don't want to be with you, they won't, and in the long run, it's totally worth it. I know it's hard but I believe you got this and you'll pull through eventually, I hope things do get better for you ❤"
"Thank you, I guess I should have realized those were my main options. I'm sorry that you had to go through this with your mother as well.

I guess I'll see if I can convince her to get help first, though I don't imagine that will go well. I don't feel like she's really a danger to anyone. She's just emotionally abusive, I guess. I've learned to just kind of shut down and ignore it, but with school right now it just feels like too much. I have to move again for school next year, so I guess if all else fails then I'll just make sure that she realizes she's not coming with me

Thank you again for the advice. It feels good just to have someone else's input and not feel quite so alone with it all!"
"I haven't thought of autism. My cousins, too, are autistic. Though one has mild autism with cerebral palsy and the other has relatively severe aspergers, they're both clearly autistic. I, however, am not. I can look people in the eye, though I don't feel comfortable with it completely. I understand a lot of social nuances, though I've been told I'm pretty blunt sometimes and I don't really get the whole:

""I'm sad.""

""Why are you sad?""

""I don't want to talk about it.""

That doesn't make sense. Why say it in the first place if you don't want to talk about it? Or when I want to go do something and then they get mad at me for doing said thing, even though they said they didn't want to do the thing with me. Like, why say that you don't care if I go to the mall with some friends, but then you get mad at me when I go? I don't understand that. Just say what you mean to say, don't beat around the bush because *I don't understand that stuff.* So I guess I don't understand those social nuances.

However, I can understand facial expressions perfectly fine, or so I think.

So I might have autism but I'm just not sure. At all...

Thank you for your reply, though. I appreciate the thought you put into this."
"I think I know how you feel. I had very similar mental and physical issues myself.

Please don't be me. Go to a professional ASAP. I waited two years before telling anyone that I was feeling sick every day, only ate once every one/two days, etc.  


Even though I'm getting better and am a lot better then I was, my main regret has been waiting so long before talking about it.  


I get it though, it's hard talking about something so intimate and personal with someone else. Especially if you don't really know them. And you will end up feeling emberassed and anxious during and leading up to getting help. But remember, you're not alone! There are many, many a people with similar problems in the world and trust me when I say that you won't surprise them, no matter how much you might think you will.  


If you do end up getting help I have one final piece of advice to give you.  
Try to be as complete and honest as you can be. Every little detail you might miss about your troubles will eventually come to light anyways, but the longer it takes, the longer you have to deal with it. So try to be as open and honest as you can be while in therapy.  


Wether you go this route or not, I wish you good luck in the rest of your days.  
And if you decide not to get help, try quitting weed for a week. For me it got worse at first, but after three-four days the paranoid feelings almost completely dissapeared (the other issues didn't though, so keep that in mind)."
"I can work some with low stress, low distraction jobs that have a schedule that isn't too much, which means not making much money, but I can't use my Master's degree. So I'm not really sure."
I don’t think so but if you’re suicidal please make staying alive your most important objective and call. If you’ve decided to kill yourself and have a specific plan call 911 instead.
"I have taken breaks, but no matter how I run or try to rationalize this, I enter a mini breakdown mode where I have to alter my mind in some way. I am just so damned tired of being the hero."

"I started tripping when you said the brain is a chemical fucking puzzle, I wish I could figure mine out so I can at least live normal day to day life... I just feel like giving everything up"
Idk the exact forms but ik my depression and anxiety are one of the more severe ones. Also for the bipolar its very minimal(isnt very prominant). And yes theyve been professionally diagnosed
"If you’re near any local colleges, contact their psych department bc they could possibly offer therapy on a sliding scale payment depending on your income. My sessions are 30 bucks a piece"
Im also happy for you. I know I waited until it was almost too late. You've got a long road to recovery but I got a good feeling about you. Focus on getting better. Everything else can wait.
"I’ve heard this argument before, but I just can’t come to terms with it. It makes things hard because I want some kind of inner peace or acceptance but I just can’t seem to reach that."
Not all mental health meds. Antidepressants do that but stuff like diazepam and anti psychotics just change the way signals are sent not boosting chemicals that are absent or low. It sucks.
So then how do I bring it up again? Should I wait a few more sessions? I didn’t think not having one would bother me but I’m finding that it is. I don’t seem him again for another week
"Thank you for the input, I greatly appreciate that. I would like to be able to do a lot of the things I find myself unable to. Seeking a professional seems like it may be a good idea for me."
"When I started having auditory hallucinations the first abnormal thing I heard was the Super Mario Brothers song over and over. 

Then came the voices.. and well, that’s another story lol "
You are scared because of one individual’s experience? There are many others who got helped from therapy too. It’s all in your head. You will never know until you go for an appointment.
i dont believe anything bad happened but i still have consequences from it. i still have panic attacks and cant sleep. i havent slept through the night in 15 years. no matter what logic says
"Honestly after pondering over it a little bit I think I might be autistic, my psychiatrist wasn't entirely sure what I had. I don't exhibit some of the symptoms of ADHD, such as hyperactivity, or compulsiveness, I was always a fairly quite child at school. I could have SCT, but that's still a theoretical condition for now.  On one IQ ''test'' I scored 40 points .. so that cant be right . I'm just as confused by my self as my psychiatrist was."
"I think my only issue with it that extends past motivation issues is that it's sudden. I'll be great for a time and then the next day I don't do anything. I've shut out friends for no reason for months at a time. It was a little better when I was working because I had to constantly be out of my comfort zone. Even then, I would feel great for a while and then have that one week occasionally where I just didn't care what was happening around me"
"The therapist will try and work heir way through text to phone to video with you. As they know video is the best. 

You can message them whenever but that doesn’t mean they are always one it, many therapists on there have set hours they are on the website and are checking messages. 

I use it, perfect for me. But I can see how it’s not helpful for others and they should integrate a better system when they can’t accept you as a patient. "
"This might be totally wrong but do you get migraines? Migraines can do a lot of stuff to your brain. Visual auras, tunnel vision, vertigo, nausea, even olfactory hallucinations I think. There are a lot of peripheral things that happen along with Migraines besides the headache part. Sometimes I get just the Migraine symptoms without the headache (which sounds like a win, and is because it's less debilitating but it's still very uncomfortable)."
"Don't feel bad, I've been working alone for the past 10 years, (I have had co works, but it's 99% solo work), having full conversations with yourself isn't really a bad thing, you will get funny looks but if your doing it to keep your head straight it helps, my advise from personal experience is to get a headset and some friends you can chat up, I started it out of boredom, and having a mental, or emotional stimulant can help to mitigate it. If that isn't an option well take option two if your worried about other peoples perspective, tell em it's a bad habit you can't break. I still use that one.

But ultimately unless the perspective coming from you to you is more like spd I wouldn't stress. "
"i am EXACTLY the sane way, you may want to look into neurofeedback therapy. if you have complex ptsd or developmental trauma, quite literally your brain is wired incorrectly and physically different than normal brains. those affected have larger amygdalas, too. and i know because i am one of those people! i feel the exact same way- that i have two ""brains"" inside of me- my ""evil brain"" and my ""striving-to-be-normal brain"" who battle each other constantly. having a complete inability to control the fear response (trigger) and fight-or-flight mode is not something that can be undone with just talk therapy and behavior modification. i've heard EMDR can work too but i would look into neurofeedback"
"BTW I have known people who got advanced college degrees, got married, had happy healthy kids, successful careers, etc... and they still felt they were worthless. That's what depression does."
"Because people fear what they don't understand, and running is an instinctive reaction to fear.

"Depends on the sound, or if there's too much sound. I find my tics get worse when I'm overstimulated and there's too much, or if a particular sound is really awful (nails on chalkboard-type)."
"Hang in there. College is when my mental health started to go wrong as well. It took me quite a while to get somewhat stable, but I think that putting off getting help was a big part of that."
I agree. I've been to mental hospitals a few times before. They've all been decent enough in my opinion. Don't be afraid to go to one if necessary. And don't be afraid to get help in general.
"I think it may be their way trying to ""motivate"" the rest of you to work harder which well, probably isn't a great way -- everyone is different and has their own talents/weaknesses, you know."

Have you been diagnosed with any mental health issues? 

Has anything been going on at school that may have brought your depression on?  "

"I most certainly could. There are a few resources available for me to try. The unnerving part for me is just that I can't find much info about the Canadian funded sites/associations for telepsychology. It almost seems like most Canadians don't do it, or just don't really talk about it. Most places don't have many reviews. I could also use an American site technically, but if I ever needed to be prescribed anything it wouldn't be transferable. "
"I'm good, right now :p 

Not so much earlier today my self and the night still young LOL 

I hate that question as a greeting too. Especially since most of the time I have hard time not being honest. Instead of just lying and saying good, I often start spilling beans and make people uncomfortable, which I'm very good at. 

Speaking of feeling uncomfortable.. I got really confused for a minute because my mom's name IS Linda spelled with a Y tho"
"It does seem pretty helpful, from that perspective at least. I might consider trying it if this problem persists further down the road or so. I could use someone directing me organization-wise, I can see how that might impact a lot of other things. Thank you for your reply, and it being thorough is exactly what I wanted. You don't have to answer if you'd rather not, but do you have any idea how much would this cost per appointment, or monthly?"
It obviously seems to be a problem for her. literally the signs of a toxic relationship are here. Making her delete her friends on social media? Possessive? That’s textbook toxic behavior ���� Just because she hasn’t broken up with her doesn’t mean it’s not a problem for her. Smh. Don’t tell me I don’t have sympathy because I’m looking out for her. Lots of people don’t seem to realize their relationship is no good. Smh
"Sorry you feel this way. I understand completely. Given my and my family history of mental health, eating disorders and substance abuse ive decided not to have kids and my brother who has 2 kids has expressed concern despite the fact he has never personally suffered. All i can say is thankfully medicine keeps progressing and societal stigma is slowly decreasing. Hopefully you can use your life experience to help your kids thru their struggles."
"The sad reality is that unless you break down and show these emotions, most people probably won't take you too seriously. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying that from my own personal experience. They might think you're doing better but the truth is that people can still be depressed or suicidal even while putting on a happy face. Just keep going to your doctor's appointments. Besides that, there's not much else you can do about it."
"There needs to be a little compromise. Does any part of your schedule allow for family time? If so, put it there. Then when they approach, tell them, ""I'm sorry, I was planning on studying/working/etc. right now but later I can spend some time with you."" Basically just leave a chunk of time unaccounted for in your day and move it into whatever space they want to fill, but be sure to let them know that you also have other things you need to do."
"I meant to mention in my last reply that I have been listening to a new audiobook: Back, After the Break by Osher Günsberg

I have listened to more now and highly recommend you give it a listen, he has a lot of similar issues. You can get the first book free with an audible trial

Osher Gunsberg is one of Australia's most loved radio and tv presenters. He is very honest and open about his life and the way he has learned to manage his ""different brain"". He intelligently and thoughtfully but still in a matter of fact way explains strategies he uses without implying quick fixes or one size fits all. 

I think in this new climate the way people are opening up about their struggles is so refreshing"
"I've been to mental hospitals before so I know how the follow up evaluation goes. Is there a chance that you'll be put back in? Yeah there is a chance. But it's also probably unlikely too.

I know that you're afraid to be hospitalized again, but you still need to be honest with your doctor. Otherwise you'll never get better. I've been to mental hospitals 4 times in my life. Three of them were voluntary and one was involuntary.

If for whatever reason they force you back into the hospital, then there's not much you can do about it. I highly doubt you'll be hospitalized against your will. But you still need to be honest when talking to your psychiatrist. It's the only way you'll ever get better.
"
"Yes anxiety can make you feel the way you are. 

You can make yourself get stomach ulcers, vomit/nausea, headaches and migraines, high blood pressure, rashes with anxiety. Personally, my anxiety leads to migraines and rashes. 

You are spending time obsessing over your body’s normal functions. Your heart rate will increase when you take a walk. And that can be scary because your heart rate goes up when you have anxiety. I avoid working out because it reminds me of panic attacks! Very bad. But I understand that is the reason and I’m working to overcome it. 

Recognize why you are obsessing on your body functions and understand that your mind and body are more connected then you might think. "
"Have you ever thought of autism. Perhaps that is the overlying issue. You may have anxiety or OCD, but that's a symptom of the larger picture: autism. It makes sense. You can't handle huge stressors, and they're specific. Emotion frustrates and confuses you. Do you have trouble with social nuances? Do you have difficulties looking people in the eyes or understanding facial expressions? My cousins have autism, both with aspergers. While their symptoms are ""severe"" and they are deemed as ""low functioning autistic people"", to put it crudely, you might just have ""high functioning autism"". There are those who have gone their entire lives without knowing they have autism, and it causes them incredible stress, and when they find out, they have an ""ah hah"" moment, because it all clicks. It all makes sense. You know? Maybe check that out? Everyone's different, and you'll need a professional's opinion first, but it could be worth looking in to. Good luck."
"You should be proud for making it so far. That's great! But you're right that it might be time to seek treatment again. There isn't always something that triggers a major depressive episode but definitely things that can contribute. Dont feel bad that you don't have something that triggered it. And I think you're right that being more isolated and lonely hasn't been good for you. Is there anyway you can connect with other people? Any hobby or groups around that you might be interested in? Could be a religious group, cross fit, yoga, or anything. I've personally found things like that very helpful. I experienced some difficult times while living abroad and as ridiculous as it may sound joining a frisbee group was a lifesaver for me. Either way, best of luck to you in your decisions. I know stopping medications isn't easy. But don't let that keep you from getting help if you need it. You've stopped before and you can do it again if you decide to. "
"I’m gonna go ahead and use y’all as a diary some more. Do you know who Chris Cornell was? When my older brother still lived with me, him and I would listen to his music (soundgarden, audioslave, temple of the dog mostly. We listened to other bands as well. Mostly grunge and punk and heavy metal.) and play Xbox and talk a little. We hated each other for a very long time, until he was in 11th grade then he started being really nice and quickly one of my best friends. Hanging out with him was the highlight of my day or week or however often we got to do it. It was a really great last 2 years with him, but he’s moved out and graduated college and moving on with his own life now. Anyways, I’ve had such a connection with Chris Cornell’s music my whole child hood and then those last few years made me love him even more. When Chris Cornell killed himself, I cried. I put on his music and felt so much nostalgia and pain rush through me, and I missed him and those years with my brother before he left. I thought I had listened to all of his music and had it downloaded, but a few days ago I found a song called “you never knew my mind” by him. It is so damn beautiful and I’ve listened to it about a dozen times today, while I was low. I don’t know if that’s your type of music, but have you ever heard it? What do you think about it?

I’ve wanted to tell people about it but I don’t think anyone I know would like it, except my older brother "
"I am also someone who grew up with PTSD and suffers from psychosis, to the extent where I feel it contributed to my parents divorce. The life our families have is unfair beyond what most people can comprehend. Your father loved you and would have never blamed you for his death, he cared even if he perhaps didn't show it in the ways he should have. 

I think one of the most important things that I learned was that my parents were mentally struggling as well, and it was the reason that they were neglectful and didn't know how to properly handle what PTSD does to someone, much less their own child. I hold a lot of resentment for my mother, for what she said and how she blamed me for things I had no control over. I've come to terms with this anger, I don't let it consume me, but I acknowledge my feelings of hurt and anger are still valid.

Your mother is wrong, regardless of whether or not she is struggling as heavily as you are doesn't excuse her actions. You are not the reason your father died, the world took him and that is the end of it. It's unfortunate and heartbreaking, the grief of losing a parent is not something anyone can just avoid. A new level of depression is what's healthy, as much as it sucks when you feel like you've only been sad. Mourning is ugly, and your situation is more than any person deserves to go through. Let yourself be sad, let yourself mourn, your emotions are valid. Just don't let them consume you, take these emotions and use them to float rather than let them sink you. Your fight's not over, but you've been in the ring so long that it's become hard to stand. Take a breather, get back up when you're ready to start swinging again. As long as you keep fighting you will win."

"Find ones close to you, gender you want, that take your insurance. Some of them might have websites, you need to google them and find out. Also ask for references if you have friends/family that go to a therapist.  Also there are large practices with many therapists so you can ask them to match you based on preferences or speciality.

I pointed out that he doesn't know if I am male or female, 14 or 40, and that he is praying on people on a mental health subreddit. He threatened me with physical violence. "
I don’t know to what extent you are binge eating but if you are experiencing an eating disorder as well this can make things even more difficult so it is not surprising you feel like things are getting worse. I would definitely try and get some help specific to eating disorders because a lot of therapists do not have appropriate experience in this. I would definitely try other medications if you have not had success with some as it can take years to try and find the right one. Life is a struggle but try and identify the things you value and enjoy (well used to as am guessing you probably don’t enjoy anything at all right now) and focus on those things. Forget everything else for the moment.

"Just wanted to reach out because this is not a well known fact. In the mental health system, one can consent to treatment at 14 (at least in certain states and I looked it up, Michigan is one of them). Therefore, it can still be difficult as there is the insurance aspect but a 17 year old can consent to treatment without a parent's consent. It would still show up on insurance that the services are being rendered but that is all. Also, some schools have school-based services. While there are the guidance counselors, some schools have outside service providers come in and provide regular individual therapy during the school day. That way you wouldn't have to try and find a way to get to sessions. "

Just wondering what would you like to happen if you do express suicidal ideation, other than them sharing resources available within the company and possible remedies.

"Don’t be sorry! I completely understand what you’re saying. I can relate to you in what you’re saying about physical touch being your love language, and how you express that. 

I’m not sure if it I have any specific advice, but I can tell you that I (F26) express love to my daughter (3) and my partner (F28) in much the same way, with the exception of sexual things - we hug, snuggle, play with hair, rub backs, spoon, kiss on cheeks and forehead. I think that that’s not unusual. I have never once had a sexual thought towards my daughter, because I know that those relationships are different. In addition, completely apart from physical affection, your emotional relationship with partner and child will set them apart. You depend on your partner for emotional support in a way you do not depend on your child. Same with decision making. You discuss different things with partner/child. All of these add up to make sex seem normal with your partner and unthinkable with your child.

If you have a child and this does come up, then you should absolutely seek professional support. But I genuinely believe that, as hard as it is to imagine now, that once you have a child everything will feel different. "
"I feel you (I am M/20), the social pressure of being successful and being in a relationship can be really disheartening especially when you are just starting your life. 

Emotions and logic thoughts rarely mix, and often contradict each other, which causes distress and dissonance.  You can't just force bad emotions to go away because that will, unfortunately, make them stronger. You having these emotions is not your fault, however you can take responsibility for them.

Look for a therapist, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is all about restructuring your thought process into one more beneficial for yourself. Sessions are essentially a class where you learn skills and apply them to the outside world. 

Also, build a support network, or utilize it if you already have one, I cannot tell you enough how much it helps with your self confidence and recovery. If you can afford it, a personal trainer will work wonders with keeping on a healthy diet and exercise plan, your friends and family will definitely be there for you as you move forward more and more.

I am just starting my journey, so I am full of bad habits that I have to overcome. 

I hope you find your way and I wish you well!"
"I think your auto correct needs to be adjusted. I'm sure you meant ""One Step Forward"". Coming here to Reddit to share with us how you feel is definitely a step in the right direction. When battling depression and anxiety, people often assume there is a cut and dry problem that can be fixed. When someone say's they are depressed, and can't give a reason, they are considered drama queens and attention seekers. Let me tell you...You are 100% OK. Nothing is wrong with you. YOU are normal to feel the way you do. I personally have fought depression since age 11. I remember that's the first time I ever thought ""I don't want to hurt myself, but I wish I wasn't alive"". I'm 32 now, and I still often feel this, during good times and bad.

​

The fix unfortunately is to find a mask that fits you. Meds, Drugs? Your family? Your friends? School or work? We all must wear masks at times to help distract us from ourselves. ""You are your own worst enemy"" couldn't be anymore true when it comes to Mental Illness. Distract yourself using the things you do enjoy, and write down the things you want to accomplish. Take each day step by step and never forget what you're doing it for. You may never be as happy as you wish you could be...cause the truth is, some people simply cannot be happy. But you can try your best to get god damn close.

You need to go see a doctor and you need to talk to a therapist. It's the only way you'll ever get rid of these negative emotions. And it's the only way you'll ever learn to control your anger.
"You need to talk to a therapist. That should help you.

Edit: I recommended a therapist because you need somebody to talk these thoughts out with. And it wouldn't hurt to talk to a doctor also."

"I am also diagnosed with schizophrenia and also take an antipsychotic (Invega Sustenna) and an antidepressant (Wellbutrin). I also have zero interest in sex or romantic attachment. It's a fairly new development for me, within the last year I'd say. I've chalked it up to the various antipsychotics I've been on - I think it was less pronounced on Abilify, more so on Geodon, but overall my sex drive and need for affection have taken a massive hit. "
"I have to talk to a therapist very soon (I hope) about constant and consistent fire-starting behaviors. That's pretty weird...and the mental health professionals around here have not dealt with many of these kinds of folks. This is going to be interesting that is for sure.

"If you're going to talk to a friend about self-harm, it needs to be somebody you really trust. The best option is to talk to a doctor or therapist. But if that's not a possibility, make sure you pick someone you're really close with.

Ive not met any of his relatives. I dont like his only friend. I find his friend actually disgusting (He was 21 and his girlfriend was 13 when they started to date so have completely distanced myself from him because apparently I caused problems calling him out as a paedophile and to just ignore him if I didnt like him.) I know his brother killed himself when my boyfriend was around 9 years old? Never met his other 3 sisters and brother though.
"Seconding the other comment. I remember reading about this in college. I think looking into the doctor listed in the other commenter's link, and talking to your own doctor, might be a good idea. 

It says the doctor in the article used other forms of therapy to prolong the positive effects of sleep deprivation without destroying the patient. I'd imagine that's really important, since sleep deprivation can only help in the short term.

Good luck!"
"This. I've been struggling real hard right now and losing weight is one thing I really want to do. After a lot of breakdowns and a super hard couple of months I'm just happy if I stay awake all day and shower. So I'll take that for now.

I'll burn out. "
"Those are great starts!
It's definitely not ""magical"" in any sense of the word. Exercise is just a basic part of life that many people have neglected. A lot of studies are linking mental health to lack of exercise and dehydration. Not to say fulfillment of those things is the one-step way to change.

"Yeah I suffer from social anxiety too. I was pretty shy as a kid so I never really learned social skills growing up. 

I know that crowds make you uncomfortable but the only way you'll ever overcome your social anxiety is by forcing yourself into social situations. I would also recommend going to group therapy. It'll force you to be around other people and it'll help improve your social skills. You just have to get out there and face it head on."
"Yeah, sorry, my replies are a little jumbled too. This is really great advice though. I kind of assumed meditation was to bring about feelings of contentment, but if you think it can help amplify positive emotion I might get into it more seriously. 

My first relationship has helped somewhat, but I think my family history let me get into a lopsided relationship where I wasn't treated the greatest. Maybe high volume casual flings will do better. "
"Yep, no appetite, and lots of zoning out, like if someone talks to me for too long or im doing something repetative i go into an almost blank state like ived been hypnotized.

"You may be addicted to work.  First, congratulations on finding and doing something you love.  Its not as common as you think. Second, if you are male which I assume you are, know that defining who you are by what you do is rather common.

That said, there is some risk psychologically with  the above.  You do need to somehow develop interests outside of work.  Work can be fleeting today, especially if your job depends on last quarter's earnings."
"Hi OP, this is actually very normal. Crying is therapeutic, and even people who are ""normies"" experience this, too. Not only does crying release endorphins, but it allows the release of emotions so they are no longer pent up - or at least AS pent up.

Mind you, I am no psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor by any means whatsoever, but I have been through enough of them, as well as groups, dealing with my own anxiety, depression, and trauma that I've learned a lot.

So if you're worried that this makes you weird, rest assured that this is part of how our bodies are designed to handle bad emotions. Even if it only helps for a little bit, it's actually a very healthy coping method, so embrace it!"

Don't feel badly, just own it, tell yourself that it is OK that you made a mistake and self-harmed (if you feel you should do this) and breathe. Can you use other techniques to calm yourself and distract yourself when you feel you have to s/h? I think that is what I ended up doing (I was forced to stop bc they were going to take my kids away) but I don't remember exactly how I had stopped self-harming. I know it was a hard thing to do. I am sending tons of hugs to you! Take it easy on yourself and I hope you can heal! &lt;3"
"Its because they're not trained like traditional service animals. You, not your doctor or psychiatrist, not the ADA, but you alone are responsible for how that animal behaves. You are liable if that animal acts out or hurts anyone, etc. This isn't just to single you or anyone else out with an ESA, this is just the fact of the matter. Its all about covering asses and making sure the wrong people aren't sued for any incidents.

I work in a medical office and while even we are the most understanding of having an ESA, our security will still ask for documentation or ask you to remove the animal from the premesis. Its unfortunate, but it's what it is. Most places are at their own discretion with this."
"Licensed mental health therapist and currently in grad school to be a psych DNP. 

Your friend is having a manic and/or psychotic episode, and from your story it doesn't seem like this is the first time. He sees to have several stressors in life, on top of years and years of untreated mental illness. These two factors exacerbate each other and make what would be manageable situation intolerable. Depending on what state you are in you can go to the court house and file for him to be probabted for observation and stabilization. I know it sounds awful to do that to someone you care about, but it protects you and most importantly gets him the help he needs to get back to the person you know and love."
"Oh dear. You sound SO much like myself. I just cut myself for no apparent reason besides I had a strong urge to do so. I have Impulse Control issues anyhow, but I am not feeling particularly sad either, yet I have ugly cuts on my arm now that I have to hide. I can't tell you why you did it, but at least you recognize that you did do this, on purpose. It is ok. Our minds are mysterious and sometimes we do stuff that we say WTF to later. I hope you feel better and the burn isn't too bad. I suffer from Pyromania, so I am constantly burning my damn fingers and hands (not to the point of scars but just minor stuff), and I can tell you...they hurt like a mofo. You can message me if you need to talk. :)"
"I don't have a bipolar diagnosis, no. I've actually never thought it might be the case until tonight. My diagnosis at the moment is clinical depression and generalised anxiety, but tonight I've been in a particularly turbulent state and I reflected on times in the past I've felt this way and wondered if it was perhaps a symptom of bipolar. Once my doctor is back I'm going to ask him if I can take a test to see if it's something I have. 

A couple of years ago, I wanna say late 2016 I was in a ""mixed affective state"" shall we say and heard my parents complaining about me in the other room. Talking about how I need to get a job and that I'm lazy and so on. Long story short I snapped, threw a glass and threatened to stab my father and then kill myself. To say this was out of character is an understatement. I couldn't explain why I was so highly strung at the time but maybe it was a mixed affective state like you've mentioned. Thanks for your input :)"
"I had a similar thing happen to me when I was in highschool. I struggled dating within my school so I started talking to a girl from one town over. I didnt know much about her other than she was sort of a loner like me. Few months later we started dating and I really did like this girl, cant say I loved her, but the potential was there. One night after a football game I got a text from a number asking if this was me. I said ""yes who is this?"". The number then sent me two pictures of my girlfriend getting double teamed by two dudes whom I didnt recognize. I will never forget that feeling of my stomach turning inside out. I had insomnia for weeks, my grades started to nose dive, and I wasnt even hanging out with my small group of friends anymore.  Anyway, that fucked me up to the point of not dating again until I was 21. The only thing that completely put that fire out was meeting the love of my life and getting married. I hope you feel better man. "
"A few years ago I had a terrible year -- lots of stress, was changing my meds, and I did a lot of dumb things I felt really bad about. I beat myself up over it for years. 

You already know that it's not constructive, and also know that that doesn't always help.

If the things you did harmed others, consider apologizing or making amends to them. 

Beyond that, your best way to move past it may be to stop trying to move past it. Sometimes the effort to forget about something keeps it even more in our minds.

When you feel yourself thinking about it and feeling embarrassed, you could try just accepting that feeling. Acknowledge in your mind that you did something you regret and feel bad about it. 

And then forgive yourself. Sometimes we can be our harshest critics. The incident I describe above, I did something terrible to someone who was a friend. That person forgave me years before I forgave myself.

You can't go back, only forward. If you've learned from the mistake, and made amends, that's all you can do. Your brain may keep reminding you of what you did, but if you repeatedly just accept the feeling and forgive yourself, over time it will soften and you will get some of the resolution you seek."
"You're not an idiot. You're under a lot of stress and, like you said elsewhere, in a difficult situation.

You're allowed to talk to her without knowing all the answers, without knowing what to do already. That's why she's there; to help you learn to carry your burdens in a manageable way and to see that maybe they're not as big as you thought they were.

Is there a way to talk to her without your mother present? Sometimes having family in the room makes everything harder to talk about.

You may not be fully in control of your compulsions at the moment, but it doesn't make you disgusting or stupid. Please try not to think like this about yourself--extreme self-loathing talk like this, even in jest, can someday become real if you repeat it too much. I fell into the trap of tumblr and twitter users calling themselves trash jokingly and after too long of doing it, I started believing it myself. Your words have power, especially the ones you use for yourself.

Baby steps, friend. You still went to your therapy appointment. You still mentioned things you're actually struggling with. You recognize that you could have said more. All of those are progress. And any progress is good progress right now. &lt;3"
"I'm in my early 20's now and when I was 13 and 14, things started getting really rough in school. I dealt with bullies and was a bit of an outcast, the odd one out, I never did fit in with the others and so I was very lonely. Whenever I tried making friends, things often didn't work out and the others would just leave me out of the group so I'd be alone again. I started feeling depressed and would self harm as well. My mom also didn't take it seriously at all until she saw my wrists where I had cut myself. She got angry with me and said she'd force me into a mental hospital, and I got scared so I promised her I'd never do it again, so she'd leave it alone. She did and I just kept self harming, but did it elsewhere so she wouldn't notice it. So I can relate to a lot of what you're writing. No one is being supportive or understanding and it's awful to read that you're already thinking about suicide when you're so young.

The truth is that school sucks for most people and it's a time most of us have to just get through because once we finish high school, things get better (for most of us)
It's better when we get older because then there are bigger chances of meeting people who are more mature since they're older. You might be more mature than the rest of the people you've met and therefore you don't get along with them, so when you meet someone on your maturity level, things will get better and you'll find some people you really like who like you as well and you should never have to pretend to be someone else to have someone like you. If you're yourself, things will happen naturally when it's time.

School sucks, but things get better when you get a little older. In the meantime, see if you can get your frustrations out in a healthier way than self harming. I use running now as a way to get my anger and depression out. Exercises either mentally or physically can help a lot with emotional pain. Meditate, write in a journal about your thoughts (it can actually help, as cliché as it sounds, but when your mind is going through chaotic times in your life, writing things down can help like therapy, like talking things out with someone), also actual therapy might be an option for you? When you go for a walk, run or dance or exercise in another way, your endorphins kick in so you feel better. It might not happen right away, the first time you exercise, but as you start doing it more and more, you will feel it. It's good for your body and soul to exercise - as annoying as that is at first. Dance classes can also help you find friends, often it helps people loosen up as they let their guards down because you can be quite self concious and full of doubt but when you dance, you have to let go a little bit and accept that you might look silly, but often people forget that and just have fun and smile and move to the music. So people often find friends during dance classes or other sports. Like soccer, tennis, badminton, basketball, kickboxing, whatever you might like? :)"

Do you think you could have done it without medication? Meds make me suicidal. I'm also looking into TMS therapy as I do exposure. Did exposure therapy help you eventually even though it sucked?
Even sat here I'm already drinking and tempted to double up on my dose or tale enough to feel what I felt when I first started taking them. I just want to dope myself out and not think anymore.
"I hope you are OK...I have obsessive and compulsive thoughts too and most times, I space out (while in the midst of them) and run into things when I'm walking and stuff. I can definitely relate."
I hope you come out of the sunken place before it’s too late for her man. When you lose her is when you’ll realize you’re making the wrong turns and that you didn’t do ALL that you can.
I think that people's negative attitudes are more a reflection of them than it is a reflection of what they are reacting to. It sounds like some defensiveness that they need probably to work on.
"I was on this med for a while. It caused lots of nausea and didn't really help bc I wasn't on it for long.

"Saving this for later cause I need to go to fucking bed and I’ve got a show in the morning, I will return! Assuming my adhd doesn’t kick in and I forget all about this. Stupid useless brain."
"Sounds like we have both gone too far down the rabbit hole!
That's a pretty cool outlook and at least gives you some options. Not like me sitting here typing away these predetermined words, lol."
"There's probably no point, I've nobody else can seem to help me how's one person going to help, they wouldn't understand the sheer depth of how I feel about things I don't think... nobody would."
Wait--isn't there a name for this? I can't think of it and I can't google it right now. I hope your friend finally does talk to someone. This must be so frightening. :( Good luck to both of you.
Yes!!!!! It's completely possible to get better. I am astounded every day but I am no longer depressed. Sometimes I go weeks without remembering what it used to be like... So yes. There is hope.
You can get a bottle of the sublingual type for like 10 bucks at Walmart if you have anemia like me the ones you actually swallow won't work. You have to get the ones you put under your tounge.

i often feel this same way, i’d say just not as intense as you are describing it. the truth is haven’t really figured it out yet, but that’s okay"
"I'm also diagnosed with PTSD, and have wondered if all of this is actually CPTSD. My last therapist hypothesized that I ""developed"" BPD after a traumatic experience at age 16; although, I've also often thought that my brain processes things that may not be traumatic to most people as traumatic for me (getting yelled at, recieving criticism, literally any type of embarrassment, etc.). I'm going to have to look more into CPTSD. Thanks for the info!"
"I'm doing my best, self care is kind of new for me. I'm a caregiver and peacekeeper kind of personality. I tend to loose myself in helping others. It's hard because he has a terrible support system. So, I'm getting the brunt of his pain. I'm doing my best to not take it personally, but how can you not when you hear constantly ""no one cares about me"" my heart breaks every time. I know it's his fear talking, because I've been there too many times. "
"I'm glad it went mostly well!! Let them believe what they want lol. As long as they love you, that's key. I recently told my mother I was panromantic/asexual, and she was very skeptical too. I think the older generations just don't fully understand sexuality like our generation and younger understands it.

That said, I'd still strongly recommend a therapist. It won't be a 100% guarantee, but it could definitely help stop a relapse from happening."
"Thank you for this post. As a senior in college, I feel like such a screw up for not having attended any parties, not having lost my virginity, or even having gone to a concert or gotten a manicure (that said, I was more or less a tomboy until half way through high school). Hell, I didn’t even go to any of my proms as a teen.

And oddly enough, I didn’t start worrying about these things until I moved into my suite a few weeks ago. Go figure. "
"Try to acknowledge that this is some sort of mental health problem and begin to forgive yourself. You might benefit from seeing a therapist. Just know that everyone has their flaws and that the people in your life probably see this and are fine with it.

You deserve a better chance at happiness. You’re not a bad person."

"My wife began attempting to contact his therapist to tell her about our concerns. After several months, they spoke about some things. Apparently his therapist wanted to talk to us too. She added more to the list of concerns, her voice would shake as she talked to us about him. She couldn't diagnose him with anything major, him being a minor at the time, but she said he experienced episodes of psychosis and lacked empathy. But she was able to diagnose him with PTSD from the emotional abuse from his parents. She said her biggest fear as far as people went were those who could do bad things to others without remorse. She also said she thought he had attempted to groom her a few times.

The first week was bad and the hunger got painful, but the disorder lied to me and told me I was fat, etc. etc. so I wouldn't eat. After a while, I stopped feeling hungry. I was also the purging subtype of Anorexia, so when I would eat, I would just purge it back up. I would rarely, if ever, binge. No matter how little I ate, I would purge it. I got down to a pretty unhealthy weight for my body type, and I looked horrible.  


It isn't easy going a long time without eating. Maybe your physiology is one that needs fuel more often (higher metabolism maybe?) so when you hadn't eaten, your body was just looking for that fuel and it wasn't there, causing you the symptoms you'd felt. I wish you luck and love. Eat more often and smaller meals/snacks if you have to. That is what I was taught when I went into recovery, which I am still in. :)"
"Wow man, your post spoke to me. I felt like I was reading my own thoughts.

Just replace drugs and alcohol with video games and microtransactions and I'm not married and you and I could be the same person. Anyways...

What I do/I suggest:

If you have any true, *true* friends that you can closely speak to, then talk your feelings to them. Sit down with them and vent your heart out. Let them know how you're feeling. Maybe you can grab some insight. If you don't, then I suppose you could talk to your wife? I mean, you're in it together for life now that you're married. You're a team now, so if you really feel like this will cause problems down the line, might as well try to sort out the lumps now, right?

When I start to have the thoughts of suicide or just terrible thoughts in general, I like to quickly stuff my mind full of good thoughts; my favorite food or such. I also look for stuff to look forward to, such as an in-game event.

I hope I helped."
"I have these same what I categorize as ups and downs or drastic mood changes. I would look into getting seen by a behavioral psychologist. Bipolar disorder runs in my family, so I contribute my swings to that, I dont take any meds for it. And it sounds like this could be a possibility. But if it helps, when I get in my down moods I will do one of two things, both work but only certain times I haven't been able to pinpoint yet. 1. Is when I feel down I isolate myself, which sounds bad, but I read or watch tv, or do a puzzle, listen to music, something to distract my mind from the thoughts running through it, not giving them my conscious mind. Or 2. I will sit with one other person, no more than two, and describe what I'm feeling, this only works if they know your problems, or you've talked to them about it before and then grasp what's happening, not everyone is going to know how you feel, but finding someone to listen makes a big difference. Anyway I tell them how I feel and then do something mindless with them. If your comfortable to try to go out and do something in the world then by all means do it, I prefer to just have someone there with me watching movies or something when I've talked to them. "
"It all started when I was born tbh. I have had paranoia and magical thinking since I was around the age of 8 or so, and actively hallucinated at age 12, but that went away. Psychosis didn’t become a major role in life up until a year ago, when I had my first psychotic break. It started with your simple dissociation, and then progressed into this one massive delusion that almost made me blow my brains out (literally), because I believed I was stuck in this rewinding cycle of purgatory / hell and the only way to escape it was killing myself. After that psychotic break, I dealt woth severe panic attacks up until December, when hallucinating became apart of my normal daily life. It started off as psuedo-hallucinations (walls moving, stuff coming out of my TV, etc...) and a girl’s voice every now and then. I got hospitalized for it in March, and the stress of that is what led to become my primary auditory hallucination, John. John’s been around for a few months, only recently has he gotten louder. I used to believe people were monitoring me, and still do despite medications. Tbh, I knew I had Schizophrenia but didn’t want to accept it, it was obvious if you added all the experiences up together. "
"This could be a reaction, so to speak, to the hormones, but I Think it is deeper than that. Since you had a horrible experience transitioning to Middle School, and  now to college, I think Anxiety may be a real possibility. Your mind is doing what my mind does. It speaks half-truths and outright lies. I have the same thing when I am going through one of my ""episodes"". It tells me to burn down a building (No thank you!!) or to burn down the woods near my house (almost did that, but got spooked and put it out) or even that I need to start another fire because I need it (I do need it but sometimes I can't because my family is around). I listen to music when these thoughts start up, and that helps to quiet them down a bit. You can also talk to someone about these things. They may recommend medication, but you don't have to go that way. You can ask if there is any other way first. The world of mental illness is indeed terrifying at times, and confusing, sad, lonely, and frustrating as hell. I have been mentally ill basically most of my life, but I try not to use that to define myself. I hope you can find peace and I hope you feel better. You can ask me any questions you like. My messages are always open."
"Being underage, I firstly confronted my parents about it and they took me to different psychologists over the years, but I never found any of them actually helpful (still to this day I've refused to go to a psychologist, but that's because I'm working on my own self and for now it's going pretty well). As I got more and more severe they took me to an equipe of psychiatrists and they quickly diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, even though it's not accurate. They said that my condition might lead to a bipolar disorder, but because I'm so young and presenting different kinds of symptoms ,other than investigating on that they decided to prescribe me Seroquel, which works for both depression and bipolar disorder. I don't know how the health care system works in your country, but here in Italy it is free and the biggest concern on mentally ill people is just to convince them to get help, because once you do you'll only have to spend little money on tickets for visits (and still, if you can't afford it then it's free).
There are many ways to reach out for help, depending on your age (if you are underage then your parents will most likely have to be involved) and economical condition (if you live in a country where the health care system is not free and you can't afford medical care, I'm sure there must be some free programs for you to take part in). I hope i have been in anyway helpful, for any further question you can ask me and I'll be glad to help!"
"There’s depression and depression. Sounds as though your experience was the former. 

I think you mean well, but, for those of us with depression that is extensive and treatment resistant, the way it seems that you’re approaching it is a bit infuriating. 

I want help. Do I do everything that people suggest? Nope. 

Typically, I don’t do what people suggest because I’ve already done it and it didn’t work. It’s been a common enough experience for me that people who make the suggestions take that as me refusing help or choosing to remain depressed when they’re holding out what they consider to be a reasonable option. Even those who are very well intentioned. And, I let them continue to think those things because it takes too much out of me to try to explain things and they usually end up holding onto their low opinion of me anyway.

I can’t tell you how many times people have told me that I just need to exercise or change my diet or get a job or whatever. I’ve done all of those things, and so very much more. 

And, I still have major depression. 

I’ve worked as I’ve been able, but my resume has big gaps. This current major episode (I say major episode because I have NEVER experienced remission from depression) has been three years. Three years of mostly being in bed. At first, I was able to get out a bit more. I walked almost every day, sometimes up to 10 or more miles, went to the nearby state park and hung out, worked on some projects, kept up with the dishes, etc. But, my condition continues to erode. I’ve been in talk therapy, have taken every pill they throw at me, and have gotten even more aggressive with my treatment with things like electroconvulsive therapy. 

And, I still have major depression. 

Right now, a really good day for me is when I put on pants and walk my dog around the neighborhood for twenty minutes. If it’s an even better day, I actually load the dishwasher or do laundry, but I probably can’t do both. "
As someone who has been sober for three years I often think about this. It amazes me that alcohol is so accessible when it is so destructive and people are fighting so hard to keep weed illegal.
"Fantastic advice, thanks!  I'd love to keep in touch about how it goes, but I don't want to promise anything, because I have a severe memory problem, and it's really hard for me to be organized. "
"Have you ever participated on ""group therapy"" or participate on other group activities that you like even online like this will help.

If you need need someone to talk to feel free to message me."
"I have anxiety, im on medication for it, but I’ve never experienced anything thats this intense for this long. I did call my Psych and he said to call mental health hotline if I get any worse. "
"I would try a hobby. I am going to start painting soon, when i can afford to buy paints. I use to play video games, lost interest. Working on cars is always nice. Just try to keep yourself busy. "
"I'm sorry to hear you feeling that way. I've had those moments as well, so I partly know how you're feeling. I'm sending you a virtual hug! &lt;3

I'm here for you if you need someone to talk to."
"If you still have the leaflets I believe it usually says on there what to do in case of a missed dose. Failing that you can find leaflets for most medication online, so try a quick Google search."
Its an online platform think of like a mobile app and matches are based on a software algorithm so a physical human doesn't even see your data. The  software matches you based on your preference.
"Same -- I always feel more ""down"" when Holidays are close. Me and a friend used to call it the ""Holiday Blues."". It may be linked to Seasonal Depression (which, surprisingly, is a real disorder)."
"Shower, wash your hair, brush your teeth, and wear clean clothes every day. It’s not exactly the most important thing, but the simplest thing to make me feel human when I’m having a bad time."
"Smol bear hug from me too! ���� 

Imo, hugs are some of the best things that has ever been created. It helps me express my feelings that I couldn't do in words. Best wishes to you! ��"
"There is literally no way of knowing from so little. No stranger online can help you figure this out, you need to see a professional over a good course of time to really know anything. Good luck."
"Welcome to the life of an introvert! Enjoy your stay ��


Kidding.. sort of. But I’m highly introverted and this is something I do almost daily (well, minus the actual out loud arguments). "
"Yeah I went under his profile and looked at some of his other parts before he deleted it. I don't know if he's a mental health hypochondriac or a troll, but either way he seems like a lost cause."
Yeah I’m going to make an appointment to see a therapist on Monday to figure what I need to do. I have changed because of this and I’m worried if I continue without help I will only get worse
"You have to let it go and move on. If you want help, but don't feel ready for another therapist, maybe try and find a local therapeutic group. Peer support can be just as effective as 1:1 therapy"
"Most of my conversations aren't better than Scrabble games. Nothing connects, and I'm denied personal connections. People dance around and make small talk so small it hurts. I've never made contact with another person. I struggle to maintain my own mind space. I have frequent and devastating amnesia, and computer or ethereal viruses remove physical reminders and records. I have nowhere to go because I'm targeted, and it's a long fall if I slip up."
"So you would prefer a mental health professional to only focus on the good in you (the functioning part that doesn’t need fixing) rather than attempt to help you with whatever problem is? How the heck is that even helpful to you?

Dude everyone has flaws. People who just kiss your ass aren’t friends. Sometimes it takes someone calling out your bullshit to realize toxic behavior. Call me an enemy then because bad traits make for shitty people. "
Thank you for your suggestions. Was diagnosed bipolar a little over a year ago. Had a pretty substantial breakdown that lasted for months previously. Not doing awesome but am improving with growing insight. I am grateful that there are others like you brave enough if only to try and offer what help they themselves have had to find. I look forward to being able to reach a hand out to sufferers after I've earned some healing.   That's it. Thank you.
"Whatever you do, don't blame yourself. There's absolutely nothing you can do about it. If you don't have the same feelings for him, then that's not your fault. Don't force yourself into a relationship with him just because you think he might commit suicide. He needs to understand that suicide isn't the answer. He'll eventually get over the rejection. And he needs to know that. It might hurt for awhile but he will move on. Suicide is not necessary."
"Hmmmmm..... Now that could be drugs. If so that doesn't explain his hitting or yelling. They could be 2 separate data points. On the other hand, all of this together could point to some kind of psychotic break. Could be all 3. I'm both concerned and intrigued. Whatever the case Its highly possible that R may hurt himself or someone else in this state. He's already shown signs of delusion as well as violent impulses. I don't see it as too much of a stretch to think that violence could come out again and/or turn inward. I suggest your friend L sees a professional to help her cope as well as to seek advice on what to do, if anything, about R. If you see him again and he's acting strangly, be careful. "
"I just wanted to make you aware that at 14, you cannot be diagnosed with a personality disorder because your personality is still developing. I’m not saying that you can’t be bothered by the things you feel, that you don’t need help, or that you don’t have any mental health concerns. I’m just saying don’t get ahead of yourself. A humongous number of teenagers would technically meet criteria for borderline PD specifically, and that’s why it’s not diagnosed before age 18. 

I would recommend that you talk to your parents and see if they are willing to send you to a therapist. If not, perhaps there is a school counselor (they go through the same education programs) you could meet with?"
"I read it. I find the comment highly disgusting, reading it again won't make me like it. You really invalidate everything else with this sentence.  

&gt; I believe if he truly wanted to die, he would’ve done it earlier since we gain full conscious of actions by age 12.  

Maybe you just have not experienced a lot of people close to you killing themselves. Or hurting so bad they tried to. But I can simply not find any excuse in my mind to say such a thing. Suicidal feelings are very delicate and personal. Your statement is só bold, and quite frankly, rude and offensive. But I am not feeling like getting into an argument with you. I am not mad at you, just very surprised by your choice of words. "
"If you want to go down the honest route, have a word with your manager and let them know that you’re happy to greet every customer that comes in store but it is impossible to have multiple conversations going, whilst you’re completing tasks.

Otherwise, if I was you, I would put on an act when they’re around but not engage in conversation with customers and do what has to be done. Just play dumb if you get pulled up on it and beat them at their own game.

I know what it’s like to feel under pressure because you care so much, but take a deep breath and don’t stress yourself too much over it. Do the bare minimum to keep them satisfied and look for something else on the sideline, if you can."
"The day that I was diagnosed I called my ex (who has asma) and yelled at him. I was so frustrated that takes so long to be diagnosed, that there's no blood test that can show it, that people don't understand and that every medication is a shot in the dark. I just arrived from my friends place and her mom said for me to read and shop instead of going to therapy. When my friend explained better, she kind of apologize and told me she didn't know because she never felt like that. 
I'm lucky that I have friends who are supportive, but I wondering how long they'll last if I can't get up this time. My boyfriend can't handle me anymore, so he's moving out. Hopefully we'll be able to save the relationship. "
"i know a guy i used to talk to quite a bit who is the same way. said he just did what his dad did in terms of career and slaving away for a better future for his family. except his kids are now slaving away and it's become this vicious cycle.

 he always talked trash about his wife, which i get was not always genuinely how he felt, but it sounded like they barely got to spend time together b/c of work and also had quite different desires and personalities. 

he is of course medicated and told me recently he was/is a functioning alcoholic on top of that. 

i think it's a common enough situation for a lot of people. the wife seems depressed too and they just had their second kid. american dream, eh. "
"this is disappointing. I was hoping you'd understand the rules and regulations of ethics and conduct set by boards and the APA. If you did you'd know that professional recommendations are totally fine, haha. I suppose you should avoid this subreddit, since therapists are spewing out random advice all over the place regarding diagnoses, treatment, and professional recomemndations. I suppose you're especially heated at mine because you're justifying something within yourself.

I'm not going to waste my time and explain to you the professional boundaries that are set in our field. It's disheartening that you don't already know them as a professional, but I guess not everyone passes their ethics class."
"Hey!

From my personal experience I've been dealing with anxiety/depression for a very long long time and my current bf is learning on how to support me and deal with my breakdowns, which is very difficult. My best advice for you from the other side is, go with her to therapy or go yourself to get informed on how to deal with that. 

It's a very difficult path to get through, because you need to understand that when it comes to anxiety, we do not comprehend midpoints, i mean, it's all or nothing, we tend to think the worse in every situation. Situations that at your eyes might appear as something silly and simple but to us is the end of the world. It takes patience to deal with a mentally ill person, I can tell you that. 

You gotta let her know that you are on this with her and always remember her how beautiful and graceful she is, always tell her how much you love her and encourage her to get better. We tend to feel abandoned by the world when the reality is far from what we are thinking.

Give her some space sometimes and also encourage her to do things that she enjoys, if you can join her, even better!  

If you need any kind of advise, feel free to send me a message. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck OP"
"My first therapist after a few sessions told me I didn’t need therapy anymore so that was a flop. I was in grade 9 at the time and didn’t feel the authority to say I felt I still needed it. Was covered under insurance. 


My second therapist was awesome, helped me feel refreshed and hopeful after every session, called me out when I needed it, changed the way she counselled to fit my personality. But ultimately felt like it was just a band aid over the problems but not improving anything. Although I admit the problems I was having didn’t give much room for her to actually improve anything so it was doomed (shitty relationship took up most of the spotlight when I wanted to go to her for anxiety and depression) so I think it would’ve been better if I wasn’t so distracted. Only reason I stopped going to her was I moved away from that city. Also it was $130/hour uncovered. 

The third therapist has to have been the best fit. I have had so many revelations with her and overall feel like I have a different mindset after sessions with her. I feel hopeful and less worried after sessions and also see tangible improvements. My life has really changed. Unfortunately she moved away to get her PhD but thankfully is doing Skype sessions. She is charging about $80/hr uncovered but its sliding scale so I could be paying less if I was struggling but honestly after paying $130 this is nothing and she deserves it. It allows me to have more sessions in a month. "
"Hi. I'm a Narcissist and I can tell you first hand if you have to question whether you are one or not, you don't fully understand the definition. If you were one...You would know it, and for the most part, you wouldn't care...like myself. Narcissists are made, not born, so take a look at your life and think about what made you change your stance at looking at yourself in the mirror. Why did you hate it before? Why do you enjoy it now? Is it because people called you names, made fun of you, or you simply didn't get the attention from the people you were attracted to? If any of those reasons are the case, maybe over time you built up a protective shield within your mind to block out all attempts from others to get to you. Maybe you convinced yourself you are better looking than you really are, and your worth is much more valuable than what society gives back. In other words, you may in fact be average as hell in personality, and looks, but to ensure no one can hurt your feelings, you overcompensated your overall value. Which is not always bad. We ALL must do what we must to live our lives happy within ourselves, which unfortunately may hurt others in the process.  

 In my opinion, Narcissists CAN have empathy...but there is a limit to how much, and with who it's directed towards. I know for a fact i'm a Narc and I do care about others to a degree...but at the end of the day, I can also stop caring anytime I want...as easy as a light switch. It's a protective measure I learned from childhood to get me through my rough years. check out my video on this for further details.

"First of all, there are a lot of different pathologies when it comes to people

There are sadists that enjoy hurting others, and they will often hurt and kill animals for their own pleasure. Someone will never target other humans, but most will find a way to inflict emotional or physical pain on someone that they have power over . . . maybe a child or a submissive girlfriend or just someone weaker than themselves.

On the other hand, there are psychopaths who simply lack empathy towards other human beings. They are not crazy or ""psycho"" as you put it, but they simply will not care or choose not to be aware of how their actions will hurt others. Some people say that psychopaths are particularly affectionate towards animals and young children. 

Is your friend a sadist? I don't think so. He loves animals, and he would be hurt at the idea of causing pain to an animal, while a sadist would derive pleasure from hurting an animal. That is my understanding of sadism, someone please correct me if I'm wrong. 

Is he a psychopath? Well, my understanding is psychopathy is that it is a spectrum. There are individuals who will display a great deal of empathy towards some people and a remarkable lack of empathy towards others. I believe the idea of a ""pure psychopath"" with absolutely zero empathy is a myth. 

That being said, your friend seems not to empathize with strangers that he doesn't know. He is ""normal"" or friendly towards people he understands like his friends.

You said that he has been abused. Well, you're powerless when you're a kid being abused by a parent or a teacher or someone in a position of power over you. A lot of people feel the need to ""reclaim"" their power in a few different ways in their adulthood. It seems like your friend feels powerful when he makes other people afraid of him. He threatens them with violence, like he did with that salesman, and it makes him feel good about himself, he feels like he is in control. 

Is your friend going to kill someone? I highly doubt it. 

Is he going to continue to threaten people? Absolutely. 

Will he fight someone and maybe hurt them seriously? It is very possible.

Will he get arrested and suffer the consequences of his violent behavior? Absolutely . . . one way or another, whether he really hurts someone or simply continues to threaten people . . . he's going to get in trouble. Even if he avoids trouble with law enforcement, he might simply try to threaten someone who fights back with a knife. 

Should you report him to the police? I think you should notify the police if he makes a very specific threat against someone. Like if he says ""I'm going to stab Mr. Russell with a kitchen knife when he leaves his house tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM"" . . . then definitely report him to the police. If he says ""I hate people so much, I'm going to murder them all"" . . . well, that's just him being an asshole. It might help if you tell him that he should go to therapy, although it is unlikely that he takes your advice. "
"&lt;3 thanks. I need to shower and relax...I need to do my thing again, but I can't right now. I have to put it off. Struggle struggle. If you need to talk, just PM me. I will be back later on. :)"
"Btw it may also help a bit if you say aloud to yourself ""my mind has a mind of its own and doesnt follow any logic or reasoning"" That way you can try to separate your mind's thoughts from reality "
But do you think the depression can be there all the time and you never feel in love? Especially if you've never been in a relationship before? How is someone supposed to know if it's love or not?
"Electric shock has been used to treat mental disorders from the very beginning.  It has been met with mixed success.  If that weren't true, we'd all be sticking our peckers into the light sockets."
He probably feels/felt similar to you and now is extremely happy and proud to have a girl and talks about it in pride or amazement as opposed to trying to rub it in. I would assume you’re young.
I absolutely love mine! I have anxiety and ptsd and it has helped a bunch during panic attacks or times when my anxiety gets too bad. I sleep with it almost every night and it helps me feel safe .
"I agree.  Its like being ""a team"".  If the only name at the top of your Performance Review is yours, you can call yourself ""a team"" or a flock of seagulls or a can of peas for all that it matters."
I don't have any friends either. And the one's in my past only took advantage of me. Just know that you're not a burden to me. Don't be afraid to send me a message if you need somebody to talk to.
I don’t know what to say but just try and get away from him if he’s making you feel really bad and just stay close to the people that make you happy the most. I hope you can get through it! :)
"I hope you're doing well too and are looking after yourself. I don't think it's managed just yet, I'm constantly in and out of hospital for psychosis but I hope to have it managed sometime soon.  "

Good luck :)"
I used and had a good experience with Talkspace. However I feel it’s gotten a bit pricey.  Betterhelp I think is a bit cheaper. I wonder if you could do Skype sessions with a Canadian therapist?

"If you focus on being happier by putting your friends needs ahead of your own (within reason), you will experience what it means to be a loving person. 
Be ready to let go of a few friends though."
"Just because it's a symptom he has doesn't mean he ""can't help it."" It means he needs to do more to avoid those behaviors than the general population would, not that he can't stop those behaviors."

Part of being a good friend is recognizing unhealthy behavior and steering them to activities they can participate in. Its about understanding if they bail or are having a particularly rough day.
"Pot. Seriously. That and if they don't like me, it doesn't matter. I'm not going to change their mind. Just being rad is fun enough that worrying about the other stuff just seems a waste of time. "
Risperdone and anti-depressants helped me with that. I no longer take anti-depressants (though I'm thinking about taking them again) Risperdone helps control racing thoughts and I still take that.
"Something similar happens to me too. Whenever there is a sound that slowly gets louder, especially a tone, I will freak out and have a panic attack. I think its’s some sort of sensory overload. "
"Sorry about that. In my native language, the translation for ""girl"" can be used for older females as well (at least up to about 30 years old). Didn't know it was so strict in the English language."
Suicide is less selfish than we think. Imagine the pain she must have been in to decide to hurt everyone she knew. How much does it have to hurt for you to hurt everyone else just to feel relief?
Thank you! I'm really glad you dig it. I'm kind of posting this without her knowing because she has no idea how awesome she is. Please share with anyone you think might get something out of it. :)
That’s definitely how I feel! I can ease into my day and start off on the right foot. On days that I don’t have my “me” time I notice a HUGE difference in my outlook on the rest of the day
The society and its norms make me feel this way. I behave differently. I act differently. I remember writing about it in my journal. Now I feel happy that I am not the only one who feels this way.
You're not alone in your feelings friend. Many people find their feelings difficult to understand and that's okay. You should see a professionals about how you're feeling. Things will get better.
"as i said, if she’s dangerously skinny or suffering from physical problems then she should get medical help, i’m not brushing off anything. if she is fine then there’s no need to intervene. "
"i know how you feel about having a very little bit of things to live for. and that your parents dont oay attention. but you gotta stay alive. i know how hard living with anxiety is, it's so hard. "
sounds like schizophrenia and narcissistic personality disorder. But you admit that you have a problem. a person with a narcissistic personality disorder wouldn’t admit that they have a problem.
"I am a girl but no birth control as it wrecks havoc with my body. My kids are 10, 3 and 5 months. 
I’ve also been through heaps of combos and mixtures of medication and it helps for a bit  and then back to a sad, hopeless person. 
I’m also so exhausted and tired. My husband gets up for the baby so it’s not that. 
I’m also occasionally taking zopiclone for sleep but I feel I shouldn’t be this tired. 
I truely feel like I can’t be helped."
"I would suggest calling, not emailing. You get a better sense of they sound nice, overwhelmed, gentle, a good fit for you, etc. Ask about their availability, their experience with your diagnosis. If you're looking for a specific type of therapy (CBT, DBT, Psychodynamic, Trauma Therapy, etc.), ask for their experience with that. Ask if they tend to focus more on the past or present. And if they tend to see their clients for more long or short term. "
"It took me ages to find meds that helped my anxiety and depression. I still get anxious, I still find life difficult to deal with, I still get sad and feel empty all the time. The only thing medication does for me is alleviate the dark pressure I feel on my chest all the time, it doesn’t take it away or make me happy. I wish it did to be totally honest but in my experience, it just makes life a little easier to deal with, not make you fake happy."
"Nobody will get mad at you here, and if they do, block their stupid insensitive ass. You don't need negativity now. I am also on Social Security Disability because my mental illnesses keeps me from working. I have a whole LIST of things wrong with me. I had been going to a psychologist at one time a long while ago, and he told me I also have PTSD from a traumatic childhood. You aren't alone. You're in good company. I am here to talk if you need to!"
"Not sure if I know what it is, but when my brain feels like it is too clogged, I try to journal and it almost always makes me feel better. I write about everything that is on my mind. If it is negative, I try to write about how it may help me in the end. 

It seems that when this is done, your brain no longer has to ruminate and feel the need to keep going over the same thoughts in an attempt to remember them. Just a thought. Might be worth a try. "
"There is always hope. Just look into the face of that wonderful being you had helped to create. :) He/she loves you! I am sorry about not being able to find a job. It is tough everywhere, isn't it? Our unemployment rate in my state is abysmal and even worse in the area I live in. Hang in there. Don't get too down on yourself. You are making an effort, and that is a lot more than I can say about a lot of people. I hope you find something soon! &lt;3"
"This reminds me of the time I thought my regular face looked ugly because I had been using SNOW. I only realized how much the app skews my face (making my skin clear, brightening my skin, widening my eyes, and giving me a more prominent jawline) when I was looking through my photo album. I would get upset when I saw my real face on reflections for a while, but thankfully I came to getting used to my regular face again after I stopped using the app."
Ugh. The worst part of is the 'forced smile' I can say I’m okay with a flat tone and no expression easily. But I feel obligated to look like I’m this super friendly and catering person since I’m at work. I used to be a hostess and during bad depression days it was the worst. Customers would walk in left and right and I’d be like hello how are you:)))))) and pretend to be all happy when I actually was thinking about dying the entire time. HA
"Well, then I am too.  
Diagnosed: Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and now Pyromania

History Of: Anorexia, Self-Harm (still doing this), Alcoholism, Asperger's  


Yep. I am messed up. I don't know what happened to me earlier but I lost time again. I remember lighting a small fire in my special metal box...then the next thing I remember I was being called down for supper? What the FUDGE happened to me?  


Glad to meet you."
"Well, we met in 1992 and right then, I knew he was the one. I feel such a deep connection to him that I can't even describe it. We got married in 1994 and our marriage has gone through everything imaginable: financial hardship (we lost our first home to foreclosure in fact), cheating, drinking (no drugs though), and especially my mental health issues. We have had fights, almost-breakups, make-ups and lots of years together. He is just my soulmate. "
"&gt; **I've always thought I could have borderline personality disorder, but the unstable relationship part of it doesn't fit.**

As with bipolar disorder, emotional instability is a hallmark of BPD.  Whereas the mood flips tend to come on slowly with bipolar, BPD mood flips typically occur in 10 seconds because they are triggered by a sudden event (e.g., action or comment) that poses a perceived threat to the abandonment fear or the engulfment fear.

If you would like a good book on BPD to read, I would suggest *Borderline Personality Disorder Demystified: An Essential Guide for Understanding and Living with BPD.*  As the other respondents pointed out, it is common for BPD and bipolar to co-occur.
"
"Beautiful description of a terrifying experience. I was about 10 years old when I suddenly found myself sitting awake on my bed, Mom and Dad next to me trying to calm me down. I had had a nightmare, and couldn't quite shake it off yet. And I was still yelling ""wood and water"" over and over. Even though I was already awake, I would focus on the closet doors of my room and could still see them swelling infinitely. Everything was swelling around me, as had happened in my dream. Everything was overboarding itself due to its mere material existence. Over the years I can still remember the sensation, and sometimes think of it as an experience of unconventional dimensions of reality. Thank you for sharing."
"I'm a very callous person, in a lot of areas. I've been surrounded by friends and family members dying so I have no fear of death, and there's few people I'd care if they died.

I didn't use anyone as motivation to give it one more try, yes, I made a promise to someone. It's very hard to explain; I'm not still doing this because I have some massive desire to keep living and ""see what the future holds"". I'm just doing it, may work out, may not, it's just something to do. Committing suicide is something to do, continuing to live is something to do.

You may not connect easily with people, but I'm sure there's someone out there you can connect with. No one's a true loner- I used to think that way too. "
"Kinda have done. Was socially isolated and unpopular as a child; over the years I practised telling stories, watching body language, trying to have balanced conversations, being willing to embarrass myself on occasion (like, going dancing, making dumb jokes and that sort of thing), to the point where in most situations I probably seem more socially adept and outgoing than most people.

On the other hand... it takes a lot of mental energy to do this and I still feel like most of the substance of my ""real"" thoughts and feelings is sort of trapped under the surface, very difficult to express in the context of words/conversation in real time, so I end up avoiding it sometimes. I don't know the solution."
"First of all, your gf shouldn't be pressuring you into sex. That's absolutely unacceptable, and I'm so sorry it's happening. Sex without consent is rape, and you don't need violence for that, emotional coercion can be enough. Does she eventually accept your 'no', or does she continue until you give in?

Second, it sucks that your collegues are shitty to you. They shouldn't be doing that, and you deserve to be treated humanely. I'd ask about HR but I know how minimum wage jobs are. People can be awful.

Third, check out /r/keto and /r/frugalketo. It helped me with my anxiety a lot, and it can save you money. If you want to lose weight that's an easy way to do it, and if you want to keep weight _on_ it's a good way to maintain. Just mind your electrolytes.

Fourth, it's awesome that you're getting therapy. I hope it helps, and I hope you'll be able to change some of those big negatives in your life. It's hard. But it can get better.

It can get better."
"I agree. I'm just giving her the benefit of the doubt because in writing it sounds awful but you know how family members will be like ""oh don't be silly don't say that"" thinking it is a joke. Personally in my family we would never use such harsh words. But thinking about my ex-husband's family they called each other names like it meant nothing. They didn't take it seriously. I was appalled every time I heard them refer to themselves as retards, but for some reason nobody's feelings were hurt, it was normal to them (not saying it's nice or justified). Just sort of imagining if it was that kind of interaction type where they're all obnoxious and the mom sort of ""told her off"" for mentioning suicide. 
Again I'm not justifying any of this but you know some families aren't politically correct at all, doesn't mean they're abusive. We don't know the whole story. She might be feeling like shit now and she really didn't mean it like that, but I'll never know."

"&gt; the best predictor of positive outcome in therapy is the strength of the therapeutic alliance and not the type of therapy being offered  

This is exactly the point. But you know, I do not like those ""therapeutic"" terms, because I go to those places to get help, and I do not care whether those helps are ""therapeutic"" or whatnot. I have met very few therapists who act like allies as you mentioned. It is to my own experience for sure, that quite a number of them perform acts of antagonism towards you. I probably mentioned this already, but I have noticed that they cast a bright light or bright colors on the environment and its specific people mentioned in the sessions, and not only dark stain on the client, but they also sometimes seem to *create* dark stains on the client. I'll give you a profound example:

I told my therapist about relationship positives I had some time ago. Then they asked me ""What are the problems though?"". I pretty much lost them there. By that time I was looking forward to advancing the relationship I had by then. And them choosing to say ""Hold it! There's **probably** something wrong with you"", turns the therapy process into some depressing recreational ritual.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Don't fight to get out. Sometimes we just can't... then you'll feel guilty over not being able to overcome everything (which is impossible because you are justified in your feelings - you've been through a lot - of course it would be near impossible to get out of it all alone so don't put pressure on yourself). 

Don't let yourself fall as well... Just hold on. Find help. Live moment-by-moment. Organize your thoughts and feelings. Take time for yourself, to disconnect. Find distractions and loads of stupid TV shows (or whatever shuts your mind off a bit everyday). 

You should be very proud that you've made it this far. You should be proud you are sensitive, wise and most of all... still wanting to fight it. Look around. How many people have given up with less than half the shit you've been through? Everyone's pain is relative but it helps in perspective to take some fucking pride in yourself! Your pains and struggles are personal yet long and exhausting. 

You seem to be able to think very clearly and logically about your experiences and you have an amazing and bright insight. You are noticeably strong as well. Very strong.

You will find the right help - you are halfway there. You are very conscious about everything, you're doing it right.

Keep fighting but take some time to disconnect and shut your mind off. Keep fighting but don't force yourself too much. You are weakened but your true self (the inner you) is much stronger. Take care of yourself. "
"I'm sorry to hear you had to go through that.  I hope your son does get something out of his time at the hospital but he will really need ongoing care.  

If he seems apprehensive or resistant to go going to therapy, I'll tell you the same thing I tell most parents of children they want in therapy or people with spouses they want in therapy but are resistant.  Go to therapy yourself, for yourself.  Find a therapist you can relate to and feel comfortable with to help you sort out some of your own stuff.  Talk about it openly with your family.  Let your son see that not only is it okay to go to therapy but that it can be really helpful.  

Leading by example or modeling is by far the best thing that you can do to encourage someone you love to really give therapy a chance.  Aside from the fact that it would probably help you a lot if you can find a therapist you connect with, it works like great reverse psychology.  If you tell him ""you need to do this"" he'll likely rebel.  If you show him ""Hey look!  I have this awesome thing that I'm doing.  I really like it and have found it helpful"" there's a good chance he'll want that too.


Think little kids and vegetables.  Try to force them to eat them and they'll fight you tooth and nail.  Show them that you love vegetables (whether it's true or not) and they'll want what you're having.  


I hope this helps.  Best of luck to you and your family.  Stay strong!

Just keep taking your meds and it should go away soon hopefully "
By putting yourself first and realizing that you are the one in charge of your own happiness. The only person who can truly make you happy is yourself. Cut off toxic people and remember that you're beautiful just the way you are. Have a sense of self-respect and don't waste your time on people who bring you down or hurt you. Don't be a doormat and learn to put your foot down when you need too. You need to value yourself before people will value you.

Dependimg on thebtime zone of you and your therapist you still may be able to get that, but be clear and honest in your needs."
I actually went ahead and told my parents everything. I think they tried very hard to let me know they still love me but STILL they refuse to belive that I'm gay and that it's something I can fix.

Thanks. Knowing that you were in a similar situation and able to work now and doing better is encouraging for me. I don't know if I can believe in myself . I have not felt good about anything yet.  Vocational rehabilitation is something I've never looked into. I will definitely check it out.  I realize my grandparents care about me to.. I just am more upset with myself then anything in the end I guess.    Thanks again. I've calmed down a little now.
"The environment we are in makes us depressed. There are surveys by psychologists of pre-modern societies and their depression rates are far lower. The Amish have like a tenth the depression rate of the average American and depression among Chinese people in the 90s was like 20 times that of in the 50s.


This isn't explained by increased access to mental health diagnosis, because these were based on survey questions asked to the population surveyed."
"First, I am so sorry to hear how empty you are feeling. You're not alone &amp; people do care. 

It's good to hear that you are seeing a psychiatrist and I hope there is a therapist involved too? Worth your time to meet with someone.

Families aren't trained necessarily to handle this, but they DO love you, so give them and others in your life a chance to learn how to help. They may make some mistakes - and they certainly will be rightly concerned - so hang in there with them. Talk to them and let them know how you feel. Right away.

And in the meantime, I would HIGHLY suggest texting 741-741 to the folks at Suicide Prevention. They are trained and can lend an ear any time night or day.

"In short you can feel a lot worse because antidepressants is a rather clumsy tool to fix depression and anxiety. The neurotransmitters they effect are sensitive to disturbances and normally the body regulate them alone. When you suffer from anxiety or depression this system is faulty so you add an antidepressant. It takes some time for the body to adjust, hence it taking a while until you feel the effect, when you quit it's the same, it takes time for your body to adjust. 

These neurotransmitters also don't only affect your mood but a lot of things in the body, which is why you can get all sorts of side effects. Also, everyone's chemistry is a little different, which is why people react differently."
"It sounds like depression man. If your doctor wont listen either get a new doctor, or play it up a little. See if you can get a referral to a psychiatrist or therapist. Most big hospitals have a mental health unit, and you can even call them directly for an appointment. Though feeling lonely could be just about anything, it does sound like depression, especially if it's bothering you.  


I've dealt quite a bit of this myself, though I think we're very different, feel free to PM me or ask me anything here. I'm 23, and I was depressed from as long as I can remember, to until around two years ago. It gets better one way or another, whether it be your situation its self, or your ability to cope with it."
"Same. I find comfort here, even though I am an oddball. There are not many others with the problem I have (I start fires compulsively and constantly)...but I also have Depression and Anxiety. The Depression isn't too bad right now, and my Anxiety comes and goes (and triggers my fire-setting behaviors) but I still enjoy helping people through their hard times. It makes me feel good because I have been there. I have tried to commit suicide countless times in my life, and I know that feeling of total hopelessness. If I can cheer someone up, I am happy. If I can comfort someone who is needing a hug, then that is awesome.  If I can make someone laugh. GREAT! 

:) It also distracts me from my own problems."
"A lot of intelligent people have undiagnosed ADHD since it tends to compensate.

\&gt; gifted

Note: IQ fluctuates a lot over your lifetime. You'll find nobody gives a shit and it doesn't give you much of an advantage and you will find yourself dumber than a brick at some point later in life. The important thing is in college/university/workforce you train a work ethic, communication skills, and how to get along with coworkers/classmates. Those three will get you further in life than being happy about an old IQ test result. There's two kinds of lazy: Smart lazy and dumb lazy. ADHD will make you dumb lazy. You want to train yourself to be smart lazy. Get shit done early, get shit done often, so you have free time later.

\&gt; ADHD  
Not a gift, nothing to do with being gifted, absolutely a curse with no upsides. Research, get diagnosed, get medicated. ADHD can and will destroy your life by preventing you from ever properly forming one in your 20's.

"I used to have the same problem. I had a battery of psychological testing and spilled the beans about it. In their final report they mentioned it and said it wasn't abnormal.

So. Looks like it happens sometimes.

I also didn't want to be around knives. It'd always trigger a vision. Oh, and godforbid, DO NOT watch that X-Files episode &lt;shudders&gt;

When I'd have one of those visions, I'd stop what I was doing and recenter myself, then try again. If I had the vision again, I'd walk away.

Over time the visions stopped. I don't know if they were related to anything. I know the visions to swerve off the road was related to feeling suicidal, but the knife problem wasn't. Maybe anxiety? Stress? See if you can find a pattern.

I've been on medication for a number of years. I'm not sure if that was also a factor in getting the visions to stop.

But, I think working overall to improve your mental health may just help relieve them. It certainly can't hurt!"
"I was JUST talking to our 11 year old about this! Psychologically (this is according to a professional) I am between ages 15 and 18 or 19 or so. I never was allowed to grow up by an overprotective mom (I was bullied because my immaturity), and then when I became an adult, they finally figured out that I have Asperger's. I had all the ""symptoms""--unable to socialize, unable to make eye contact, etc. and nobody ever knew it. That had been in the 80s, so it wasn't even that well-known then. I am now 47 and I think truly I am going through a 2nd adolescence. Problems that I've had hidden inside me since I was a teen are now coming to the surface and I struggle to relate to people my own age. I relate better to my 16 year old son and 14 year old son than I do someone my own age.

I also agree with what fiannafritz said. We all grow and mature at our own rates...and some of us not at all. You should talk to someone--it might make you feel better. Good luck!"
"It’s possible that you’re experiencing an episode of hypomania (mild mania) brought on by stress and sleep deprivation. Sleep loss triggers mania in many people with bipolar disorder. Your history of depression increases the likelihood that you’re having a bipolar episode.

How old are you? If you’re in your early 20s, as your username suggests, you’re around the average age of diagnosis for bipolar disorder. 

Hypomania feels amazing. I understand why you’re looking for ways to keep it going, but it really isn’t something you want to fuck around with. If this is the onset of bipolar disorder, chasing the high will lead to one of two outcomes: either you’ll crash into depression, or you’ll spiral upward into full-blown mania and possibly psychosis. It’s not worth the risk. 

Enjoy the feeling while it lasts. Get as much sleep as possible for the next few nights. If you’re still feeling super energized in 2-3 days, see a doctor.  "
"there's a video called ""what causes depression"" by DepressionOutreach on youtube. it kind of explains how medication helps with the chemical imbalance. maybe show that to your dad.

I grew up in a family who doesn't believe in mental illness, so I know how frustrating and sad it can be that you can't be understood by the people that should understand you the best, or at least try their best to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Insulin to a diabetic is pretty much the same as antidepressants to depressed people.

&amp;#x200B;

and the end results without the medication can be the same result. I don't mean to be harsh, but it's true.

I'm so glad your mom is supportive, she sounds amazing. Maybe chat with your mom and come up with a strategy to get your dad to understand. I'm sure the psychiatrist can help explain what your brain is doing (or not doing) that's causing you to feel this way and what the medication would be doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for the time being, if you're feeling like killing yourself, and you feel like you don't have anyone to talk to, call the hotline 1800273TALK. it's sometimes really nice to talk to someone who is just there wanting to listen to you and talk to you and help you, you know what I mean?

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I had ""gotten over"" my depression from when I was in high school. now 16 years later, I finally understand that my brain chemistry is just a little off and needed a little help functioning properly.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for sharing on here. It's important to talk about. There are so many people who are in the same situation as you who are afraid to talk about it. maybe they'd see this and feel that they can go talk to someone about it, you know? You're doing amazing."
"Thanks for answering. Sounds like you really have been trying. Some people's definition of ""trying"" is different to others'. :)

I do really feel for you. Working that hard to find a hobby without success must be really disheartening. All I can say is keep at it and try to push through the initial bit. If you find something that you seem to enjoy at first, stick at it until it's a habit. For me, things really become a habit (i.e. when I don't have to force myself to do it any more) after around three months. Then it's just a thing I do, like brushing my teeth or going to work.

Something out there will eventually click for you but, while obviously I am not qualified to diagnose you, it does sound to me like there might be some other underlying issue that you might be able to get some treatment for. Usually I'd expect that one of these things would have clicked by now, but maybe it's just bad luck and you haven't found the right activity yet.

I just worry that you'll put all your eggs in one basket with your girlfriend and risk putting too much pressure on the relationship - I'm sure you understand the dangers there.

Honestly I wasn't expecting that level of effort from you so I'm sorry for perhaps misjudging you a little, but also I do admire how hard you have been working to find other pursuits. That in itself says a lot about your character.

It might not be a bad idea to talk to your girlfriend about this. She might have some great ideas about things you could try that you haven't thought of yet. It might also take the pressure off a bit knowing that she understands what you're going through. That's obviously your call though.

I am just wondering if maybe you are generally a bit depressed and perhaps that's the reason you're struggling to apply yourself. Maybe a course of anti depressants could help you. But I'm not certain, because you have more drive than I would expect from somebody in a depressed state. Maybe you're just a fighter, or maybe it's something else entirely. I'd recommend seeing a professional (again?) to see if they can suggest anything.

Sorry I can't be more help, all I can say is keep at it and maybe the next thing you try you will fall in love with. It only has to happen once. :)"
"For some reason I cant help but think OP's name is very ironic.

Hi my name is deeeeeaaaattthhhhh and I'm always here if you need me.... 

Just sayin, seems genuine and creepy at the same time.  LOL"
How is that unethical? We exist as a minority community within a minority - a minority inside about 5-10% of the population. Saying that he will eventually see me in drag is... a factual statement.

I do my best to do some mental gymnastics and turn it into a positive. I have told my fiancé that I should probably see a therapist so I’m seeing my primary physician tomorrow and mentioning it.
I think starting to do one good thing or thing you don't hate each day can lead to a positive feedback loop. You do more and more over time. It helps me a great deal when recovering from a low place
I'm about as majorly depressed as it gets and I've never verbally abused my loved ones or anyone because of it. Excusing his abusive behavior is just creating space for him to be even more abusive.
I've also only heard of this effect when mixing with SSRI. Do you happen to know which types of herbal medications to avoid while taking SJW? I'll have to do more research... gets a bit overwhelming
"I've struggled with empathy problems when I was younger. But I was the opposite. I lacked empathy. I'm getting better at it now though.

If you haven't already, go to a therapist. It might help you."
Is your family doctor the people that you've been trying to schedule an appointment with? Or is that a psychiatrist. Because scheduling an appointment with your family doctor is better than nothing.
"It's hard to tell without asking you the right questions but your description looks like someone going through this.

As always, go see a doctor, he will know how to help you. Hope to see you better"
"My cousin has BPD and is an amazing person. She has really helped me through a lot of shit. BPD is unfairly demonized, you aren't a bad person because you have BPD. Don't let a diagnosis define you."
Pharmacist here: that’s strange I’ve never heard of anyone having issues with it. We learned in school that one of its pros is how few side effects it causes... though I do know one is headache
She was diagnosed with leukaemia a few days ago and I don’t feel my mental health is much of a priority for her right now. I would rather sort myself out and then let her know when she’s better
"Sounds rather scary. And you’re sure he wasn’t on his phone waiting for someone to answer his call, or listening to music or a YouTube video? Are you able to have discussions about his PTSD/OCD?"
"There a lot of different degrees of depression and not everyone has all of the same/amount of symptoms. For example, I’ve been diagnosed with dysthymia which is chronic milder form of depression. "
"Threatening to kill oneself to persuade or pressure someone else into a relationship is literally an abuse tactic. Call the police on him if you think he is a danger to himself, you or anyone else. "
"What kind of therapy have you tried? Maybe look into EMDR, somatic experiencing, and TRE. Definitely see someone who specializes in trauma because that's a common source for dissociative disorders. "
"Yea, when I get the opportunity  I plan to, in the meantime I was hoping to get some feedback. If anyone else has experienced this or similiar feelings, what they did or if it's related to anything."
Yeah maybe so. But I've also dealt with chronic motivation and other similar issues. I spent two years essentially just laying in bed and staring at the wall. I know how difficult this stuff can be.
You didnt offend me. I am not reckless ever. It just hurts to actually hear it from a professional. It has the potential to be very destructive and people freak out about it BC of that...rightly so.
"me too. did because was suicide prevention day and i realized nothing changes and ill be stuck this way doesnt matter anymore

i hope you take care of your wounds and bandage. infections are painful"
"I understand that, and I can't tell you not to, I can only tell you of my experience with that.. I was agoraphobic for two years. It didn't start all at once, it started with wanting to shut out the world, but slowly increased to the point I couldn't peep out of my window or answer the phone. It feels safe at first, but it's very, very hard to get out of and it creates a deep sense of loneliness and longing to be able to be a part of the world again."
"I’m not sure what drug you got high on, but it’s not uncommon to have mental breakdowns or mild psychotic breaks induced by drugs. There’s a common misconception that marijuana is always safe but I’ve known several people who have had mental breakdowns after eating a brownie or getting too high. Alcohol, pharmaceuticals, etc can all cause issues. But since marijuana is unregulated in most states you don’t always know what you’re getting. "
"Like you said - you, your family, your friends, even the girl all know you well enough to know it's all a load of crap! The don't believe it, so that crazy mum has no power at all. If she did try and do anything everyone would side with you no doubt, you don't need to panic about her. She'll just crawl back under her rock and your life is gonna be okay, she can't harm someone who hasn't done anything wrong and who has loyal support to back that up :)"
"Thank you for the insight! I’m going to talk to the doc about trying Lexapro or it’s generic brand to see if there’s any changes.

Even today as I’m typing this, I’m experiencing out of this world anxiety. I’m definitely high functioning with it, and get done the shit I need to do, but it makes enjoying my life very difficult when I’m feeling this way. 

Here’s to calmer days, with more serenity and clarity of mind. ������"
"Yeah, my obsession AND compulsions can be bad. VERY destructive. I have to keep a tight rein on them, which wears me out.  It is part of me, and I am having a hard time accepting it and embracing that fact so I can heal it properly. The anxiety that sets it off is hard enough to deal with, but then I get into this loop where I feel anxious, give in to my compulsions, feel good for a short time, feel depressed, feel anxious again, rinse and repeat. :("
Yeah...Pyromania (UGH UGH UGH there I said it) isn't all that common and the psych I spoke with briefly looked at me like I was growing a new head when I told him. *smh* I had to pick a strange disorder to have surface in my life. This is just recent too. I am 47 and it is JUST rearing its head in the past 6 months or so. Wth? Sigh. Thanks for being so kind and understanding though. The world needs more people like yourself and the people here. &lt;3
"Yes but it's a continuous process of coping with your illness. It doesn't go away, but you ""get better"" at coping with it, it becomes way easier, and you can turn into a kind of super power if you're able to hone it.

Keep trying new things. Maybe therapy isn't the answer for you if it's been done 5 times and still isn't working. Throw some random things into the mix, record your changes, and see what even KINDA works. I believe in you. Best of luck!"
"I don’t know how to find a hobby.

All I have done in my spare time for the last 10 years is video games. I don’t enjoy video games anymore.

I don’t know what to do with myself. I enjoy going to the gym but I’m weak and can’t force myself to go consistently.

I try to go 3 times a week for an hour and a half but this week I went once and last week I went twice. After work I’m too tired to go, and in the morning I don’t have the self discipline to force myself out of bed at 5 am. Then there is my diet which is iffy.

Other than that I don’t have hobbies. I tried to learn to enjoy reading but I can’t finish a book.

Honestly the only thing I semi enjoy is working, I don’t know why.
"
"Thank you. Nobody has really explained it like that to me before. It's more like an answer but you actually explained why, the differences, and your own story with it and that makes alot of sense. It definitely makes me not think 100% no anymore I do feel like I want to see one now. Maybe just to get some sort of idea like you said why I feel this way. Maybe I do have a mental disability I just need to find out instead of saying no and assuming everything is bad. Honestly thought when I post this no one would reply or even give it a comment. And I appreciate everyone's comment especially yours. Really helped me out and just seeing others care for another even if you dont know me means alot. Thank you
"
"People don't listen to you or your psychiatrist/psychologist?  If it's the first, who cares? Nobody listens to anybody really.   If it's the professionals, you need new professionals.  My dr. thinks my wearing all black is a red flag, and if I even imply thinking about suicide, she's on it (with like a contract and all that). 

If your dr. aren't listening to you, please find another one or talk to them straight about it. There are a lot of dr in my big city, and i've had some horrible ones, and it is hard, but there are really good ones out there.  It is a sign of the symptoms of depression to settle or give up, but if you keep looking, and you live in a big enough city, there really is great help out there.  

If it is just people, my family has never understood what I am going through, even though I think a lot of them have some of the same symptoms.  They are in denial about themselves and it's just not personal.  Nobody has a right to judge you.  "
"Right, but you totally are, and hey, they’ve supported you at least in some way until this point. 

You are not from your parents generation and trust me, do not give up on your dream of pursuing a degree. Almost all jobs these days require some form of a degree, even secretarial jobs are now calling for an associates. 

My mom has worked in managerial positions all her life, even helping my dad build their business from bottom up before their divorce. She recently tried looking for a job as her former employment was liquidating and job postings called for associates degree for administrative positions paying less than $12 an hour, it’s absurd. 

If you are looking into being a therapist you may qualify for the loan forgiveness program depending on what line of work you go into. Give that a look! If your lender qualifies and you work in some sort of publicly beneficial sector, and make all minimum payments for 10 years, your loans can be forgiven. "
"1. They work for you, not the other way around.  

2. It is totally fine to fire them if you are not satisfied with their performance.

3. It is also totally fine if therapy does not end up working for you.

4. Watch what you say and watch how you say it.  Whether a therapist thinks they need to sic the cops on you is up to their sole discretion, interpretation, and amusement.  Something you think is harmless might be something that scares the piss out of them or makes them angry enough to sic the cops on you, either as punishment or to cover their own ass.  Do not give them any ammunition that you absolutely do not have to unless you trust them completely.

5. Never trust a therapist completely.  

6. The first batch of sessions will be tough, because even though *you* know why you're there, *they* don't, and they have other clients.  Expect them to forget/never learn/need frequent reminders about key details, goals, and concerns you have until they decide to bother committing your story to memory.

7. Trust your gut.  If your gut tells you something is wrong, something is probably wrong.

8. If your therapist tries to sell you anything beyond their services as a therapist, they are a shitty therapist."
"i left school when i was 11, regretted it every day since. yes, i hated it and was very depressed but for me online schooling was absolute garbage. i guess it’s good if you love working on computer and have self motivation. but i didn’t end up with GCSE qualifications like people that finish school, i do have the equivalent but it’s difficult explaining that to employers etc, i ended up having a tutor instead, which imo is far better and instead of explaining your personal story like you have to with online schooling you can just say your parents thought it was a better option or something if that makes sense. i’m a lot happier now, but looking back at my life i wish i had pushed through everything i was feeling back then and stayed in school, it’s my biggest regret. you know when people say “if you could go back in time and change one thing” my answer would be i’d stay in school. it’s your life though, do what you think is best for you. as for your parents, try your best to explain it to them, and the school councillor should totally understand your situation (unless they’re useless) but back when i tried to leave school the councillor was amazing. good luck with everything though. "
"what bugs me the most is that they can't differentiate the disorder from the person. There's people that use their depression and anxiety to manipulate others. Someone that has BPD and is bad at using their coping mechanisms and refuses to get medicated is a toxic individual, BPD or no.

And I am not about to hold people responsible for ""fixing"" someone but it is an unfair generalization, despite most of the personality disorders being more volatile, such as BPD, anti-social personality disorder, NPD, Bipolar, if someone is medicated and good at handling it, it's like someone who has ADHD well managed vs someone who has their ADHD not managed at all and shows up late for important meetings and forgets to pay their power bill and fritters away all their important bill money on random things. Like, know your problems, manage them well so you don't hurt others, and it's fine.

I do disagree that the generalization is unfair, but I also understand someone being wary of certain disorders due to past experiences. I actually do help random people when they need to see red flags of untreated mental illness/personality disorders early so they know to set proper boundaries and make sure stuff doesn't get worse..."
"Funnily enough. I used to get sleep paralysis around the same time the AIWS episodes were at their most frequent, about age 9 or 10. So that's quite interesting you bring that up.

During your panic attacks did you experience any: 

palisomesthesia: (http://inhn.org/cn/home/cordoba-unit/education/carlos-morra-and-ernst-franzek-psychopathological-symptoms/palisomesthesia.html)

Quick Motion Phenomenon: (http://hallucinations.enacademic.com/1610/quick-motion_phenomenon)

Or any form of dysmetropsia https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dysmetropsia

And would you conclude that the panic attacks bought about these experiences, or would you say that the experiences bought about the panic? That is to say, do you think you were panicking because things were going weird, or that you were panicking, and things were also going weird? In respect to order of causality?

I'm interested in this, because for years I was told what happened to me was ""panic attacks"" and for a long while that's what I thought they were, until I had a bought of *actual* panic attacks and realised that they were almost completely bodily sensory / a totally different type of attack, and not nearly as vividly so perceptually altering like these other episodes had always been. though obviously panic was so central to the stuff in general, it wasn't until I was particularly introspective about it all that I managed to notice that distinction.

So I'm interested in probing your experiences a bit more."
"What is one small thing you can start doing to change any aspect of what you described in your post? Maybe verbally telling your girlfriend every day that you’re grateful for her. Maybe making a priority to go for a walk outside and get some fresh air. Maybe take a minute every day and write down 3 things you are thankful for. Maybe just telling yourself that you don’t HAVE to be happy, and that being content is perfectly okay. 

Either way, it seems like you are dealing with a lot on your plate. Start small. Baby steps. Focus on small changes. Focus on being present. Notice your triggers: do your shoulders become tense when you’re angry? Does your breathing become mor labored? Maybe you clench your jaw? Start paying attention to your physical cues, and when you catch them, take a deep breath and try to ground yourself, and be proud that you caught it. 

When you become frustrated at something, ask yourself “what is this trying to teach me? What can I learn from this situation?” 

Basically, the choice to change is completely in your hands. You hold the key to become whoever you want, but you have to have the courage to take that first step towards change. You can do it. It will take hard work, dedication and consistency, but if it’s something you want, it’s worth all that and more. 

Also, maybe try speaking to a therapist/counselor. Does your school offer one? That’d be a good place to start as well.

Best of luck to you! You got this! "
"So, there was this guy. He was 21, I was 17, and we connected super well. I’ve always gotten along better with people older than me, most likely because my brother is 8 years older and he was my hero. Anyways, two months go by and we’ve had a super great time: picnics, feeding ducks bird seed who would then become aggressive about the bird seed, catching fish with our hands, walking in rivers in the middle of the woods. And then he dumped me at exactly two months over text, and then I realized he was cheating on me with a “friend” of mine. I was almost institutionalized because my depression got so bad, the only reason I wasn’t was because I had an appointment with my counselor in a couple days. I didn’t eat for a whole month and lost about 20 pounds somehow. And then I realized I was way too good for him. I realized that I wasn’t being shallow when I said no to having sex with him even though he’d constantly pressure me, I wasn’t shallow for wishing he’d stop making “jokes” that hurt my feelings.
And then things were great. I realized that despite him making me feel worthless without him, I was a whole person all on my own and I was happy. And now I’m about to celebrate my anniversary with my fiancée and things couldn’t be better. I’m happy. There will be rough patches but at the end of the day, I couldn’t be happier or more excited for whatever it is that my future holds. Not only does it get better, OP, it gets great. Work on self-love. Remember that YOU define who you are, not anyone else. Make the best of everything, enjoy your time being single, make friends, have fun, be the best damn dietitian I know you can be. I believe in you, and you’re going to be just fine."
"There are a lot of opposing and contradicting values and motives in my head that make it difficult to be honest to myself and others. I do not trust myself and my perception of life, so I am torn between what I believe to be good/right  and my distrust towards my own judgement of these beliefs. 
When other people come into play it becomes more difficult to decide on how to act/ what to tell/ whom to trust and so on. 
I might tell my therapist that I am not actively planning my suicide, because of a multitude of contradicting reasons; 
- I dont want to make it more difficult to take my own life or endanger my ""freedom"" to do so.
- I have spent most of my life planning my own suicide, I never did it, so I do not want to alert anyone now because it probably wont happen anyway.
- I do not want to talk about it because I believe it to be more consttuctive to discuss other issues.
- I think that if I managed to take my own life, it would in fact be better for my environment.
- I might have made ""positive"" life changes recently, that I do not want the therapist to question or critizize.
- I am tired of confronting my thoughts and just want to end this session so I can distract myself again from my own mind.
- I have admitted to planning my suicide several times in the past before and this has always lead to difficult/ painful periods where I would be ""brought back on my feet"" in a psychiatric clinic but never with any long-term effects. 
- No matter how hard I try, no matter how hard  others try to help me, everyone will fail because I am in fact, a big parasitic failure that does not want to get better and is sucking out the resources of its environment.
- Maybe this time I will finally manage to escape life.
- I do not deserve a happy life anyway, nor would it be possible for me to achieve.
- and so on....

This is my personal experience, maybe you have some contradictary thoughts yourself that make it difficult to be honest. Its helpful to talk these through with a person you trust, try to make out difficulf feelings and why you might have them/ why they might contradict each other and why 100% honesty is so difficult.

I would think that no one is able to be 100% honest with themselves and/or others. The people that believe they are, are unaware of or ignore their contrasting values and thoughts. They are not aware of how uncontrollable their thoughts are to themselves , and how very controllable their thoughts are by their sub-consciousness and other factors.

"Awareness for personality disorders aside from ASPD or BPD is near nonexistant, and even those few that are well-known have awful stigmas against them. I wish that people paid more attention to them."
"BPD is often misdiagnosed C-PTSD because C-PTSD isn't in the DSM but it's very real and exists in the ICD-11. Just saying if you really really think BPD diagnosis doesn't fit, look into complex PTSD."
Depending on your state there should be programs to help you with that. In my state there are behavioral health care offices that they call health homes. They have people who can help you with this.

And I also don't like people respond to Thank You with ""No Problem"" ... well I didn't think we had a problem! What ever happened to You're welcome. Ugh."

"I can't offer any advice, but it sure sounds like you married my ex boyfriend.

I said she’s “not all there” because that’s the most sensitive way I know to describe this situation without jumping to conclusions. She’s not all there, and that’s fucking okay. Me and her will work it out together. That’s not fucking casual disrespect, unless your a mother don’t pass fucking judgement on me.  "
It makes me so incredibly happy that this has helped you feel some hope and process some things. For me getting diagnosed was such a relief it felt like I could breath again. If you ever have any more questions or anything else feel free to PM me (even though I’m terrible at checking them). Something about your experience feels so familiar and if the things that I went through/am going through help anyone it means a lot. Keep trudging along friend.
"Looks like you have some decisions to make. I mean, you're right; less time spent studying will probably affect grades. I think though 'zero' extracurricular activity could be just as bad. For me, being a shut-in probably didn't help my academic performance.

No one can tell you what to do. You sound like you have a clear grasp of the equation. My only suggestion would be to keep something, just as a way to break up the study. Or whatever.

Good luck!"
"No it's not, did you even read my post? That place is basically the definition of what I was talking about. It's a place for people to feel good about themselves and tell others *don't*. It's against the rules to advise anything else, it's not objective, and it only takes a short look at that place to see how many assumptions people make. Further, everyone there assumes suicide is inherently tragic, which is a cultural view I personally disagree with."
"You harbor that resentment towards her whether or not she sees the post. You're an adult, and she's the child here.

"Hello there, since you are diagnosed (as I am), it would be most helpful if you had a therapist or psychologist with whom you can share your thoughts. Because we're not trained experts, it's not very easy to get specific help here. 

I know that depression and anxiety can cause conflicting or dangerous thoughts / feelings / urges. So please consider seeking help from a professional, that can help you go through these feelings, rationalize them and help you learn control them.

When I was younger, I also had intrusive thoughts - they went away, with help and time.

I wish you all the best, I believe that you are a caring and loving person, so I believe that you will be able to overcome this.

Take care."
"I fell down a pit once. I let go. It honestly woke me up. But it was a violent spectacle for those around me. I know I did not have your pain. Keep faith in yourself. You are refusing medication perhaps because it is not what you need. Listen to yourself. Take all the time you need. Don’t hold expectations of yourself. Don’t judge yourself. Be and maybe realise what is a reflection of your pain. You seem to know the sources. Maybe with time and clarity of mind you can find the space to let go. But let go on the terms that are you. Not let go into the terms of the expectations and fears others reflect to you. 

You express yourself intelligently. That is you talking. Try to listen and try to learn. "
"I have been taking Effexor for the last two years in various dosages (I'm on 150 right now, but I've also taken 100 and 77 in the past) and the withdrawal symptoms have been terrible every time I have stopped taking it for whatever reason, even if just for a couple of days. Dizziness, stomach problems, headaches, sensibility to light and sound, extreme low energy and depressing thoughts and yes, even suicidal thoughts.
Effexor can be really helpful for depression and anxiety but it is known for its withdrawal symptoms. If you really want to stop taking it please contact your doctor so he can guide you through the whole process; it will take a while and it won't be easy, but it won't affect you as much."
"I'm afraid, OP, that I must pretty much agree with this. Much as it is important for people to be able to discuss serious issues, other people may not want to hear about them. Some people may have serious problems of their own and use the workplace as a form of refuge and not want to be reminded. Everyone has different weather.

I am not blaming you for anything here, especially if it really was eavesdropping by the other person (it's hard to know without knowing exactly how it happened). I encourage you not to get upset or discouraged about this. I would just find ways to continue to talk in ways that work for you without bothering anyone else. E.g., take the person you were talking with out to lunch."
"This is really helpful! If it's just a side effect of the depression as a whole then there's not much to be done on my end tbh. As I said in my post, my friend has had psychotic symptoms with their depression. Unfortunately, their parents won't let them take medication, and they don't want to take medication because the adjustment period will prevent them from doing well in school (a sentiment I suspect is backed up by things their parents are saying). And psychosis is generally difficult to treat without medicine, I think.

The not wanting a therapist isn't really unfounded paranoia, tbh. They've had some really bad experiences in the past. 

I want to clarify that my friend is in their 20s and in grad school, I guess that wasn't clear from the post. So they definitely aren't a teenager. As far as I know, they've only ever been briefly treated for depression.

I just wanted to see if anyone knew about this particular feeling of being dead and replaced."
"You’re definitely right. With this being my first corporate job, I don’t know if this is the norm with these large companies so it’s giving me a bad first impression of the corporate world in general.

I am in a rotation program, and I was quickly moved to another department with no warning. I was told that the new department is a high turnover position, and was very stressful.  This department was going through a manager change, and someone had recently just left. They told me about long hours that were required for this department as well, so it was a complex situation for someone new to get in.

Being new to a company, I didn’t think much of it. Being young and naive,  I was determined to make the best of this opportunity. I’ve never been a person to complain, and I just take what is given and work hard to achieve results to be successful. The poor work/life balance, lack of structure, and lack of communication is just taking a toll on me. "
Fellow anxiety ridden sleep deprived (from anxiety) redditor here. I'd recommend journaling/blogging about the daily stress in your life and things that you think/feel are giving you anxiety. My therapist had me start doing that and it helped tremendously for my sleep. Also have you tried taking Benadryl? In the beginning of my anxiety ridden insomnia I took two Benadryl before bed and it enabled me to not only fall asleep but to stay asleep through at least 80-90% of the night and when I woke up the next morning I was not groggy or exhausted most if not all day like when I'd take melatonin. If Benadryl does not help I'd highly recommend Zzquil. It does not make you groggy or exhausted the next day either. I have not tried the off brand so I cannot say if it's as good/works as well as the name brand does. If neither of those work for you then I would definitely make sure that you talk to your primary care physician about your insomnia from anxiety and how you cannot sleep at night and how you have tried several different over the counter medications to no avail. My doctor put me on Trazodone. It's an older anti-depressant that doctors found out really just makes patients sleepy so it's oftentimes prescribed for their patients with depression and or anxiety that have insomnia. :) But you \*must\* make sure that you are committing to getting enough sleep at night (8-10 hours a night) or you \*will\* feel groggy the next morning!. I hope that this helps! :)
"I'm really sorry. I've had losses before but my dog crying out in pain and dying in my arms haunts me still. Fuck even writing that puts tears in my eyes after all those years. I guess it's just thinking about it and  about your loss. I understand that kind of pain. It doesn't  necessarily ever stop hurting, the memory of our friend, the love and the bond that we shared,  the tragedy of it all. 

I will say to you that you should talk about this with someone. If you don't have someone close that won't get tired of hearing about it I would recommend just seeing a therapist for a little while. It's not silly. This kind of thing can mess a person up for a long time. But if not it's important to talk about it. Don't hold back any feelings or tears. It'll slow the process down.   I will share with you some links because I'm not a professional, there are related articles at the bottom of the pages  
[How Do We Grieve](http://www.drchristinahibbert.com/dealing-with-grief/)

[The 5 stages of Grief](http://www.drchristinahibbert.com/dealing-with-grief/5-stages-of-grief/)

There is heartache and love. All that remains after 10+ years. It doesn't hurt as bad but I still have rare moments of utter sadness. Usually late at night. There is no absolute cure or changing the past. But there is a process to grief and grieving. I'm only recently learning about it. It  helps with all loss. Don't go it alone. Get help, learn what you can about it. And share. Don't keep it in."
"Haha I loved how you turned that around. You made me smile so you get the points for today. 
I'm seriously thinking about going A&amp;E but if I can get through tonight then there's always tomorrow :)"
"Honestly, Google coping skills. Or pinterest is gr8. Find ideas and things that work for you. Sorry this is vague af but I believe discovering your own coping skills are what make them most effective."
"I am not your doctor and not qualified to diagnose you, but it could also be OCD. Or something else entirely (like a stress reaction, etc). If you can, I'd definitely recommend going to see a doctor. "
"I've been in therapy for depression and anxiety, my mom is bipolar schizophrenic, and I still don't really know much about the disorders you listed as ""not well known""... it is quite a dire situation."
I've gotten that my entire life. I was pretty shy growing up as a kid. I didn't start opening up until after I graduated high school. But unfortunately that stigma is still present in today's society.
In my experience lack of ability to stay organized and in budget is a symptom of my depression too. It creates a feedback loop. I’m depressed because I’m poor. I’m poor because I’m depressed.
"It takes a while to realise it, since it was so normal. It could also be your brain chemistry. Some of us are born wired to feel bad. But you know now, so you can give yourself love and care to grow. "
"It's something that should be established immediately. If it hasn't then it should be. Better late than never.

A therapist also isn't a monolithic advice giver. You need to communicate your concerns."
"Ive watched my best friends mom give years of her life to a man that always just needed one more chance. Its a sad thing and it really happens to people with the best hearts, so take care of yourself."
Just gather up the courage and tell your parents how you feel. They would probably rather have you be honest so that you can get the help that you need. It's not weird to ask about seeing a therapist.
Normal? Probably not. Are there people in the same boat? Absolutely. I just turned 22 and have been isolating for almost 6 months. But I would highly advise against it. Seek HELP. It only gets worse.
Not sure if anyone has mentioned this but some jobs offer free or cheap therapy sessions. It’s not usually pushed hard because they want you to use the insurance but contact you’re HR department.
"Talk to us. What's going on?  
I am here to listen.

Here is a joke for you (It is pathetic, sorry!)  
What do you call a snail on a ship?

A SNAILOR!! \*\*rim shot\*\*

You can message me anytime. :)"
"That sounds ace! I keep hearing more and more about this genetic testing stuff, sounds ace!
Have you noticed a big difference since you had it done and got different medication or supplements for it? "
That would be my suggestion. Be prepared for them to ask lots of clarifying questions about what you mean and how exactly you feel. It’s the best way for them to get an idea of what you are feeling
That’s a good idea of looking at a schedule. I’ll definitely try that method. It’s making it into a routine that’s going to be a tad difficult. I blame that on myself. But I do want to change.
"The usual : ""oh its not big issue"" ""I don't want to be on meds"" and ""maybe they won't take me seriously at all."" I guess everyone with mental health issues seek help of professional as a last resort. "
What? You learned discipline when you started a business. I’m in the process of starting a business right now and the only worrying thing for me is that I’ll fall on my face when depression hits.
"Wow. I never upvoted something so enthusiastically as this. I wish I could have participated in this too. I had tears in my eyes through the whole thing...and it touched my heart. 

Wow. I loved this!"
You temporarily have some memory loss. It only really effects stuff right before and after the treatment but it comes back. And no it dosent decrease someone's intelligence level. That's just not true
You'll know burnout when you have it. It's like hitting a brick wall physically and mentally. You have no motivation. energy and you are exhausted beyond belief all the time. Do you feel that way now?
thank you &lt;3 mental illnesses are such a harsh thing to deal with. youre also strong for being able to endure it. PTSD and panic disorder are surely such a pain to handle and im so sorry for that.
"thank you! and I just briefly explained that I was struggling with mental health issues, but it isn’t that high end of a job, which is totally okay for me. I’m just happy to have a schedule again."
"the other traits i also mentioned, hating people one second and liking someone another. mood swings. it's a lot more than just fear of abandonment. and i'm almost 20 so it isn't puberty at this point."
"Do you have any mutual friends that could give you any kind of assessment of the situation? 

They don’t necessarily have to know about his illness but maybe if you can get some picture of how he is actually acting (instead of having to go by his refusal to interact) you might be able to judge what’s going on with him based on his past behavior.

If there’s nobody that you both know that sees him relatively regularly then this idea won’t work. "
"God honey, i just want to give you a big hug. As someone born in 90 who has been through some similar experiences only with my mom, one thing that's hard to see now is what an amazing adult you're going to be and the amazing mother you can be if you chose to become one eventually. 

Your parents have failed you, but as an adult reading your post, i see what an amazing adult is coming out the other side as soon as she finds her strength in all of this. "
"I had one interview once that was cancelled on me while I was on my way to it.  I was in the lobby when I heard a slew of ""I'm sorrys"".   

This is so unlike me but I went ballistic.  I told them in no uncertain terms that this is not the way to conduct business and ""I'm sorry"" does not excuse it.  I was fit to be tied.

As I was driving out, I saw a police car driving in.  I just know that I was a topic of conversation in their next mandatory meeting."
"I'll add that I also, unfortunately, just get tired of people. And right on as far as 2-3 years. I'm 34 and it's just how it's been, nothing on purpose. It's usually because the relationship , friend or significant other, was built on something that just doesn't hold my interest anymore. I also start to get really judgmental towards them. Keep finding new relationships though because isolation just snowballs into more depression and negative feelings. "
"In my experience the first time I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder"" I tried two antidepressants before they found one that worked for me but only at really high dosage (effexor). I too was dealing with some really bad issues, but I noticed a huge difference in the way I was handling it. To be honest it saved my life at that time. Hang in there, dont expect miracles, but medication can be a huge help. I wish you all the best, hang in there. "
"So what did you do? How is your progress going?

I just dont know what to do. I dont want to wait too long and regret never trying something, but at the same time im not sure I can do it. 

I want to get that degree also because of the financial stability like you had mentioned. There are so many opportunities for engineers i see basically everywhere in my state. (Michigan). The opportunities just arnt as plentiful, or pay as well in my current field. "
"Sure. A great introduction into DBT is The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook, which I find simple and easy to follow. If you'd like something more in-depth, DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets was written by the creator of DBT, Marsha Linehan. There's a lot out there, and I own many, but I find myself coming back to those two most often. If you find that those aren't resonating with you, or you'd like more suggestions let me know. "
"Well i think you have some major problems but i also sense a bit of unreadiness or stubbornness on your part.  Why does it matter that u r nonbinary if you see a male therapist, the point is that you need a new therapist because this one is not listening to you...if your mother don't listen to you that's a significant problem...  you need support and according to you, you are not getting getting it. Rather than trying, I hear you give excuses...so GL. "
"You have to try to get out of your past self and do everything differently, once I started ADD medication, I totally lost my self and I rarely feel emotion now, but I'm still working on building a new personality which makes me a whole new person. This doesn't mean to take meds for it, but before the meds I separated myself from all my friends, I went to a school where I didn't know anyone to make new friends, and that is how I got out of my past life."
"Zoloft made me suicidal. I was prescribed it the first time I was in the psych ward in January 2016 and after I got out, I quickly got worse. I stopped taking it and didn't get back on antidepressants until late 2017. 

I'm glad it's helping you with your depression but it sounds like it's not good for your anxiety. You could always try a different antidepressant. I found that Celexa wasn't helpful for me either, but Wellbutrin works amazingly for me. "
"&gt;SSRI’s would be taking away the suicidal thoughts if it was depression.

Completely wrong there. And as already mentioned, many SSRIs can increase suicidal thoughts/ideations - mostly during the first period of use.

Medication works differently on everyone, and person A suffering from depression might benefit from SSRI X, while person B suffering from depression might feel no improvements whatsoever or even the opposite while being on that same SSRI.

Why do you think there are literally thousands of different meds out there? Not only in the SSRI class, and not only antidepressants ... If everyone with a depression and/or suicidal thoughts would do good on one med, why even release others at all?"
"From what I've read, NPD and narcissism is usually a facade that a person exhibits to compensate for the worthlessness that they feel very deep down inside, and obviously childhood trauma and regret are the cause of it. But narcissists 99.9% of the time cannot fathom that they are narcissists or treat others badly in ways they don't deserve. I don't think you're a narcissist, especially if you've only recently been told that and you immediately researched about it and completely accepted it. Sue me but not everything has to be medicalised. Sometimes sadness is just sadness, not depression. And sometimes selfishness is just selfishness, not a narcissistic personality. In any case, if you're aware of whatever you've got that means you can at least work on it. PS I don't know the full context of your situation. Maybe, just maybe, this family member is exaggerating things and making you feel bad for some reason or another. Maybe they are the real narcissist."
"&gt; mental health condition

ADHD is genetic. It's one of the most genetically inheritable disorders in existence. It's so genetic, physical head-trauma accounts for more cases than environmental factors. In fact, the only two ways you can really get ADHD is to inherit it (have the genetics + in utero stresses = fucked up dopamine receptors) or be hit in the head hard enough to cause brain damage.

ADHD is also co-morbid with other conditions more often than not. If you have ADHD, you should get screened for literally everything else, because this disorder rarely comes alone.

&gt; hyper child, bad behaviour etc, now he is older it has developed into  compulsive lying, no care for others, grades dropping in school,  stealing 

Sounds like Anti-social-personality-disorder (ASPD), or Opposition-defiance-disorder (ODD which is co-morbid with ADHD + bad parenting in MANY cases).

ADHD doesn't mean hyperactive, but hyperactivity is in many cases.

Does he have: Bad memory, terrible or non-existent planning skills, difficulty in working towards things he talks about planning to do, rejection sensitivity, constantly forgetting what you or he was just talking about, constantly loses things he just had in his hand a minute ago, starts anything from small tasks (EG microwaving food for 2 minutes, then coming back an hour later to microwave the same food only to realize he already did) to large tasks (EG a project that he started with gusto and dropped... and it's the 2nd or third in the last few weeks) and somehow winds up doing a dozen other unrelated things before realizing he forgot what he originally intended to do, a chronic inability to stay on fucking topic, non-stop talking about every little thing that flies through his head, difficulty in choosing words or effectively communicating points, and extreme difficulty in initiating ""boring"" tasks (emphasis on initiating) but not necessarily an issue with physical tasks?

My coworker with ADHD for example, talked about moving his couch. For three days. Before he finally just fucking did it. Across the living room. That it was already in. He spends so much time every morning looking for keys or phone or wallet he's almost never to work on time. He's never figured out a structured morning routine or any efficient means of planning time use. He's fun, but hard to hang out with, and never really has anything to say.

&gt; stealing around £1000, stealing more, faking remorse to get out of punishments, and the mother still wants to help with his homework and refuses to think there could be anything wrong with him

Oh he's fucked for life. This is both bad genes and bad parenting. He's not going to be a good person, and there's very little you can do about it individually."
"Derealisation. Most indescribable feeling. 

It gives me a sense of reality feeling altered. Reality will feel unreal, and too real at the same time. It’s often involuntary paired with thoughts and epiphanies about existence and the nature of reality.

Out of no where it feels like reality becomes this really foreign thing. Theres a distinct feeling of time disappearing and an overwhelmingly powerful feeling  that there is only ever “now”. 

Other people lose their sense of having a conscience, they start to feel like inanimate objects. Makes it really unsettling to maintain small talk when your mind isn’t focused on the conversation topic at all. 

It’s isolating, when I find existence so bizzare, but everyone around me carries on with life as if it’s not bizzare. 

If I experience disassociation mid conversation, I can’t just say “I feel weird” to the other person. Especially when I work at checkouts at the supermarket lol. 

I become unintentionally aware of my body. 

My eyes, and how what I see is actually an image inside my head, not an image outside of my body like it appears to be. 

Also my movement. How simple it is, that a thought can move my limbs and facial expressions. 

The concept of having thoughts starts to become disorientating. It feels like they’re almost physical. It feels like they’re in the room with me. I mean this literally not figuratively. When I disassociate, it wouldn’t surprise me if someone could read my mind, my thoughts feel that physically there. 

Sounds can become distorted. I’m gonna try hard to explain what that means. So, as you know, in music, certain notes in a song portray certain emotions. For me mundane sounds, like cars driving by or the dishes being put away, will start to sound emotionally charged. And can sound morbid and disturbing. 

Personality goes out the window. I become aware of how everyone has an ego. What does it mean to act out of character when I created mine in the first place? Personality doesn’t physically exist so is that not reason enough it’s an illusion. 

I have the sensation of being an observer. I’m the observer of my thoughts not the creator. I’m the observer of my bodies sensations. I’m not my body. My body carries in when I die. I’m the awareness. Not my personality or memories. 

I don’t know if I’m making sense lmao but anyway.

I think the fact i was already interested in science, space and philosophy has meant, when I started disassociating and experiencing these ideas first hand (eg. time being man made or conscience being an illusion), I start obsessively thinking about existence. 

It’s a benefit in the fact I’m no longer as phased by day to day stresses like work/bills, friend drama and family deaths. As they seem so irrelevant in the big scheme of things. (I don’t intend that to be a depressing outlook.)

The best thing I’ve taken from it, is that I am the universe observing itself for no reason at all. Might as well try enjoy it. "
"I am feeling it right now. I know I should reach out but as long as I am the only one who knows, I can't hurt anyone else and it isn't real. Lending a voice and name to it means I have to deal with it."
"I have ADHD which is the only thing diagnosed, I don’t have a previous partner however I come from a town where cheating was regular however I moved. Thank you for helping me I appreciate every word "
I think you’re overwhelmed by your situation. My ex was Chinese and she had a bad relationship with her parents. She moved out on her own in her own apartment and felt way better about her situation.
"IN ALL SERIOUSNESS ahem... when I get up very late or it's a cloudy day from dawn to dusk, I lose my sense of synchronicity with time and it sucks
.. but time and a nights sleep helps ground you again."
"It feels like a tight gripping, or a stormy sea, in my chest (heart) and stomach.  
I wish I could either tell her off and get her to leave me alone, or feel absolutely nothing at all when she's nearby"
"It's natural if you aren't adept with math, science, or musical instruments yet. The benefit comes from learning, from practicing and getting better over time. You can also try learning a new language."
"LOL you mean ""good lass"" ;) I am female. You're welcome all the same. It is my pleasure to help people here because I have been there, done that, got a T-shirt, mug, and a poster. Keep your head up ok?"
"Oh I miss coffee. Every time I see it or smell it I get a craving. I wake up around that time every day too, would love so much to have a nice coffee, but I think it contributes too much to anxiety. :("
"Oh yeah, no it definitely gets better. With help and by making a conscious effort to change the way I think. Getting the diagnosis wasn't the end-all to my life. It was the start of me getting better. "
"Ok, so this has been going for quite a while I see.

When you say your parents fight, do you mean psychically, verbally, or both?

Do you think that there are other factors contributing to this at all?"
Oof. TBH I personally wouldn't risk it. I'm not a professional but it might make getting used to the drug harder and mess shit up. I think getting the prescription and not skipping at all is worth it.
"Please, don't do this to the other person...if you feel like leaving, don't make them live a lie - they will need time to heal, the earlier they start, the better.

Do you have any friends in the area?"
"This is the one thing I will ever quote Kanye on:

""Money isn't everything. Not having it is.""

Yes, money can't make you happy, but the absence of money is damn near guaranteed to make your life hell."
Yes I understand that. I've dealt with parents criticizing my decisions as well. And not just parents but other people as well. I'm just trying to encourage him to do what he wants in life. That's all.
"Yes. I hum in my mind- the alphabet song. I sing it under my breath if it gets worse and I driven to a parking lot and scream in my vehicle when it gets too bad. 

It’s a distracting coping mechanism"
"You need to go educate yourself more on mental health. She's not giving you a hard time, she's having a hard time! 
Love and support your child you chose to bring her into the world, you owe it to her "
Your obvious intelligence is clear. I think ultimately you can think your way through it.i cannot compare to you by any means so I cannot presume to know anything at all. I hope you find the strength.
"I told my mom everything. It went well. She’s calling a doctor tomorrow and I’m gonna get checked out I guess. I wouldn’t have ever been able to do this without you or the others here, thank you. Her heart broke a little when I told her about my suicidal thoughts, I seen it shatter. I’m kind of numb and emotionless at the moment. No excitement or anger or sadness, nothing. I think I’m going to sleep, I’ll talk to some of you again tomorrow. "
"I understand how you feel. I procrastinate a lot during my work and I tend to goof off on youtube, which has become a psychological addiction more me in a sense. However, when I do creative stuff, which for me is crafting a DnD campaign, I feel much better. You might want to take drawing supplies into the office with you. Another thing you could do is listen to a podcast, they are lengthy and generally have quality entertainment/ interesting education. "
I’d like to know as well. my mental state is a hell of a mess and I’ve been thinking about getting a massage but still trying to convince myself into it (been trying for at least two years now ������ I keep judging myself saying it’s too high maintenance don’t do it be humble you don’t have to be fancy stuff of that nature) And if I ever do go now I’m wondering if they’d be able to tell by the sensations in my body or some shit
"Normally, the first couple of sessions are ""getting to know you"" sessions where the therapist will ask some background questions and learn more about your anxiety and depression. Be as honest as you can but also know that it's okay to say ""I don't feel comfortable talking about that yet."" Also, if you feel like you aren't clicking with your therapist, find another one. It's super important for the two of you to be a good fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck!!"
"Not at all. My former husband struggled with this problem. Be honest with the people you know and work on your problems. Be brave. The physical feelings of anxiety that you have are real, but they are also temporary. Perhaps being honest with your friends/family is the kind of activity I was talking about (a.k.a. standing on a park bench). Expose yourself to these kinds of stressful situations. You'll notice you don't die from it. Things can get better."
"Sad truth here but it’s the only thing that can honestly set you free...

We all have battles we have to overcome. Our battle is no different it just comes in different forms, but we all have to overcome something to become truly free.

So ready for the truth? You will never be able to stop having these feelings. I know it sounds horrible now but soon you will be free and I don’t want to put a lot of personal info on reddit so I’m going to pm you "
"I have anxiety with depression also, and I know the feeling that they’re going through, but using those things as an excuse is not the way it works. Sometimes I let out heavy sighs but it’s because I’ve got tightness in my chest from whatever anxiety is bothering me at the time, but that’s easily explainable. 

Anxiety and/or depression does not mean that it’s okay to treat other people as if they’re a burden, especially if they’re trying to go out of their way to hang out or talk! If it’s getting to be too much for you to keep trying, I would let them know that you’re there for them if they want to hang out or talk, and then just go about your business. That’s really all you can do. "
"I have a close family member with BPD and whereas it hasn’t always been an easy relationship, it’s one of the most important relationships I have. She’s been through some very dark and difficult times but I think she’s learnt a lot over the years and she’s much more even tempered now. She’s one of the kindest, most honest, loving and loyal people I know. Because of her I always have a soft spot for people with BPD - I care about them and I feel for them. The way the world treats people with BPD is bad, but people with BPD aren’t bad people (they often do things they regret, but none of us are our behaviours; we’re all so much more and we all do things we aren’t proud of) . It must be incredibly difficult to go through this world feeling so much and hurting in the ways that people with BPD do. It must be extra hard when you face the stigma of something that is such a part of your experience but it doesn’t define who you are. People with BPD often have excellent people reading skills - they can smell dodgy people a mile off because their senses are more finely tuned than people who don’t have BPD. At the end of the day, you are you - don’t apologise for who you are. Take care friend x"
"I dont have any answers to help you specifically, more so words of encouragement. Having been there, and slipping now and again myself. Know that you aren't alone, this is not the end of it for you and things will be okay even if it doesnt seem like it or anywhere close. I'm currently in my second year, and living more alone than I was freshman year. Therapists never seemed to help, and meds aren't a cure all. One thing that helped me a lot was going to the gym, getting blood flowing, getting out of my room helped. Another thing I turned to was watching ASMR videos, they aren't everyone's cup of tea but I find them relaxing and an escape from the world. But most importantly. Taking back control of your mind is such an easy thing, but also tremendously hard. I see it as like, you can bite your finger off with the force of biting a carrot right? But your mind wont let you. It's very hard to get out of the rut, and to take back your mind. Dont lose touch with those that do bring you happiness. Even if it's a few texts a week, a daily call, or skyping, anything to keep the human contact. If you are in a place, or get to one where you can get a therapy dog or cat, I truly thing that would help to. Just remember, however low you feel however scared you get, no matter how much it hurts, just remember to be strong. Remember you are strong, and you own your mind. Dont be afraid to reach out for help. And dont be afraid to accept help when needed. You are not alone. "
"Lol I feel this and I'm in my late 20s. I used to think people a year or two older than me were so much wiser and together and more human than those my age and younger because they lived in a world that was totally different and all the drama had subsided. The younger you are, the more you feel the age differences because you're in a period of rapid change and growth, and it's so obvious behind and before you.

Occasionally I look at people in their 30s or people who've had children or careers like they're ""real adults"" and I'm still somehow a kid because my experiences have been different than theirs for a number of reasons. If I let it, it can drive me fucking nuts- makes me irritable and hate everyone just for having the audacity to be themselves. But the more I grow, the more I realize that high school never really ends- there is drama and immaturity everywhere you go. It just looks different. However, you are responsible for you. You make the decision to be empathetic and compassionate and inclusive. You can do that at any age. Maturity isn't a number.

With that in mind, I find it easier to be friends with people older than myself or whose lives are different (not better) than mine, without feeling like I'm less than and without wishing I was them. I spent a lot of time wishing my years away when I was in my teens and now I'm starting to see how silly that is. I also felt I never fit in with my peers because my childhood experiences had made me ""grow up"" a little quicker than others. I wanted so badly to be around people who were in a similar place as I was, and that was often found in those older than me. Makes me think of that song When by Dodie, ""Oh it will be over, and I'll still be asking when."" 

It's incredibly easy to look down on the people we've been before, or to be discontented with where we are because we wish we were somewhere else. Don't forget that everyone is on their own path, going through their own private shit that you don't know about, and growing at different rates. The best thing you can do when you're irritated with someone's immaturity is to set the example of what is right and good. Not in a pretentious way, but with the understanding that everyone is doing their best where they're at. You're not better than they are, just as someone older isn't better than you. Be the one who helps them up. And if your 20+ year old friends dismiss you or don't value you because you're younger than they are, they aren't that mature.

And for heaven's sake, don't hate yourself for things that are beyond your control. This is your only chance to be 19 so do it the best you can. You're right where you're supposed to be and that's enough.

Sorry this is long. I've been thinking a lot about it lately."
"&gt; I was desperate for help and didn’t know where else to go. 

How often have you been desperate for help and ended up in the ER?  What country?  Yes, it all has a bearing on how you were treated. "
"&gt; It was NOT poor communication that sunk the ship, she went looking for a better man because you were not a leader

You should leave this man alone, because this kind of foolishness is not helpful. "
"&lt;3 I hear you on that...I am afraid if my hubby finds out that I am just a crazy person who is obsessed with fire, he might leave me and take the kids. Keep your head up...I am hugging you virtually!"
:/ but I want to know if there's something wrong with me. I mean sure I don't want meds and I am quite happy about my life how it is right now. But I want to know everything there is to learn about me.
Definitely see a GI but I have the same thing often and would self medicate with cannabis (which just made it worse in the long run) until I got a prescription for ondansetron. Hope you get relief soon!
"I feel like I have been in a rut for years since I am basically a determisnist who deosn't believe in free will. I pretty much get caught up by the futility of it all too.

Stoicism might be a good one?"
I feel like I’m having a similar experience and it’s only day two of a half dose. I like being sleepy though so it’s all good. Thank you for being the only one here to give me some speck of hope.
"I find it hard to even explain accurately, sometimes - that is ok. Other times there are things I don't want to admit or talk about with certain people - that is ok as long as I am not isolating myself."
I have no idea what any of that means. But the only way you'll ever get better is if you are 100 percent completely honest with a doctor. You have to tell them everything. Otherwise they can't help you.
"I'd say you should just try to focus on something else for the time being. Focus on a hobby of yours, or try to find some new music to listen to. It sucks waiting months for something your anticipating."
I'm beginning to learn to trust the process. When people used to say that to me I would get pissed off but now I'm starting to understand exactly what that means. I really appreciate your kind words. :)
"I'm sorry for what you have gone through.  I hope you can find a way to say goodbye in your own way, like go somewhere or watch something or whatever that you did with your friend. I'm here if you need."
"I’m on fluoxetine (Prozac) and I experience the vivid dreams thing. I also experience the forgetfulness thing, but I attribute that to my depression rather than being a side effect of the medication. "
Just let them know you are there for them and that you care. That’s what I need from people when I isolate. Tell them you’ll be there when they’re ready to talk and that you won’t bail on them.
Parents who censor their children should not have children. This is an abusive behavior. Love can't make up for it. I don't think people realize how often parents ruin their children for the fuck of it.
"Seroquel (quetiapine). It was originally an antipsychotic but is commonly prescribed off label for all sorts of things, and in my case was very helpful with obsessive thoughts of suicide and self harm. "
Seroquel is a good combination with Neurontin. At least that's what I've been told by doctors in the past. The best thing about Seroquel is that it helps you get to sleep faster if you take it at night.
"Thank you!! When I got my tattoo, I started tearing up because I felt like I came a long way. I’m so proud of myself. You’re going to looove your tat! I hope things are going well for you as well:-)"
Who around me? Here's the assumptions I was talking about. Do you think everyone has people around them who would notice if they're gone? Not every problem has a solution. Some problems can't be solved.
"With so many chiming in on this issue- reassuring. I have a difficult time with a bit of body dysmorphia. 
But increased circulation and decreased microbial counts from shower and teeth brushing... hmmm"
"Yeah, that’s what I figured, hence why I’ve been purposefully avoiding acting like this. I was mostly asking how to permanently avoid wanting to hurt others, but I understand you seeing me that way."
"Are you crying because you’re utterly depressed in general? Like would you feel this way even if you weren’t in grad school, but maybe school is making it worse? If you’ve tried several therapists and don’t feel like it’s working for you, maybe you can try something else. Have you been to a psychiatrist? They could accurately diagnose you and perhaps actually pinpointing what’s going on will give you more answers on how to work through this. "
"Huh. Then I would ask them if they'd be willing to make an exception for an ESA and ask them if there's a form they'd like you to fill out, or if they'd accept a doctors note by itself. Usually property management companies will have you fill out a ""reasonable accommodation request"" form and the request would be, medical need for an animal. You and your doctor fill out the form and the landlord or company can only deny it on very rare and specific cases."
I relate 100% you’re not alone. I hate driving late at night anywhere due to fear of breaking down/getting stuck/ something happening to my car even though my car is new and has no problems whatsoever. I have a really irrational fear too of getting lost in an area without reception/not being able to find my way back. I cannot drive late at night if I don’t know exactly where I’m going I need to know my way around or my anxiety is through the roof.
"I’m sorry to intrude, but you were in the same shoes as my bf as well? If this topic makes you uncomfortable, please ignore my question. 

I believe that deep down I can forgive him but I’m afraid that he’ll hurt me again. He sounds deeply regretful and I’ll probably forgive him and give him a second chance when I’m ready. 

I’m just afraid that people or friends who know about our situation will think that I am stupid for taking him back... "
"Mental health, like physical health is a two-way street. You need to work WITH the doctor and therapist. If something works on the mental issues but causes bodily problems, tell the doctor and work with them on finding something that works on the mental issues and doesn't cause the bodily problems. Always follow up, keep a journal of your functioning and how you feel day to day. Learn your mental rhythms, see if there are patterns to your ups and downs. "
"No one here can or should try to diagnose your friend. 

If you’re worried about her, talk to her. Not in an “I think you have X disorder” way, but maybe “I’ve noticed XYZ and I’m concerned for you, have you mentioned this to your doctor/therapist?” It may be that she already has, and that they’re things she’s working on. If not, she may be grateful for your outside perspective as long as it comes from a place of non-judgmental caring. "
"BPD is a set of learnt reactions, you have learned to react in a negative way.

For example you might ask me to go to a party and I might say I can't go, something has come up. You could feel that I am abandoning you so you might not talk to me or act cold. However something really has come up.

A person with BPD does not think about the other possibilities. It is black and white thinking. 

So ask yourself this question, do other people think about killing their boss, or the guy who tried to run them off the road?

To beat BPD you need to read about BPD scenarios like the one above so you can see the negative logic and realise hey I do the same thing. Then you need to unlearn the behaviour.

"In my opinion, as someone not in the field (so take it as a grain of salt, but I’ve seriously considered doing both), I know I would have a significantly more difficult time working in a shelter than in a rescue. Shelters seem entirely different, and rescues seem difficult enough as they are. I really admire people who do either; I know I would not be able to handle it for the sake of my mental health, at least for the time being. Maybe consider scaling back, doing something else, or working in a different shelter or rescue or something else related if you want to stay in that field? There are other ways to work with animals that are less emotionally draining, if that’s what you’d like to keep doing"
"No, fuck that. I’m more than likely going to be diagnosed with ADHD at my evaluation next week. I have also been suffering from anxiety and depression so that could be the case with me as well. It is ABSOLUTELY NOT YOUR FAULT. Read that sentence again. You are not at fault for this, NO ONE is. It is your genes. Don’t let her get into your head. 

As for some things to relieve your mental anguish, I have personally found that eating healthy and running/exercising are extremely therapeutic and release a lot of physical and mental tension. 

Again, it is not your fault. I’m sorry your mom can’t see that, but we all can. Sending lots of love and good vibes your way! Praying for your recovery, friend. "
"I'm not suggesting you turn around your life on a dime. And I'm not saying what you experience is like what I do. This isn't an ""if I can do it, you can do it"" pep talk. But I have known people with serious mental health problems, and they have gotten better by getting help.

I am not asking you to put effort into anything. I am just suggesting you NOT put effort into ending your life. Not yet, at least.

If you suffered abuse when younger there's a very good chance that it is related to this. There are people and techniques and yes, medications that can help.

All I ask is that you at least try to get help before you give up. If you had a severe physical illness you would, and this is not different.

Also, again, please PM me any time if you want to talk. I may be a stranger but we are all connected. And some of my best friends were ""strangers"" I met online. One is a person who is arguably my best friend and I have never seen her face nor heard her voice."
"Have you been diagnosed with any sort of behavioural disorders or learning disabilities? This is what I’d be like if I was never put on ADHD medication. Who knows, there might be a simple explanation! "
Have you ever been to therapy? A good therapist can help you work on your social skills as well as coping skills for your anxiety. I have seen some amazing results with people with Asperger's and Autism.
"I can't say for sure how good it is, but I found a good therapist on psychologytoday.com. They have reviews, experience, expertise, etc.

You could also ask for a referral from your general practitioner."

I remember when i were once there.  I was able to help my self but depression does suck a-lot lost a ex gf who was a officer she took her life also. It helps to listen to people its goes such a long way.

You need to stay productive. And you need to force yourself to get out of the house. Otherwise your depression is just going to keep getting worse. Stay busy. It'll help take your mind off your problems.

That's so great to hear and I really appreciate you following up - I remember everyone I talk to on here so it's really good for me to hear a success story. I know you've still got a long path ahead of you, just like all of us, but taking such huge positive steps forward in such a short amount of time is a rare thing. Hope things continue to get better for you and that this treatment plan is a springboard back to a happy life - good luck with everything!"
"Are you seeing anyone for your depression? A doctors note could help here. I would talk to your professors and find out what can be done before assuming you need to drop the whole semester. Your teachers want you to succeed and though some may be more understanding than others, most will want to help you work through it. 

There is also the option of trying to take Incompletes for the courses if you feel you need to focus on your mental health right now. "
"I give this advice a lot, but go to the gym. Working out is an amazing coping method. It'll give you something productive to do. And it'll get you out of the house. You might even meet new people there also. You never know. Exercising is a great way to release built of stress and frustration also. And you'll start feeling better about yourself as well. Working out gets me out of bed. And it's helped me with my depression over the past several months also."
"I work with many people who are also on your path of feeling good again. Remember being sober is a double edged sword. Yes you will feel good again. Yes there will be times you feel so bad you want to drink again. But if you deal with your emotions properly you NEVER have to drink again. Therapy, support groups and good friends as well as keeping busy and exercise. There are many like you that have discovered a new self by examining thoughts and emotions."
"Used to be super anti-meds. Studied all the anti stuff abs refused for years until I finally gave in. And I’ll tell you what, It’s way better than fighting a fight you’ll never win. 

The meds balance your brain chems to the point you’re able to think clearly enough about yourself and your issues thereby giving you the best chance you’ve had at figuring things out. 

For a lot of folks meds aren’t forever. They are merely a tool used to help. "
"adhd most commonly occurs with depression and anxiety, chances are if you’ve been diagnosed with adhd, you have a very good chance of being diagnosed with depression. that being said, it’s not your fault. you didn’t choose to have adhd. you didn’t choose to have depression. yes depression can form because of adhd, but it’s not your fault unless you decided one day to have clinical depression. of course it’s not your fault!!! keep this in mind."
"If you're in the US, the process would likely be the same for either, assuming the clinic has a psychiatrist. If not, and you're looking to see a general doctor, they'll probably listen to your symptoms, and possibly prescribe a short term medication for you if they feel it's really necessary. The first general practice doctor I told about my anxiety gave me a benzo prescription that was meant to last a week or so, and referred me to a psychiatrist.

Otherwise, there's usually an intake evaluation with a nurse or therapist where they ask you a bunch of questions and possibly refill any meds you're currently taking, then on your next visit you'd see the psychiatrist. That's always how it's been ime anyway.

"Samaritans is only a charity but they can offer an informal space for you to talk and be listened to, it may tide you over until you can find a capable GP. They might be enough to get you through this bad day; you can call, email or even visit in person if you have a branch nearby. Sometimes getting help can just be a matter of finding the right person to understand your needs, and it can take some time and a few tries to find them, so don't be disheartened if you don't find them straight away.

Mind are another charity that may be able to help direct you to services available in your region.

"Sorry, again that's by state too it seems. Some states require you to work at least a little and some don't. Also, I'm not sure but medicaid behavioral health insurance may be different as many private insurance companies don't really have a behavioral health coverage or at least a strong one. Insurance isn't my specialty. 

As for your analogy, I'd say keep reaching out for help like you are here. Each attempt is a jab into that wall. It's your choice. Keep letting the water fill up and do nothing until it completely consumes you...or starting banging against the wall, making dents/holes in it to let the water out, and in turn, letting other people know to try and do the same from the outside of the wall."
"Thank you so much. 

Honestly, I just have to dig deep and remind myself why I want to (*NEED* to) keep going: I don’t want to end up like I was in the past; I don’t want to make those same bad decisions; I want to be able to move out of my house and away from the people that are causing me the most emotional damage.... no one else can do this for me but me. Only I can take me to where I need to go. Only I can win this battle and giving up isn’t an option if I want to survive and thrive. That’s what keeps me going. 

Other than that... exercise helps. I work out 3-5x a week... I got rid of all my social media apps; I don’t watch TV (or if I do maybe like 2 hours per month) and instead try to keep myself busy with productive activities: reading; teaching myself a new subject; going on hikes.... 

Ohh CBD has also been a godsend... I swear by it and highly HIGHLY recommend it. And acupuncture has been another amazing addition to managing my stress! "
"you're talking about /r/BPD?  

You're not your diagnosis. You're you. Your diagnosis is a label applied to you. There's a lot more to you than that. 

Take from it whatever is useful, and disregard whatever is not. 

You can pick it up and put it down at will. Its not stuck to you (or at least, doesnt have to be). It can be a signpost and a way to move forward; and that is not a bad thing in itself (having a sense of direction?)

I think the thing with BPD is - and this may not apply to you - for some people it can be more useful to look at the DSMV (the psychiatry diagnostics bible) 'personality disorders' as a continuum. For some people, it works better to flick across, back and forth through the different categories, and not get too hung up on one. 

PDs used to be considered relatively stable. The thinking now is that people can shift them. Its not necessarily permanent, and shouldnt be taken as an indication of who you are. 

Sorry this got you down. "
"I raised a kitten since she was 2 and a half months old and she passed away three weeks ago, at almost 13. I completely understand how you feel when you say that your cat was way more than a pet. For people like us, they become an anchor, a safe place, someone that we can love and that will love us in return, free of judgement, free of all the stress that comes with dealing with other humans, which can be overwhelming. They're calming and soothing, especially cats. Mine would always lay by my chest whenever I was having a panic attack. I stopped self-harming because I couldn't stand doing it while she was present and she followed me everywhere. It's a special bond that we can't have with other humans, simple as that. 

Your campaign is not stupid and anyone saying ""it's just a pet"" simply doesn't get it. They're most likely not mentally ill, they've never had that kind of bond and they lack the empathy to see your side. And that's on them, not on you.

Have you tried advertising the campaign in groups that deal specifically with mental health and pets? Maybe on facebook and such? Maybe someone can help you get a sphynx kitten or help boost the campaign. I hope things get better and that you get your kitten. "
"It really depends on where your problem lies.

Issues with motivation can come from many directions. Could be requested to your energy levels, clue be related to depression, maybe it's just time for a short vacation and your brain needs some rest. Maybe you're not getting enough exercise, maybe you're writing too much, maybe you don't have enough downtime and fun, maybe there's a specific nutrient or vitamin that you're not getting enough of. Maybe something completely different?

Maybe you have an issue with executive functioning (common in people with depression, amongst others)?

Motivation is a very broad and high level concept. Can you try the following for me?

The next time you're procrastinating, or feeling unmotivated to do what you want/need to do. Write down the following questions: ""what is stopping me from doing what I need/want to do right now?""

Then just write down literally anything and everything that pops up in your head for 5 minutes. You probably know what you need or in what direction you need to start looking more deeply, it's just that sometimes your brain needs to get a little push in the right direction to reveal the answer that's already inside.

Let me know how it goes, good luck!"
"It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression and enthusiasm won't fix it (contrary to what people think). Your feelings are real and any doctor who dismisses them isn't doing their job. I highly recommend seeing a therapist but know that you might not find one right away that you like and that it's a collaboration. You have to work with the therapist to address the issues. 

I hope you are hearing it when people tell you this is temporary though. It truly is. It'll take work to get out of but it'll happen. I know it's so hard to hear that when you're in it but you won't feel like this forever.

Two things that really helped me with my anxiety and depression:

1. Lost Connections by Johann Hari. I actually listened to the audiobook of this on a road trip and it changed my life. Depression isn't just a problem with our brain but with our environment. We just have these dumb animal brains and we need to not dismiss what they need to function properly. When we don't give them what they need, they start signalling (with depression and anxiety) to us that something is wrong.
2. Meditation. I learned with the free trial of Headspace. It has allowed me to have more control over my thoughts but it takes practice and repetition.

I'm also really proud of an instagram I just started called @ouranimalbrains to talk about depression and anxiety. I don't make money off of it or anything but if you're interested, check it out.

I hope you feel better!"
"Oh, internet.  You can find articles to prove any point you want.  Here are three articles on why physical exercise is bad for you:

Every treatment, and, I dare say, ""healthy activity"" has its risks, and the articles you posted highlighted some of them associated with mindfulness (though I'm taking the first and last articles with a grain of salt since they were not written by a medical professionals).  I hope anyone who is reading what you have to say about mindfulness is also taking what you say with a grain of salt.  I am a licensed counselor who has done extensive research on empirically based treatments, and mindfulness-based theories are found to be the most effective, again and again. Furthermore, I have seen too many of my clients (most of them with anxiety related diagnoses) benefit from mindfulness practices to discount it as ""at best, a waste of time.""  Like others have said, it takes a lot of practice, and you must practice when relaxed.  With the guidance of a professional, the risks these articles talk about can be mitigated.  It is worth a try.  Don't let ""fat_dumbass""'s post deter you from trying something that could be very effective for you, with practice.

"I am so sorry that you went through this, it must've been awful. I really hope you're in a better place now, thank you for sharing this with me, it really means a lot. I'm in the UK so I'm not sure what ages those grades are but I'm guessing your bullying started at age 11/12? Is that about right? For me I was at school with the same girls from ages 7-17, we were always friends up until I was 12, one of the girls decided she didn't like me anymore and turned everyone against me, I was ostracised overnight and my whole world changed, I turned from being a happy child that loved school to a child that too scared to have an opinion in case it meant another person would turn on me. I was never left alone to make new friends, it was like everywhere I went they followed making life difficult for me, I couldn't do anything without being mocked, it was pretty brutal, but I imagine what you experienced was much worse than this. I dropped out of 6th form early because the main girl was still talking about me at even that point and I realised how miserable I'd been all along and thought 'yeah fuck this I'm out' (amongst a few other reasons). 

I totally feel you on your mum not supporting you, when I was sent to secondary school there were about 8 classes I could've gone into, I was sent into a class with her, I told my mum and she did nothing, it meant that even at my new school I had no chance. I feel like it's haunted me ever since, I dream about them all of the time, I feel like I have no idea who I am because I was too scared to try anything, no idea of what career I'd like, no social media accounts, and probably worst of all I'm too scared to succeed at anything in case my name ends up online and they find it and start another hate campaign - I know that sounds so ridiculous, i doubt they even think about me, but the fear is so real. On top of that knowing that I've made other people potentially feel this way haunts the fuck out of me. Depression is a mother fucker."
"I can only speak to my experience working in the field in the U.S. so if you're in another country, the way the mental health system works may be substantially different.  


Here, a crisis center's primary responsibility is to admit folks to inpatient hospital stays only if they present as a danger to themselves or others.  Sometimes even severe psychosis isn't enough for getting admitted if there is no real suicidal or homicidal ideation. 


There are many different levels of care and finding the right one for you is very important.  Good therapy should focus on helping you develop a natural support system of individuals in your life you can turn to for assistance when experiencing high levels of depression/anxiety.  Essentially, the goal of an ethical therapist is to get you to a space where you don't need them anymore as soon possible by helping you develop your own coping skills and building a solid support system.  

There are higher levels of care in between weekly outpatient therapy and hospitalization.  For instance, you can join a  therapy group in conjunction with your individual therapy.  If that's not enough, there are what we call Intensive Outpatient Programs.  Generally these are intensive therapy groups that meet 3-4x a week for a few hours at a time.  Higher than this is Partial Hospitalization Programs.  With this, generally every day you will be going to a psych hospital to participate in group therapy, individual therapy, training programs to help assist you.  There are also groups called DBT Groups that will look similar to intensive outpatient groups but also offer the ability to call a therapist for coaching when in need.    

The highest level is inpatient hospitalization.  This level is really only focused on putting you in an environment that will keep you safe from harming yourself or others, monitor medications, and get you just to the point where you are stable enough to not be a danger to yourself or others.  It's very matter of fact and isn't always going to feel like the most supportive or calming experience.  If you aren't actively suicidal or homicidal, they're going to kick you down and recommend a lower level of care.  


I'm not arguing with you about how it SHOULD or SHOULDN'T be.  I'm just letting you know how it is.  Do some research into the levels of care I described and see if one seems to be what you feel like you need right now.  A regular outpatient therapist should be able to facilitate a referral to one of these.  "

"Start with a general therapist. See what they might do or recommend. Medication might or might not be needed. You said you have ADHD, so get help with that, and then see about the anxiety and depression. "
Thank you so much for the kind words :) I'm in a much better place now. The silver lining about the whole situation is my friends and family realized I needed help and I no longer had to hide my problems.
"Thanks. I was just diagnosed and I am a little scared to a therapist. I suffer from pyromania and I just am so done talking about it. I am tired of thinking about it. 

Let me know if you need to chat OK?"

"Father left when I was 3 or 4 I think. My mother certainly had good intentions and always provided but was very narrow minded, judgemental. I always felt like I couldn't talk about my feelings which is why I suffered in silence until I was 18 and then finally got help for my depression and anxiety. I believe she was borderline emotionally abusive. Definitely manipulative. There was alot of yelling and intimidation growing up. I dont think of it much though"
"I get like this sometimes. Like I can be absolutely devastated, you’d think it was the end of the world or something, at the time I feel like these feeling are all consuming and are never going to end.

Less than an hour later and I feel almost normal (sometimes happy?). It’s like the crying helps release those feelings and once everything is ‘released’ I can see/feel things more clearly again.

Hate it sometimes though. Makes me feel like a fraud."
"Oh sweetheart. You are NOT a bad mom!! Can you distract her with something else for the moment until she calms down and forgets about it? I have 5 kids, and they were all 2 at one time and I can tell you, a 2 year old forgets very easily. :) Just give her something else to do, and she will be ok. And take care of yourself, Mom. :) You need to take it easy and breathe. I hope your anxiety is better now. I know how that goes...boy, do I. Lots of love to you!"
Something similar happened to a friend's little bro and he woke me up and took me to hospital bc his parents were kind of ignorant about mental illness and drugs. This kid had scholarships to ivy leagues. Sounded like he took a research chemical but whatever sparked serious mental health issues and psychosis. Call a crisis psychology place. Medicaid or whatever covers it and they can come to the house. Don't blindside her though. That can be traumatizing.
"Thanks for the info! I think it started about a year or so ago. After my ex and I broke up. His friends would always tell me how pretty I am etc. I don't think I'm the most beautiful person in the world but not terrible by societies standards. A lot of the hate I had for my body came from growing up being called fat all the time etc. Plus being severally depressed ontop of the self hatred. eventually I began to realize that I'm actually at
healthy weight. "
"It's a difficult line to tread, but given the evident need to emotionally 'push down' another in this case I'm sure the perpetrator isn't a physically intimidating or emotionally intimidating person. They're socially submissive, not naturally extrovert, nor completely introverted. Violent types are emotionally assertive, they'll try to be dominate one way or another, not passively try to 'see how someone's doing'. Then there's psychotic who'll just go off one way or another. OP's safe expressing some form of rejection, because typically submissive will try to barter on a common ground, find a 'middle position', no common ground: no field for them to play..just tell them to go away and they lose their power."
"Omg... are you me???? I relate to you SO much! THANK YOU!!! 

I too feel like I’m always viewed as the “strong one” and because of that I feel people don’t think I need the support that I do (when I do need it). It’s a catch-22 because on one hand I don’t want to (like to) be let down by others... it pains me deeply when I am, so I’ve learned to be self reliant and only depend on myself (in most cases)... but because of that I think I’ve given off the impression to those close to me that I’m strong and don’t need support (or need very little). It’s also hard for me to ask for it because I feel like I SHOULD be able to handle everything on my own. 

Thank you so much for sharing. ❤️"
"i understand.  I am just telling you, she walked out, she said she had a change of heart.  If you ever wanted to take her back and for it too work, you best bet, is to immediately move on, go no contact, improve your life, and consider her return very carefully.  I advise against it.  She has not honored her word, why should you? don't give me this disneyland marriage crap.  It was NOT poor communication that sunk the ship, she went looking for a better man because you were not a leader, she lost her attraction.  IF she comes back, its because whomever or whatever she thought she had to swing to, failed, so she'll come back until she can find another opportunity to leave you...don't believe it? you'll see. "
"Terribly sorry your family is dealing with all this.

If you and your Spouse are interested, NAMI (National Association of Mental Illness) offers educational classes for family members of those diagnosed for free. Look up your local affiliate and they will probably hold it at a nearby community center.

Finding your way as a young man with suicidal tendencies is incredibly tough nowadays, I think there is real value in doing everything YOU can to take care of yourself and be a strong male role model (which I know you are already because you care enough to be here).

Can echo what others said about being really disenfranchised after a hospital experience. It will be a fragile time when your son comes back, work to show him some level of kindness and to not treat him like a victim. That's all you can do, you can't force anything, and he needs to come to his own realizations.

"I can relate. I haven't had the greatest childhood. Had a lot of shit go down. And that likely does add to my frustration. How these people can care about such minute issues. I've seen people cry over instagram likes. I simply can't fathom how you can be that profoundly affected by points on a screen. 

I admit if people bring up details about their mundane lives I actively request that they stop. Nothing bores me more than hearing about the time you ate a biscuit. Every single deep discussion I've had was with 20 somethings. 

And are they really all trying their best? I've seen teenagers mock an Autistic girl for something as minor as laughing after someone sneezed (and that was because she was thinking about something completely different). Do you genuinely think that those people were doing their best? Actively finding excuses to be dicks to someone? 

And trust me I'm not supposed to be where I am now. All education I receive is just obvious shit to me and I desperately seek to learn something new. Unfortunately I can't go to university yet due to not having enough qualifications. I'm also held back in the dating scene. Albeit on my own accord but I'm not happy about it. I've intentionally avoided dating during teens. I'd really like to but there's a good chance that will backfire. My parents always warned me about it. Had friends who did it and they all regret it. Teenagers are simply too over-reactive to form any decent relationships with.

&amp;#x200B;"
"I guess if she is not coming to you and asking, then, yes, you risk it being an imposition. I guess the priority is trying to get her to a point where she can listen to you. I think the way to do this is to sit her down and talk about some 'safe' things you are concerned about. (By this I mean staying clear of topics that could sound accusational or get her offside). Tell her what you're observing and tell her thats worrying you, and that you want to check in with her and see how she's going with tall that. 

When you're talking, try to get her to open up about her own concerns. If you can do that, you have an opening for asking the question, ""have you thought about getting help?""

I guess she's either going to recognise where you are coming from (the behavior stuff) and get that there's a problem and you're presenting a friendly ear and an opportunity to talk - or - she wont have any idea what you're talking about and get defensive. If the former occurs, theres potential for meaningful dialogue. If the latter, not so much. 

I guess you can only do what you can. 

If she's open to talking about help, maybe be sure you know what the avenues are in your country for next steps to take to connect with support. For example appointment with GP for assessment and referral, or direct self referral to a mental health service or therapist or group or other community resource. 

Hope it goes well. Its great that you care and want to help. Will cross my fingers for you. "
"I sought help because of feeling ""numb.""  My wife always thought I was mad or upset, but I couldn't explain that I didn't feel anything, at all.  I just went through my day, unable to experience joy and really feeling nothing but empty.  I couldn't find energy or motivation to do anything other that sit and mindlessly read Reddit.  Even my video games, which I used to enjoy, had begun to feel like just more work that wasn't worth the effort.  

I was diagnosed with depression, and am taking meds as well as seeing a therapist.  It's been around 3 months, and life is extremely better for me, now.  You mention childhood trauma - I was told that severe trauma can cause your brain to adapt so it can survive.  As a result, my brain was not processing serotonin, dopamine, etc, correctly.  The meds I take are rewiring my brain to correctly receive these chemicals again, and I may be able to stop taking them after a year.  The meds do not add any additional chemicals to make me happy; they only delay the re-uptake of those chemicals long enough for my brain to use them.  My ongoing therapy visits are helping me deal with my own trauma to help keep it all from happening again, since it, and my resultant distorted world view, are the root cause.

I know I may be reading my own story onto yours, but I would seek medical help if I were you.  It sounds like you have an illness, and it's not imaginary.  I can attest that it is treatable, and that it is worth it to seek help."
"With no knowledge of the massive complexity of you as a person and your circumstances, strangers can only offer pity (unhelpful) and their advice (hit and miss). I'll give it a go as it would help to clarify my own thoughts after a similar situation in my own life.

According to psychologist Victor Frankl there are three sources of meaning: achievement, new experience (includes learning), and self-transcendence, such as (in his account) facing unavoidable suffering with dignity. If the suffering is avoidable, then it means to remove the source.

Ask yourself if you are obtaining any number of these in your current circumstances. Menial work is poison, and if you find yourself severely depressed from it, you need to activate your fight-or-flight mechanism and put it into productive use below.

Look into these and disregard any as you please:

- meditation (absolute foundation. Start simple, move slowly towards extreme)
- yoga (Hatha, Raja etc.)
- journalling (use questions from any source you enjoy)
- books on habits
- personality psychology
- Dream journal (Carl Jung)
- books &amp; articles on self-reliance
- human potential movement
- non-fiction in general (read what you enjoy)
- skills/courses 
- health - diet, exercise
- plan to end addictions of all kinds (sugar, TV...)

Regardless of how hard you work, your life will still suck for at least a year, because it does for everyone. Personal meaning production provides the wind for your sails in the meantime."
"Lots of useful feedback on this thread so will just echo what others have said.

Be there for your friend. Don't pressure them to do stuff, don't take it personally if they push you away (usually comes from a lack of self worth), and offer to do things like sit quietly in the corner with a book so they can benefit from your presence without feeling obligated to do anything.

If they are open to the idea of going out and doing stuff (even little things like a walk around the block) then offer gentle encouragement for that - don't put too much emphasis on the importance of it. You want to create an easy path to do these things without making it seem like a big deal.

Avoid telling them what they need to do to get better. Just suggest positive things and see how they react, then take it from there. Be as understanding as you can and be prepared to have bottomless patience if you think you can manage it. It's a very tough climb to get out of something like this. Keep yourself out of it - don't remind them about how much you're sacrificing etc. You seem like a very good, selfless friend so I don't think this will be too much of an issue for you, based on how you've approached this.

The new job sounds positive - do what you can to keep them going to work every day. Could be that this is an adjustment period as they get used to working again. Get them over that hump and hopefully the job will help pull them out of this.

Finally, if things are looking really dicey, get them hospitalised. No matter what financial situation it puts them in, at least they'll still be in that situation. All of that stuff can be worked out. A life of debt is always better than the alternative.

Hope both you and your friend are okay. Your friend is lucky to have someone like you in their life. Make sure you look after yourself as well. Some therapy might be good for you so you can keep your strength up and have somewhere to unload and recharge your batteries. Wishing you both all the best."
I feel the same way about things /finding a passion. I get bored easily. Sometimes it’s just easier to lay around than to force yourself to try something just “because” in a way. You’re not alone.
I had side effects the first week or so. The first few days made me feel like an utter zombie about 40 mins after taking it then it was just a bit of nausea but after that not a whole lot of difference...
I just think that parents who live with adult children have to have a great deal of patience and understanding.   My sister is going through something like this with her almost 30 year old toddler now. ; )
"I prefer not to risk it. Even the small amount of caffeine in decaf can be enough to get me back on the hook. I have pretty bad addiction issues as well so I stay 100% sober. Sadly, that includes caffeine."
"I use seroquel, had an ED. Still have anxiety, MDD and maybe BPD and it has pretty much saved my life. 

Downside is that it will make you gain weight like crazy. Which was a good thing for me at the time."
"I was dx’d as bipolar when I told them I’d been dx’d as ADHD years ago. 

They don’t want to give us ADHD meds is all. They want to give us non scheduled drugs that can give us Tardive Dyskinesia. "
"I'm so terribly sorry to hear that. It's important to try and get professional help, it can be useful.

Also, try and find things that make you happy. Really put a decent amount of effort in, it's worth it"
"It does feel very lonely, thank you for that. Thank your friend for me too, It looks like she's pouring a lot of herself for this. This video gave me a breath of life, this has been such a bad week for me."
"Jesus, can’t people like you ever stay on point or is it always about sexism? Ffs. 

Offer some help or move on. Someone is having a hard time and your initial reaction is to correct them on vocabulary? "

Unfortunately not. I live in Germany.

But, maybe I should try your approach and tell them that I feel unable to function.

Not sure if any of these are in your area, but free/sliding scale clinics are the only option I can think of aside from medicaid."
i went through a similar thing. The part that sucks is having to explain to coworkers why you were out. I eventually quit my job and took a position w/ remote at a smaller company and have been very happy.
"Getting sleep is important.  Try to find something to wind down with as part of a bedtime routine.  Like maybe listen to some music, have a hot shower, then crawl into bed after that.  And when in bed, don't worry about not getting enough sleep or worry about the day, instead just close your eyes and visualize your body getting it's needed rest while you rest your eyes.  All that time rolling around in bed isn't a complete waste.

"My story is similar to yours, I talked to a teacher and they told a counselor at school last year. They made me go to a professional counselor but I felt worse.  I dropped counseling all together saying I was better, than attempted suicide again. I have felt better for a while, but now I feel worse than before. My grades are dropping and hurting my GPA. I feel like crap and don't want to deal with my parents again, they are a struggle. I just feel so lost. "
"There are ALWAYS going to be people who have it ""worse off"" than you do, but that does NOT invalidate your feelings at all. What you feel is not only real but VERY valid and worthy of help and attention. I used to compare myself to everyone too and felt exactly how you do...that I wasn't worthy maybe of help because there are people suffering worse than I am. Well, you are suffering, and that is ALL you need to know. Good luck and I hope you feel better. :)"
"This is a completely normal feeling. After struggling with mental issues for so long, you forget who you are because that darkness and anxiety consumes you. You just forget who youre supposed to be. Combine that with that time being a very volatile, vital time of a person life, where you do begin to grow mature and change, it 100% feels like that person you were was someone completely different, and it makes it hard to figure out who you're supposed to be. "
"This is all really interesting. I’ve always felt like this in certain stores. Home Depot is the worst. The massive space, the lighting. I can’t go into one. But it’s always been that way for me. I was only in partial inpatient hospitalization and it was in a small quiet town in VT, so the stimulus was all from nature. It was hard to go back to the city after 3 weeks of that. Anyway, I’m bipolar ii with PTSD. 

I hope you’re all doing better now :)"
"He might not click with you person to person,  might not care about you (I'm just giving out thoughts), is frustrated with his work,  has home life problems,  or not feel motivated to help you if you seem like you don't want to help yourself.  

I dunno,  I just rambled off ideas if what could cause a person to seem cold or out of touch.  :)

I don't think its you though, causing this, I mean.  

I would suggest maybe asking him?  ""Hey,  you seem like we don't jive very well,  do you think I would be better suited finding another therapist?  I don't feel like I can talk to you."" Etc etc, or something along those lines. ? 

Good luck,  finding a great therapist us like finding the right drug combination.  :) "
"Me neither. I'm a perfectionist as well who also suffers from chronic OCD. I also struggle with other mental disorders too. After that brief period of happiness ends, I feel even worse than before. So many days I just lay in bed and do nothing.

I know you mentioned about going to a doctor. But are you currently seeing a therapist right now?

Edit: Sorry I brushed over the CBT part. Just keep yourself busy. That's the biggest thing. You need to distract yourself from your negative emotions. Find little things that put a smile on your face. Pick up a hobby or start working out. Exercising can help get these thoughts and feelings out of your system. And it'll also help improve your self-esteem and confidence.

"Well...They thought I have ADHD when I was growing up, but it turns out, it was Asperger's. It was hell as a kid (I was bullied merciliessly because of it) and I remember crying a lot because I didn't want to go to school. I couldn't sit still and my teachers said I was a slob (messy desk/lockers). It turns out that I am actually on the Autism Spectrum because they figured out that I had/have the social aspects of Asperger's. No social skills, can't look people in the eye, etc. and I was very immature for my age. My mental age now is only 14-18. I am 47. It sucked as a kid, it sucks a little less as an adult, and I have other mental health issues that I am fighting right now...  


Sorry if that didn't help."
"Have you tried CBD oil? 

I use Charlotte’s Web Everyday Advanced formula because it’s a trusted brand, it’s accessible in my country and it’s high potency. Everyone is different but the low potency products do not work for me at all. Take any brand you like, but I encourage you to use a high potency product.

After years of depression, insomnia, living with trauma and plotting ways to end my suffering, I must say, I feel very emotionally resilient after topping up my endocannabinoid system (I just use CBD once or twice a month now as a maintenance kind of supplement but I used it much more frequently in February this year when I first started taking it and it work straight away) but prior to that I felt so, so broken and like I’d lost all my emotional strength. I had always been known as a strong person. After taking CBD, even without telling my friends, they said they could notice a difference and that I was like my old self again.

Good luck OP x"
"I'm a college professor and when I started out I was only 3-4 years older than most of my students (and I have since had students who were at least twice my age). Part of my attitude shift as an adult is that I focus less on the age difference between myself and others - as a kid there's this huge factor of knowing who is ""in charge,"" and it's usually the oldest person. I treat my students as adults, both because they are (although some only barely) and because they need to get used to that type of interaction. The therapist-patient interaction is similar - they can advise you and help you recognize or make plans, but ultimately it is up to you to live your life and be responsible for yourself. You aren't taking orders and they are not ""in charge"" of you - they are helping you work toward your goal, like a peer.

It is mainly important that you be comfortable sharing difficult thoughts with your therapist and being honest with her, so keep that as a priority."
"This is fairly normal.  Most people assume that a doctor or even a psychiatrist is going to listen to them talk for an hour or ask a ton of questions before prescribing if prescribing at all.  This is how things used to be a looooooooooong looooooooooong time ago when psychiatrists essentially were the only therapists.  


Now there is a clear differentiation between therapists and psychiatrists.  If you're lucky, a psychiatrist will spend a full 45minutes to an hour doing an initial psychiatric evaluation with you before discussing meds.  After that, you pop in for 15 minute check ups to adjust or change meds which occurs once a month or less often.  

General Practitioners are usually only willing to prescribe psych meds with little risk of serious side effects (SSRI's mostly, occasionally a benzo).   

This may sound harsh, but doctors (even most psychiatrists to an extent) are not trained to listen to, empathize with, and support their clients.  They're trained to identify a problem, make their best guess, and medicate, so that's exactly what many do.  


Keep this in mind.  Just because a doctor recommends you meds and writes a prescription, that doesn't mean you have to take it.  You could always tear it up, throw it away, and that's that.  If you're interested in seeing a therapist or seeking out alternatives to medication, ask your doctor for a recommendation to see if they know where to send you, or seek one out yourself.  


Did you end up getting a referral to a therapist or mental health agency?  I hope so.  Most studies show for depression/anxiety, the best results come from a combination of therapy and medication, but also that if you had to choose just one, regular therapy will be more effective. "
"As long as there is a threat of involuntary commitment, I feel like I have to keep my mental illness to myself to avoid being retraumatized in a hospital.  It does a great disservice to me and many others. "
"Assuming they are big enough and ugly enough to look after themselves it should be okay, nothing you can do but wait for them to get over it so you can help them. Whats their end goal in doing this anyway? "
"I know it's been a while, but if you're still looking check for any universities nearby that have psychology clinics. There are a lot of psychology programs out there that do relatively inexpensive testing."
"I'm not familiar with the feeling of being suicidal actually. When I'm going through something rough I get extreme anxiety precisely because I don't want to die.

Maybe there's some depression in there too?"
It's not your fault. Your dad's death isn't your mom's fault either. Your mom is wrong for blaming you while dealing with her grief. You can distance yourself from her as long as she is negative toward you.
Kati Morton takes a paragraph and spreads it out over 10 minutes. Her videos seem to be more about her face than any actual content. I'm surprised people mention her. Shes like a camwhore for mental health.
Thank you friend. I truly appreciate your support. My doctor has switched my meds and I’m supposed to start tonight. Guess we’ll see how it goes. Zoloft and Valium until I can get in to restart my TMS.
"Thanks a lot. I might try melatonin just to see if I can get more sleep and calm myself. 

What inward/outward signs do you exhibit that indicate a hypomanic/manic state (if you are bipolar, that is to say)"
"Well what is it exactly that so are so afraid of? What is the worst case scenario that is keeping you up at night? 

I think if we can get to the root of your anxiety we can talk it out and work through it!"
"Yeah , I was too young to really understand , mostly mad about all the meds I took before without really knowing why.. always felt different tho , of all the others kids even if I knew it wasn’t my fault "
Yeah we don't show our emotions enough I get told that a lot but people can't blame you for it because society has burned it into everyone's brain that if you open up about your feelings your less of a man
"Yes that's true just be with her. Make her feel that you never leave her, that you always understand her. Practice your patience and understanding bro. Don't get tired to her, show her that you are strong. "
"Yes. I have a psychiatrist and a psychologist who are the ones in charge of helping me with medication and therapy. We've been trying different things, hoping that I wouldn't get this specific side effect. "
"Do it back. even if you genuinely have no celebrity/actor crushes, or crushes in life period, just pretend to.

worst case scenario he gets mad and you have legitimate reason to leave because now there’s a tangible double standard (pssttt works for conservative folks as well because the traditional male female relationship is understandable and respectable but when it comes to hypotheticals there’s a line crossed) Best case scenario you guys bond over it"
"I do. In fact, I keep pads of paper around to write my thoughts down and one I've been trying to express for awhile finally came to me clearly this week: I feel like I'm simply meant to observe life, not participate. I feel incapable, as if it's a mistake I am here. I spend so much of my time in a dissociative state that it feels normal and it's impossible to reconcile that with trying to live my life. I often wonder why I am alive. What is the point of me? "
"I have bipolar and this shit isnt because hes bipolar, its because hes selfish and doesnt care about you in the long run. That's a him thing, not you or his disorder. People can not choose how they feel but they can choose how they act. They can choose to take preventative measures to keep from acting out, or they can choose not to because its not that important.

Let them have eachother. They're both a mess and you dont deserve to get dragged down with them"
"I'm glad to hear you have your daughter back now and all anyone can do is their best! 

I 100% agree with you - taking care of yourself can be hard enough at times, let alone putting someone else in the equation too. 

Yes, I am trying to keep focused on stuff I like, as previously I've fallen into loosing my interests and then all of a sudden I have no point in doing things. Maybe now while I am jobless I can spend time doing more things that make me happy."
"If you feel improvements in focus and wellbeing, and were struggling with those things prior to medication, then the medication is helping you. If it was difficult to function before, it can be argued that you need it. 

What is your purpose in making this statement, just out of curiosity? Are you hoping to convince people to stop their meds?

Also, I’m a little skeptical of your claim that you are a psychiatrist, as a psychiatrist is an MD and not a PhD. "
"It is very hard only a select few of people actually understand more than just the anxiety of it. I struggle with self harm a borderline eating disorder and suicidal tendencies, along with the emotional back flips that I do on to others. I wish people would understand that I don’t want to be this way but it’s embedded in my brain. Maybe I can just get a lobotomy haha. But thank you I guess I’ll just have to try some therapists and see which shoe fits. "
"Thank you for replying to me and I am sorry I am just writing back now. I just didn't want to look at this post again too soon after writing it.

I am feeling better, I kept hearing him for a few days and it's gone now. I had a few moments when the kids outside were screaming and it jolted me but that's been it. 

I haven't seen The Good Place but I will check it out along with your other recommendations.

Thank you again for writing, it really helped me. :)"
Thanks I've tried the samaritans and don't mean to be critical of volunteers but they couldn't sound any less interested and I think it actually made me feel worse. There is something called CALL helpline that has trained mental health people but they are impossible to get through on the phones. I just can't believe this has been going on nearly three years and feel like I've been passed around like a hot potato and still don't know who I can get help from.
"Yeah. I get that. I did the same thing at your age. Even now I still look around me and wonder where the hell my life has gone, and where it is going. I feel so lost and drifting sometimes. I see people MY age having great careers and all the luxuries of life, and here I am on Disability because I am a fuck up (pardon the language) and can't work. 

What would you like to do with your life? Do you have anything that is pulling you towards it, career-wise? :D"
You need to see a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner to be evaluated and to start medications (if you want to).  The medication you were on before may have caused you to have suicidal thoughts (side effect).  The are different medications out there that can be helpful.  Please let your doc know of the medication and your overdose.  Please don't allow your SO to discourage you from taking medications... Especially if you're willing to try again.
"&gt; It is more of a hassle for businesses, but this treats everyone as equals with their individual needs. 

Its an incredible hassle because when you expand on one's person's right, you inadvertently diminish another's.  Think of the old smoking laws.  We still have to provide a smoking section where I work because there are still smokers.  

Again, we get memos on this every month and the joke at work is that ""all dogs are now emotional support/therapy/rescue dogs"".  That can't be true.  There is no way to manage this and there has to be more to this than a doctor writing a note.  

Personally, I think the ADA ruling isn't clear.  Even our legal staff goes back and forth on it.  That said, I wish you luck."
"A psychologist said to me (this isn't verbatim, it has been a little while) ""(my name) you are suffering from pyromania and you need to talk to someone about it""...that scared the living \*censored\* out of me, made my heart drop into my feet, and made me sick and dizzy all at the same time. Just hearing those words, which I had suspected all along, was a shock, but also freeing. It has a name (I knew this already from the moment the urges to start fires out of nowhere had started) and now I can deal with it. Kinda. I am still having a hard time accepting it, and lots of times, I just feel like a freakshow. I KNOW nobody can see anything different about me, but I feel different. Anyway. That is my experience."
"I don't deal with this at work, I keep my mental health struggles to myself (not that everyone should do that, I just have had many instances in the past of being judged for them and would rather avoid it.) I do have to deal with this from my dad though. Any mention of how 4 years of night shift put me in a depression so bad that I gained 70 lbs from binge eating, etc, is met with ""I don't believe in those things."" Any mention of my mom's bipolar disorder, I get ""well all of us have a little bit of that in us."" The funny thing is my dad suffers from the worst anxiety of anyone I know. I guess it's easier to deny something exists than to admit it's there and seek help. Some people are uneducated and ignorant. "
"I had really weird side effects (heart racing, dilated pupils,body swelling, and I could feel my blood moving through my body which I assume was a form of itching) from taking lexapro as well. So my doctor made me take a Benadryl as to not have a serious reaction and they immediately called in zoloft instead. He had never heard of anyone having that kind of a reaction, but that’s the somewhat scary thing about medications. Thankfully zoloft worked well for me so I was able to stop my search there. I’d suggest being aware of your body and not taking anything a second time that makes you feel that uncomfortable. There are so many medications that you’ll find one that works without the crazy side effects. "
"I understand this. It’s maddening, really, to feel so completely awful and wanting to hurt yourself so badly over something you KNOW isn’t as big of a deal as it feels. 

Try to remember that those feelings, although awful, are only temporary. I know it’s easier said than done. I know when I feel like harming myself I do so because it’s a distraction from what’s really going on, so I try to muster up the courage to do something productive instead. What that is can be different for everyone - taking a peaceful walk, yoga, hard-core exercising, journaling your heart out, having a solo dance party, making art, etc.

Sending lots of love. Even when it doesn’t feel like it - life is worth living ❤️"
"I've been struggling with the same thing.  My job is slowly killing me I feel like.  I feel so underappreciated, I feel stuck in a dead end with no future, but I am scared to quit because I would have no money and nowhere to go.

Every time I am at the office recently I feel like I cannot breathe, and I don't know what to say to my coworkers or other people.  

My best friend is not there for me in my toughest moments, she told me recently that since I am a guy she shouldn't need to care about my feelings since I should be strong enough to deal with them on my own, and its been hard not having anyone to talk to, but someone is always there for you when you need it.

Let me know if you want to talk at any time"
"I’m almost 40 and things have gotten better... after a lot of counseling. Years and years of counseling. I remember my lowest moment- I’d just given birth to my first child. The pain of childbirth had triggered tons of PTSD crap but I figured things would be better as I held him and tried to nurse him. After all, having a baby was all I’d ever wanted in this world, so it was going to be great, right? Nope. The sensation of him nursing caused flashbacks. His crying caused panic attacks. Once my husband had to go back to work six weeks later, I developed postpartum depression so bad that I spent my days laying on my bed with him in a bassinet next to me. I felt truly broken.

I still wish I’d hit rock bottom before having a child so I could have realized that I needed an antidepressant and trauma counseling. I was so much healthier mentally by the time I had my third child and I wish I hadn’t been robbed of a positive experience the first time around. "
"To offer a counterpoint: I have a recent diagnosis of social anxiety (among others, like GAD and panic disorder, as well as depression) and unless you know me well and met me casually at a party you'd think I was the most confident extrovert ever. 

What you don't see is the days of pep-talks convincing me to go to the party in the first place or the panic attack and violent shakes in the bathroom after I tell the joke.

""Why not just go and not tell the joke"" you might ask? I ask myself that all the damned time. Due to a lot of childhood stuff I feel a need to pretend to be shinyhappyperfect in public because my mom was so mentally ill I had to be the adult with their shit together so I wasn't a burden.

I don't have a 'go to the party but only talk to close friends and leave early' mode and it takes a HUGE amount of energy to put on the confident face. Being around people gives me awful anxiety to the point of physical symptoms, but I also do awful when my depression keeps me isolated.

Some of us with social anxiety are good fakers. That said I know the type you mean and they're the same who ""just saw x movie and are so depressed now"" or ""feeling so OCD"" because they sorted their skittle color or something. "
"I want to congratulate you for realizing you have a problem that you need help with and reaching out to others to learn about your options. I too have struggled with severe anxiety and panic attacks so I understand how you feel.

First, you need to go see medical professionals. You will likely need to go to your primary care (or pediatrician if you still go to one) who can then refer you to a psychiatrist and a therapist. Your primary care will likely need to run some tests as there are medical reasons that could be causing your anxiety (thyroid and hormone problems are just two of the many). Most insurance companies won't allow you to just make an appointment with a psychiatrist or therapist without first seeing your primary care. You can find out who is covered under your insurance if you call them or check your insurance's website as every insurance company has a provider search to find medical doctors. (If you need help finding this link, let me know what insurance you have and I'll see if I can find it.) Start with a therapist **BEFORE** jumping on medication and see how it goes. If traditional CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) aka talk therapy doesn't help or reduce your anxiety, ask the therapist if they can do DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) which is a different type of therapy that changes the way you perceive and think about things. For me, DBT helped far more than CBT but everyone is different. If you see a psychiatrist, they will likely start by prescribing an SSRI antidepressant like Zoloft (sertraline) as that's the first line of meds for depression and anxiety. SSRIs work wonderfully for some people but not everyone. It can take a long time to find a combination of a good therapist, good psychiatrist, and a medication that helps so you have to give it time and it may be a lot of trial and error. Just be patient and continue to go to therapy weekly or more often if needed while you wait for the medication to start to work as anti-depressants take about 8 weeks before they build up in your system. 

Whatever you do, do **NOT** allow any doctor to prescribe you a benzodiazepine (aka benzo) like Xanax (Alprazolam), Klonopin (Clonazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), Valium (Diazepam), etc. Those drugs are marketed as anti-anxiety drugs but they're the devil and there are many other drugs that can be tried that aren't dangerous or addictive. They're super addictive and can kill you if you miss a dose or try to get off them without tapering. I didn't realize how bad they were when I was first put on them and struggled with them for 8 years before I finally had to go to a detox and rehab to get off them. They work great for occasional anxiety but for constant anxiety like you're feeling, it wouldn't work as they can't be taken daily without addiction. Very few doctors realize how dangerous benzos are but thankfully now they're starting to learn. I was on Xanax and Klonopin for 8 years and they almost killed me. You can see the entire /r/benzorecovery if you don't believe me.

&gt; My point is I feel like this all stems from social anxiety, and with my childhood friends off to college I feel so fucking lonely. My friends have been able to make new friend groups where they are, but I'm back at home in community college unable to do anything more than small talk with one person at a time where sometimes my voice trembles and they think I'm weird.

I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely normal. A big problem today is that many young people experience regular anxiety and think they have an anxiety disorder and need medication when in reality, it's just normal anxiety. I don't believe that is what you are and I believe you need help but you also need to realize that certain things in life, like your friends going away to college, is normal and causes everyone anxiety. This is all stuff a therapist would work with you on.

&gt; I've been doing research and I saw a medication called ""Propranolol"".

As far as Propranolol, yes, it's a great med for both migraines and anxiety, although it was originally made for blood pressure. I've been on it for anxiety for over 10 years and it definitely helps the physical symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks without all the negative side effects that many of the medications do. I would definitely ask your doctor if they could prescribe 10 mg and see if it helps. I take 20 mg and it gets rid of many of the physical symptoms but I started on only 5 or 10 mg. They also have an extended release version if you think that would work better.

&gt; If I use my Mom's insurance card will she see that I went to the doctor and got meds?

If you're on your parents' insurance, yes, they will see that you went to a specific doctor. If you were to fill a prescription under their insurance, yes, they can see that. You're 19 so you may be better off getting your own insurance if you can. I know every college offers insurance so you could get it that way or you could get Medicaid since you don't have any income. I actually saved a ton of money after I got off my parents' insurance and switched to Medicaid. It all depends on your state and what insurance your parents' have and what is available to you.

&gt; I'm 19 and need a job.

You have two options. You can either get a job or volunteer. If you need a job, you could apply everywhere and anywhere, even something like retail or fast food where they're always looking for workers, or you could go to your college's career center and they have ways to get students jobs either at the school or at different places. Since you're already 19, you really should have some job experience by now and getting a job through your school would definitely help. If you absolutely can't get a job, volunteer. I have horrible anxiety and panic attacks that make me vomit and faint every time and this is why I have volunteered on and off for most of my life, whenever I wasn't working. There are so many places that need volunteers and you could make a huge difference in someone's life. I personally have volunteered with different animal organizations and local shelters. There are always places like animal shelters, zoos, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, elderly homes, hospitals, etc. that need volunteers. Not only will you be helping that organization, but you'll be helping yourself and it will look good on your resume.

If you want to talk or just want someone to listen to you, I'm always here. I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for my entire life so I completely understand how you feel. If you need help trying to find help, I can do that too. Just keep your head up and remember to push yourself out of your comfort zone and do something every day that you wouldn't normally do. Just remember that you will feel better soon and try to stay as positive as possible."

"Again, I’m sorry you feel that way. I hope this new sub being advertised in OP is a safe place for you, and that whatever you’re presently going through is solved and sorted with minimal pain. Good luck!"
"Hey first thing -- I have no idea what could happen with Valium overdose -- are you ok? And have you got your cuts dressed yet? Whatever done is done, just go with some damage controls now. I hope you're ok."
"I also wanted to share this, which has been a veey helpful website to me: https://www.helpguide.org. It could be helpful to your friend and you in supporting them. I hope it’s helpful. I wish you the best."
I don't know if I have anything besides that but I won't rule it out. I've noticed that the hypochondria usually comes with situations in life that are stressful anyways so maybe there's something to that...
"I don’t think I’m doing therapy anymore it just hasn’t helped or been enjoyable. But I’ll take a good look and do some research on hypothyroidism and go to my doctor to get it checked out, thank you."
I'd do it right back to him but I'm spiteful like that. Whenever some hot guy is on tv start going on about how good looking he is and what you'd like to do to him. Guaranteed your husband will get annoyed.
I'm really glad you shared your perspective. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of yourself so it's very encouraging to hear such a balanced viewpoint with a positive outcome. Hope your progress continues.
Its okay it’s pretty similar to Persecutory delusionals. You could as well be paranoid they’re pretty damn similar. I had it where I thought people were going to harm me which I guess isn’t paranoia...
"Its the fact that I need to be responsible for everything after gettig  help that affects me 2...

If I get cured theres alot of work that needs to ve done.. and I feel incapable but its not an option for me"
"Or maybe because it’s 2:30am where I’m at??  And yeah very smart in being able to tell what I am based off of just the way I write, you must be a very smart man, I’m sure your IQ is at Einstein level, "
"Thanks... Since it sounds like we were in somewhat similar situations, I have to say I am really proud of you for recognizing that and changing for the better. I promise you, he's just happy you're better :)"
"This is how I felt. I am an alcoholic, and after years and years of heavy drinking and quitting and falling off the wagon, I finally quit for good on 9/11/16. It does feel great, doesn't it? Congrats to you!"
"This made me smile to see. It’s very reassuring and I just wanted to say I’m proud of you for seeking help and sticking with it. That is a huge accomplishment, and I hope you’re proud of yourself too! "
Well it has been said sometimes it's not the destination it is the journey. And life is a highway I want to ride it all night long. But long drives are very relaxing to me as well because they clear my mind.
"Yeah that makes total sense.
I'm unfortunately the kind of person who gives people way too many chances and finds it hard to walk away but it also means I constantly get walked all over. But I just cant stop"
"Yeah... knowing you do that is the first step though... to be honest, the fact you have such interest in creating art is amazing. I think it's wonderful on its own and also in the context of your struggles. "
"You're right, I am ignorant to what you're going through and that your thoughts are like. I was also ignorant to how my selfish decision would affect my family and friends. Good thing I forgot the knife haha"
"usually because with depression everything just seems simpler and less complicated​. you wake up, do your shit, go to bed (or try to). it's a whole blob of gray and you can just go on auto-pilot for while."
"&gt; sorry to hear that... and yeah I agree, women do often make things so complicated, it's toxic but my problem is that I jump back into toxic waste again and again cz I am addicted to it. Idk how to get out, I want to get out for a while to get my head straight.

I am no expert in this area but me being in therapy for other issues, I would recommend it to you.  
    
Each of us is addicted to misery but each in our own way.  Channeling my therapist here.

"
"Could it be those things you listed? Maybe. But it could also be recurring nightmares, or perhaps something else entirely. You're making the right decision in talking about it with your therapist. They're there to help you work through and process the sorts of feelings you're describing, after all. I'm sorry you're feeling the way you are (with the anxiety about the sleeptalking and the bouts of depression), and I hope your recovery is as speedy as it can be."
"Right, long distance is hard. One thing to do is to make her gifts, if you’re capable. My thing is crochet (it’s not hard, I promise) so I make things for my boyfriend when I miss him. I know I appreciate having my boyfriend’s sweater to sleep in. Obviously this is a more personal piece of advice, but my first instinct would be to make a scarf or blanket for her. If there’s something similar you think she’s appreciate, handmade gifts really do help."
"Steroids can totally change your emotions and make you feel all over the place, also if you have someone managing your mental health I would inform them that this 
 is happening, Primary docs know a lot but many of them are not all that well versed on mental health. Here is one artice on Prednisone and it's effects on mental health, if you google ""Prednisone effect on mood"" more will come up. https://medshadow.org/features/prednisone-psychiatric-side-effects/"
"They were really common, unfortunately. The biggest offenders were super obvious. The others I just felt... off. It takes some time to find the right meds. Don't give up! I'm not sure if it's available where you are but my head doc did something called a Gene Sight, it tests how effective meds are within your system. The first ones I went on (different doc) were horrible with my system (wonder why they didn't work...)

Hang in there, it's tough but worth it. "
"don't you have anything you enjoy doing? i was in the same place your age. also anger issues and stuff. i just kinda shut into myself and stopped going to school and played video games. mom eventually stopped caring. then i felt depressed because of loneliness and found a girl that was also like this and she moved in with me. that helped a ton. i make music to feel like i have a slight purpose, but mostly i feel like life is pretty pointless and frustrating. "
"Hmmm...I wonder if the absitnence from drinking is now actually making it worse. Even though these symptoms were subdued while drinking, they were there. It's like you quit, and that blocker had now been removed, and these symptoms are coming back with a vengence (and a few friends). I have a delayed onset of a pretty rare disorder, and it was aggravated by stress and an outside trigger. It had always been there, but drinking had made me forget about it for a while. It never came to the surface because the alcohol hid it down deep. Now I am sober and everything that I had been hiding is coming out. 

I sure hope you can get it sorted out soon. You sound like a lovely person and I wish only the best for you. :)"
"I am single after heart break and humiliation yup cannot imagine/ I couldn’t before it happened. If someone tell me to move on and learn to love myself - I smile sweetly and tell them to fuck off because they have what I lost or don’t want what lost. 

I understand your plight - any age - any gender- most people don’t want to be alone, they want a partner.  
That validation enough? I won’t equate loneliness and frustration to slavery though as that minimizes a horrendous experience. 

Since you want a girlfriend what are you doing to get one? 
Working on social anxiety issues, personal hygiene and fitness, career and stable income, hobbies and social group and conversation skills, managing addictions? "
"What I meant with that comment is that you need to take it slow. I think its easy to lose perspective over the big picture when multiple tragedies and difficulties have hit you all at once (more or less). I am sorry about the death of your brother but you need to decide to move past it and try to find your own path one step at a time. I know Seoul can be an unforgiving place....I moved here from abroad so I know. 

You are really young to have had all these difficulties hit you at once but dont lose the forest for the trees. All of this is experiences you can and will live though and 10 years from now will be distant memories. Thats why if its hard now, just take it one step at a time cuz thats all you can do."
"Like most mental conditions it differs from individual to individual. Some sociopaths are fully aware that they are sociopaths while some may not be. I have met sociopath who was diagnosed and hadn't a single clue about it, and I have known some who knew almost immediately that they were sociopaths. Sociopaths make up 4% of the population, you probably know one without realizing it.

I would say someone who is a sociopath would not be in denial or question it. In my personal experience with sociopaths (sociopathy runs in the family, I'm not a medical professional, purely observation);  being a 'sociopath' doesn't matter enough to them to question it, they simply are. Unless being known as a sociopath benefits them in some way, it doesn't get brought up. 

OP, you don't sound like a sociopath to me. But sociopaths differ like any other group of people, you would have to talk to a professional who has a full view of your life and medical history to know for sure."
"19 f here. Everything you’ve described sounds very similar to what I’ve gone through myself for the past few years and I’m on the brink of pulling myself out of this rut. What I’ve learned is this line of experiences are quite common, most young people go through varying degrees of this mindset. If you are truly concerned that you might have a disorder, don’t self-diagnose, seek a therapist or simply express your concerns to a counselor (if you’re in school). Your day-dreaming sounds simply like you are imagining the various paths your future could take, that’s ambition and more power to you! You’re in the hardest stage of your known life, but with plenty of strength- which it sounds like you have, congrats on getting  back in shape!- you will pull through victorious. What helped me begin to discover myself and grow stronger was taking a spontaneous international trip on my own. Being able to go out and enjoy myself alone has really changed my outlook on the possibilities of my future. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend going out to dinner, a movie, or even a trip if you can on your own. It will help you to get to know and understand yourself.
Stay strong! I believe in your potential :)"
"As someone who suffered/suffers with an eating disorder and body dysmorphia, you definitely need to not talk to her about her looks. At all. Tell her she’s beautiful, you love her and all that but do not try to switch the focus to something else like “try getting toned instead of skinny”. It will only make her more focused on her body and self conscious. Just steer clear of discussion of food and exercise in general and encourage her to take more rest days/eat what she wants. You can do this by setting an example. Tell her you’re concerned about her relationship ship with her body (and food if that’s an issue too) and you want to help her be happier with herself. Tell her you’re there if she needs anything and that it hurts you to see her tear herself apart like that. This is what my boyfriend did and it was the most helpful thing because if you’re not ready to get help, having someone force you into it won’t work. Make yourself open and approachable and let her know you see an issue but don’t force her to try to fix it immediately. She will when she’s ready, otherwise you’ll just make her not trust you because she will think you’re trying to coerce her into something she doesn’t want. "
"\`hey there. have been in the same boat and commend you for taking control of your mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

when you approach your gp, be very specific that you are suicidal and your suicidality is related to stress from work. They are obligated to assit you, and if assistance is not forthcoming from your usual GP, I would suggest protesting directly, and vigorously. If they still wont shife, ask to speak to the Practice Leader (if they are at a medical centre, 'the boss'). if that doesnt work, find another GP that will help you.

&amp;#x200B;

Suicidality is your minds way of telling you that you and your current situation are not compatible. Even if you are not planning on acting on it, compound stress over time can have a very serious effect on mental and physical wellbeing, and staying in your current situation sounds like it could be very bad for you. Stress can be cumulative, and it can be very hard to recover from being under stress for too long (speaking from experience). 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you find a solution! A change to another employer maybe? Hopefully the break from work will give you the headspace you need to discover what you need to get out of this situation, 

&amp;#x200B;

"Thanks a lot for your response my friend. Yeah it terms of similarities with anxiety I agree that it certainly does share a lot of traits. And yeah it may well be just a new level of anxiety as you say. It could certainly make sense of it.

The only thing that makes me see the two as different, despite the apparent similarity in symptoms, is that when I have this response I don't necessarily need to feel anxious at all. I mean often the main emotion I am feeling is something distinct from anxiety, like anger or frustration. 

And the other thing that makes me want to differentiate it from anxiety is that while there are certain situations that are established sources of anxiety for me, the appearance of this weird reaction doesn't really correlate with the appearance of these situations much at all. I can be at my fathers house completely separated from every possible source of anxiety, and still be feeling this response as if it's just hanging around in the background as if it's just some unrelated part of how I'm configured.

Although now that you've got me thinking about it I'm realising that self-criticism at least is certainly a source of it. When those sort of topics enter my mind I start to feel blood rushing through my chest and neck instantly. And you certainly could call fear of criticism a form of anxiety. 

So yeah you make a really good point, you've got me rethinking things a lot now. Thanks a lot my friend, your help to me is extremely appreciated."
Ahh I see... gonna Google that later! My neighbourhood gives free services for mental health to youths. Wanted a third party opinion before I applied for a walk-in. Don’t want to take up a slot! Thank you!
"Contact Social Services in your area and see if anybody accepts payment on a sliding scale.  I see a psychotherapist for $20.00 a session.  Without good health insurance, your options are very limited. Sorry."

"A lot depends on how you're defining ""can be cured.""

* If you mean, ""can be cured, right now, for all people,"" then no.  If it could, we'd have done it by now.

* If you mean, ""can be cured, right now, for some people,"" then yes.  Some people go through depressive periods or have other bouts with mental Illness and bounce back no worse for the wear.

* If you mean, ""can be cured at some point in the future,"" either for all people or for a few, then maybe.

"He fears his own sleep, but is disgusted when others sleep - he sees it as a weakness of a kind? He said that he doesn't know a reason why he fears it, it's completely irrational for him. He doesn't have any trauma or issues as far as he knows. It's mystery to us both. I was just wondering if there isn't specific phobia like this. I guess it would ease his mind if there was a name for his problem. (sorry for my bad English, I am not a natural English speaker) "
"Hey, we all need to generate money in some way to sustain ourselves. It's important and necessary but it's not the main purpose of our existence. Money is just a tool that serves to help us live better lives, it is not the money itself that is important.

"Hey, yes I totally agree, if something affect your systematic functioning, like not being able to leave your house, you have a disorder. 

What I'm trying to say is that ADHD doesn't have to be a disorder. I'll be making more videos in the future how a person with adhd can actually function quite well in todays society. For example, there's actually lots of different jobs in which people without ADHD couldn't cope, and people with ADHD can thrive (e.g. sales)."
"I don't think romantication is an issue. Rather what feel romantication is. Romantication isn't using your illness as an excuse to be an ass, but that's what everyone seems to use as an example.

Like you said romantication in the ""right"" way can help people cope and I don't think it has a negative impact if it isn't used as an excuse. Romantication could only end badly imo if it is portrayed false in media for example and therefore gets a negative stereotype."
I get that. Sometimes when it's at it's worst it's like thousands of bugs are on me but other days it's only a couple. Mine is most likely just a tactile hallucination as I have had other hallucinations and have had issues with a different tactile hallucination before. I find like gently rubbing all over the affected areas can be helpful. Like just gently so you have the real sensation from your hands and often that calms it down or stops it altogether for me.
"I'm with you here. There's a lot of inappropriate advice being given to OP and a lot of information missing for anyone to be able to help. There's a limit to what we can suggest and I'd say it lies at the point where we advise openly communicating and going to a relationship counselor. No more.

Edit: Also, /u/Ryaubee is not a counselor. Please do not take advice from her. She is a writer and her behaviour on this sub is incredibly misguided and inappropriate."
"Instant messaging can catch people at any time of their day. There's numerous reasons why people don't take the time to respond back right away but it doesn't necessarily reflect on how they feel about you. From your perspective they are ignoring you but from theirs, they likely have a reason. If you sense bad thoughts coming because this happens to you, distract yourself with something else. If you can't shake the thoughts, try meditation to clear your head. "
"This is one reason I sometimes feel like I give into my mental illness more. When I show up to work and all of my commitments and appear happy, then I oddly feel like im invalidating my mental illness because to everyone else, I appear just fine, when in actuality I feel like shit. I do usually feel better when I follow through with my commitments, but I hate the idea of pretending. That being said, it's probably my mental illness that is telling these things."
"Yes, I do believe that I show some signs of BPD (and my therapist agrees with me) but she doesn't think I have enough to be diagnosed. She's pretty sure that I just have plain old depression, but I feel like it's more than that. I'll keep talking to her about it tho.

My childhood was honestly very relaxed and chill. The most ""traumatic"" thing that's happened to me was moving all over the place, which just made me awkward and robbed me of a solid friend group."
"You can't deal with negative emotions maybe because they are ""too negative"". It might be related to your childhood maybe some traumatic thing you experienced. This might caused you to learn to bottle up your negative emotions and that just makes it hard to handle them. In that case you need someone to talk about safely about those and that someone would probably a professional. Other than that I don't have any idea, I hope this helps, I hope you get well soon."
"I just quit my job, I was earning a decent wage but had been there 14 years and was having frequent days off due to mental health issues. Although they were very understanding I just felt like the responsibility was getting on top of me and it’s very hard to keep calling in saying you don’t feel mentally well, it shouldn’t be, but it is.

I realised that working less hours would mean I couldn’t afford some of the luxuries I was used to but I could still live adequately if I budgeted correctly. I’m so much happier already 3 weeks on and I’ve really noticed an improvement in my state of mind. To me that’s far more important than a luxury lifestyle. Sometimes you just really need a well earned rest. "
"I'm the rock that holds my family together. I'm strong when they're not, they rely on me for it. I know it'll be chaos once I'm gone, but I just can't take it anymore. You say to hold out, but for what? I've been holding out for so long it doesn't feel like it's worth it anymore. My hope of it changing is all gone.  


My family doesn't know what it's like to never enjoy anything. It's a step past no motivation. With a lack of motivation there are things you want to do, but aren't motivated to do. With me, I genuinely don't want to do anything. I would think if they knew how it really felt to live like this for this long, it would be selfish on their end as well to want me to stay knowing how torturous this is."
"My advice is to just keep your mental health issues out of the work place, unless you think they are putting your job at risk and perhaps sharing will help things, or unless you really trust them.

People who don't suffer with these things will likely never understand and will just see you as ""crazy"". Of course some rare people will understand but I don't think it is worth the risk. Probably better to just make up an excuse about why you're crying or acting a certain way.

I have a lot of sympathy for your experience - these kinds of interactions can make you feel so isolated and frustrated. So I just avoid it all together and don't mention it, let them think I'm perfectly ""normal"". :)

Most of my friends can't handle it either so these days Reddit is pretty much the only place I open up about these things.

I know the cat's out of the bag now but, since he doesn't seem to understand the severity, it doesn't sound like it's too late to sweep it under the carpet."
"Sounds like derealization &amp; or depersonalisation which is a type of dissociation. It’s a reaction to stress or traumatic experiences. It’s quite normal as it’s a reaction out brain has to protect us, but if it’s really effecting you I suggest looking for someone to talk to! &amp; if that’s not an option, just educate yourself on it. I promise you aren’t loosing your mind, your brain is just trying to keep you safe (in a really annoying way). Try not to think about it too much, you will 100% dissociate more if you think about it. Look up grounding techniques, that make you feel more connected to the world! Like having something textured in your pocket at all times to touch so you feel more real! Hope this helps! 

P.s talking to a doctor about this is key if you can, because it might not be a mental health issue it could be medical or neurological, or it could be something to do with your eyes! Don’t stress but it’s worth getting checked out x"
"This was my first time taking it (28yrs). I had no idea. My pharmacist was actually shocked that the hospital where I’ve received most of my psychiatric care did not taper me off initially when I visited their ER. 

I understand when I’m low, and I understand when I’m high. I was not diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but SSRIs cause me to become manic if the dosage is too high. This is a lot like that, but I’m cycling multiple times a day. I’m sweating like crazy, and I just get blinded with rage or sadness. 

I have a great support system. My PCP wanted me to go back to the ER, but I am not going to be admitted to the psych hospital over this. My family and I have gone to our “safety plan” for when I’m feeling low and now that I at least have a better understanding of it being the medicine, and not me, I don’t feel like such a huge piece of shit. I will add, I am NOT suicidal; but as many of you know it’s depression, the thoughts can linger. "
"You should totally follow forums or blogs that can relate to you or, even better, have the same image as you! If you have a Instagram try following some body positivity accounts! I struggle with my weight and always had since I was a kid (starving,binging, overeating, all that Jazz) and ever since following a bunch of body positivity pages, I’ve slowly started to feel better about my own skin. A good Instagram account I follow is [@Noairbrushedme](https://www.instagram.com/nonairbrushedme) and they try to cover everything for body positivity. If that doesn’t really fit your style, try looking up some other accounts! Body positivity accounts usually tag other accounts in their posts so it’s easier to find ones that you think suit you better.

I think the more you surround yourself with positivity, the more confidence you build up for yourself. Then soon you’ll realize “Hey. This is 2018. Almost 2019. Everybody is different and that’s okay. We all have our own beauty marks and that’s what makes us unique.” Because could you imagine a world where we all looked the same?! Boring :P lol. Yea, you’ll occasionally run into some people that aren’t as open minded as we are. But as long as you keep surrounding yourself with body positivity with little reminders throughout the day that you’re beautiful in your own way, those mean voices start to get smaller and won’t matter. 

I hope this helped and wish you the best of luck in your journey! :) ��"
"Youre feelings are valid and youre not alone.
Best thing to do when you don't know what to do is just do something, anything. Your enemy is inaction.

Not something dramatic, just something. If you are struggling to get out of bed, that's fine. Get a book, read, in bed. Get out a pen, write, draw, doodle, whatever. You'll find just doing something will get the ball rolling. 

Start with self care and things will roll on from that. Focusing on big picture stuff like job and partners are too massive and broad to feel like we have any control over. Ultimately, it's the little things we do that effect our mental health.
What makes you feel good? If you can't think of anything, that's okay. What makes you feel grounded/present? Could be as simple as being out in public, or at the beach, or washing your face, or singing to music. Tiny things. 

I use the headspace app for mindfulness. I try to do it every day. I count to 10 to get myself out of bed, and then I just do it. I make my bed, which just stArts the day off a little better. 

Talk to someone. Express yourself. It'll help, can guarantee. Not immediately, but in time. Seeing a professional was super useful for me, even when I didn't think it would be. 

I like to imagine having a little kid with me that I'm looking after,and I move around the day as if I have that kid by my side. I treat myself with the same love and care that I would that kid, and it helps me realise when I might be being a bit harsh on myself.

"I have bipolar ll disorder in which i think you might have too. 

I was correctly diagnosed about 6 months ago (i have been 2 years on therapy) because i was being treated for depression due to borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorder. The psychiatrist opted for Zoloft an anti-depressant and Klonopin (for sleep) because i slept 4hrs. Zoloft worked for the depression in an incredible way i was actually happy and i could enjoy life plus i slept 8 hrs after 3 months then it all went downhill fast i a period of 3 months i started speeding from 60mph min to 110 mph max and i a college student used all my saved up money and used some credit cards after that which left me in debt but i managed to return the merchandise and amazon returned the money the total was about $6,000 but i still couldn't return the car -_- moving on. The psychiatrist said i had a hypomaniac episode which was produced by the Zoloft. She discontinued it and started me on Depakote a mood stabilizer every month they have bumped up my med because it hasn't reached 100% i dont have those fast ups and downs anymore (at least for now) i feel ""normal"" by people standards but i really miss my crazy self since im really boring when im normal.

My suggestion is go to a therapist and tell him everything and i mean everything that will help the diagnosis faster maybe in only one session they will refer you to a psychiatrist.

If you do go and get meds ""DON'T"" stop using them. If you go to much without meds you'll lose contact with reality like me it is not in anyway pleasent. Also if and only if you're boring like me ask for a ""LOW"" dose of anti-depressant this helps a lot but it also has risk.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me here"
"It depends on the mental illness. I'll tell you what I've personally seen a lot of:

-BPD people with lots of quotes about how it's hard and how nobody understands them and how people need to be more understanding and what amounts to, basically excuses for why they act the way they do, self-destructive and self-sabotaging and willing to damage themselves for sympathy and attention rather than working their emotions out or seeking to. I have seen people excuse smashing windows, breaking things, threatening others with knives, and I had someone immediately position themselves as victim because I didn't like a cartoon show they liked, and told them I didn't think it was done as well as it could have been done. When I told him it was my opinion, he said he expected an apology for my wrong opinion. Basically, minimizing how much they hurt or disregard others while claiming they can't help it and ""it's just how I am"" and ""my mental illness"".

-in actual relationships, I have seen both guys get involved with women that are unstable expecting to ""fix"" them and women getting involved with men expecting to ""be fixed"". And women thinking they can fix a guy's depression and self-sabotaging. For that, I see a lot of society stuff where love is gonna fix everything and make it all better and being in a relationship will somehow fix years of untamed mental illness and an unwillingness to go to a therapist, get on medication, or even google ""why do I get panic attacks when I don't constantly have someone to talk to"" and try to stop the panic attacks rather than doggedly seeking out attention from tinder or the like.

So, somewhat directly, and somewhat indirectly. Both situations come across like someone who doesn't really want to get better, but does want to find momentary comforts to feel justified in their mental illness. Especially the annoying quotes I find on pinterest talking about how the love from BPD people is just ""too much"". Like that's a good excuse for hurting others."
"Hey!   


I have heard of ""derealization"" as well, sometimes it's used interchangeably with ""depersonalization"", I've had a few experiences with it myself, and it is a difficult thing to explain or understand for sure. I went to see a doctor after my first experience, and she told me it was very likely anxiety-induced. I did some more research as well as tried to make sense of it myself over the years. My first time was in class at university, i was not fully following what the prof was teaching and realized I was very behind and confused, I guess my mind freaked out to a level I have never experienced before (I had A LOT of pressure, from myself, to get good grades and graduate, become a real adult etc- basically my quarter century life crisis), so I think my mind kind of just snapped at that point and realized everything was way too stressful and overwhelming to cope with anymore... so it just left my body?? and then I recall vividly, feeling like my soul floated out of my body and was just above me lingering in the air, watching back down on my body sitting there lifelessly. It really freaked me out as well, I felt very detached from reality and i couldn't really comprehend what my classmates were saying to me, nor could I really put words together to speak, it was as if i was zoned out. I've also had a few other occassions where I have zoned out while driving and suddenly realized I have reached my destination, but have no memory of how I got there ( I Guess i was on autopilot). In my experience, I do find it anxiety or depression related, i think its when everything gets too much and my mind just wants to escape it somehow. I've also read about people who experienced traumatic things (like sexual abuse, violence, wars etc) that have ""zoned out"" or ""left their body"" while horrible things were happening to them, because their mind simply couldn't take in what was happening. It's possible that it's a coping mechanism to extreme stress/pain for some people.   


Anyways, what has been somewhat helpful for me is practicing grounding exercises, to bring you back into reality and get in touch with your body.  When you begin feeling detached and like everything around you ""isn't real"" focus on your senses, list 5 things you see, list 5 smells you smell, list 5 colors around you, touch 5 different objects near you slowly, count 5 breathes in and out, etc. This has helped bring me back to reality, it's helped my mind connect with my body again. Another thing that may help is slowly caressing your arm or palm, and trying to feel those sensations. wiggle your toes and feel them wiggling in your shoes/socks. I've also repeated in my mind ""you are safe. You are safe. You are safe"" very calmly, to reassure myself that I am safe,even though I feel like everythings spinning out of control. From my understanding, depersonalization/derealization happens when there is a disconnect between your mind and your body, it may be a coping mechanism for some, and it can be triggered from stress/anxiety. Try to be aware of any triggers, notice if any situations lead to episodes of feeling detached. That way, you can learn to avoid/prevent triggering circumstances and minimize the episodes.   


I also really enjoy this one breathing exercise that helps with my anxiety, breathe in and out very very quickly, to the point youre out of breath. and imagine that everytime your exhaling, that youre blowing out the anxiety/stress/negative feelings.   


Good luck and thanks for sharing your experience! "
I read a story of a person who said she would find her self writing down what she was experiencing at the moment and that would help get through that period.. kinda like a anchor that's keeping you in realty
"*Raises hand* I will listen to you as much as you want to vent. :) Just leave me a private message. If I don't get it tonight, I will get it after 6 am my time tomorrow. I will be going to bed very soon. &lt;3"
"Dr had me on Zoloft for post-pardum depression because he said it was the safest for breastfeeding. No problems, and now my baby is 15 years old, no health issues for her, no problems w her cognitive ability. "
"Honestly your therapist can suggest at physical causes but unless your doctor agrees they absolutely should not be calling any physical cause the source of your mental illness. This therapist sounds sketchy.

"I don't have any great suggestions at this moment. But I love the idea. Which is why I suggest the mods make this a sticky post. Excellent question! (Also, keep up the good work, u/glas...  umm... uh... yeah!)"
"I often think that my life is just a really long drug trip from the first time I smoked pot or something. I’ll wake up out of the trip one day, as a 14 year old again. That would be pretty amazing honestly. "
I'd say that there's a good chance that it's a repressed feeling. But I'm also not a doctor so I could be wrong. Just make sure to bring it up to your therapist on Thursday. See what they have to say about it.
It sounds like you should get back on some medication. If the ones you have taken before we’re not helpful try a new one. As you know most do take a few months to work though so it won’t help immediately.
"Narcissism is treated as a character flaw, though studies have shown Narcissistic Personality Disorder to be an incurable mental disorder that makes the person with the disorder suffer to a fairly huge degree."
"OOOh, a ""The Office"" fan? :D I Live in Scranton, PA lol. EVERYONE asks me about that.

I agree with this totally. Keep your friend occupied if you can and just be there for them when they need to talk/vent. :)"
"Sorry that this is such a mess for you. I can't imagine how frustrating it is to feel so out of control. But whatever you need to do to get through these next 4 days, without hurting yourself or others do it. "
"Thanks I wish the same for you. Just explain to the best of your ability. I think Therapists are trained to ""read between the lines"" somewhat and still might be able to see more than you ever could imagine. :)"
"That last line in particular, try and give him something to live for. He's likely being antagonised every day at school. If he thinks has nothing to lose then he will go on a spree, if not, he may call it off."
The simple answer is that they don't know any better.  You've had the opportunity to become educated and you see the immense value it adds to life and living.  They're in a dark cave and you've seen the light.
You are the only one insulting people. Confidence is not arrogance. That's your depression making you believe that so you see happy people as having a problem. Your depression makes you not like happy people.
You need to sit down with him and be blunt. Don't beat around the bush. Tell him that he needs to stop acting stupid. He can't take everything personally. Otherwise he'll continue making both of you miserable.
"&gt;6Posted byu/mvxn7 hours agoJust a reminder.  
  
All the shit you’re feeling is valid. Your flaws are beautiful. Don’t let others destroy you. Be your own best friend. It’s okay

I am so sorry for you be going through this right now.   And sorry that  your boyfriend could not get the help/healing he needed.  Give yourself some time to heal and process.  Pull back if you need to.  Seeing a therapist would be a good idea.  Wish you peace at this time.  "
"Exactly.  There have been so many things that I've questioned and resented for years but the answer always becomes clear.  This isn't to say that you should operate on autopilot though.  Actively look for ways you can create change and eventually something you'll be lead down another ""corridor"" in your life.  

Cat's are the best.  My cat is worth every penny of that hundred dollars I paid for him and then some.  The comfort he provides, however is priceless.  "
I can think of only two conversations that have happened that involved this talk that could have been overheard. In both cases I was asked about my problems because I'd suffered a small panic attack (nothing big or dramatic but it was obviously noticeable) and the colleagues in question were concerned about me and started asking questions which I was more than happy to answer. At no point have I approached anyone and forced them to listen to me out of the blue.

"Quick answer: No, you’re not a shitty person.

Long answer: Your concerns about your behavior may be completely valid. If you did something to someone that hurt them, they may not like you. This, in turn can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Where you say to yourself, I’m no good, I’m just a shitty person. And then you begin to do what a shitty person might do, this gets confirmed when people call you a shitty person, and then the vicious cycle repeats. "
"Thank you for your reply. I did indeed get fired..as expected :( But like you say, I have more leverage on going to the doctor now. The last few days has been really hard on my mental health. You're right, it was the illness and not really me. I'm not myself when I get like that.

I've currently been seeing a therapist, so can talk it through with her, and I'm going to try and get back in to the doctors as soon as I can. I'm determined to get over this hurdle. "
"Thank you, really. I’m actually feeling good- she was terminal but I have daily contact with my three sisters (fb messenger) and we chat about everything. We hold nothing back. ❤️

Healing from anything takes time and if it’s our brain, it’s even longer. People don’t understand because they can’t see it.

"The truth is, you dont know what's really going on in her head. School seems to be the obvious trigger for the suicidal thoughts.  Maybe there really is something going on that you dont know about. 

But I can also see how you would become skeptical. Just take everything with a grain of salt for now. She's young and going through puberty. 

Even if she's faking it, you need to take every suicidal threat seriously.  Because you never know when it might be real. "
"This are my thoughts im not on anyone's sides neither am i judging

He was happy with you because he had your attention and someone to talked to then your daughter was born and you stopped giving him any type of attention (even sex). This caused disassociation (which is emotional or physical detachment from the world). If thats the case it means he feels lonely and pressured to keep something that makes him dedicate his time but other dont dedicate time to him."

"Idk what I have tbh but enough appparently for my so to be worried and for the therapist to say after the first visit that I got something. It's flashbacks, weird ringing, some weird imaginings (?) of my skin being taken off,  suicide thoughts if I feel like I underachieve and physical ailments from stress and whatnot lol. Makes up for a wild cocktail gotta tell you. Also few weeks ago I felt bad enough for me to travel to a border of my country and hardly remembering most of it.

"Poutine, the behavior you describe for 10 years ago sounds ""psychotic"" or ""crazy.""  Both of those terms mean that you've lost touch with **physical** reality -- as occurred when you believed that someone was using Saturn's rings to magnetically manipulate your mind.

The human condition is that, whenever we experience intense feelings (e.g., strong fear or anger), our perception of other people becomes clouded and distorted.  That is true for all of us.  An important issue, then, is why your feelings have become so intense lately and why you are unable to regulate those feelings with coping skills."
"Depends on how trustworthy your coworkers are, and *especially* depends on how trustworthy your IT department is.  

In 99.999998% of situations, neither are going to be trustworthy enough to not make your mental health the office gossip of the week.  (And that remaining ~0.00000002% is due to a rounding error.) Or, rather than just gossip, once somebody in management hears about an employee with a mental illness they don't like, they could suddenly start enforcing all the little rules that everyone gets away with to start building an ADA-proof paper trail to fire them.  And the very supposed ""anonymity"" of the system would work against the ex-employee in that case, since they'll just argue at trial that management *couldn't* have targeted anyone because the system is perfectly anonymous.  

Then you have legal, ethical, and insurance issues coming up when someone expresses suicidal or homicidal ideation. 

Bad idea all around, however well intentioned it may be."
"So since I kind of vomited up the advice in a jumbled manner, I'll condense what I think are good avenues of improvement here.

 

Trying to get yourself to feel might not be the goal, but to seek out events and experiences that force you to feel stronger positive emotion. Concerts you really like, hikes up mountains, festivals, traveling with friends or maybe yourself etc. I found that learning an instrument helped me with a similar problem.

Exercise and meditation would be a good choice to both amplify positive emotion and break down your reflex of holding it back.

Maybe you can sometimes feel yourself holding back positive emotion, try and use your inner monologue to stop that.

Maybe get a pet to coax out the love.

Dating might help, hooking up with people.

 I'm basically just telling you to exercise, meditate, seek out the most  emotionally galvanizing experiences for positivity and try and loosen up when you catch yourself holding back positive emotion."
"We'll see. He's editing them as we speak so he already knows the outcome of all this. It's possible he's building the drama not just so people will continue to watch but because in the end, they wont have proved he is a sociopath and may not even believe it anymore after, which would be a good thing. All of his other series have been similar in a way, a lot of people hated Jefree Star then ended up liking him a lot after. Shane has that power and I believe he'll use it for good. I don't think his fans will use these videos as a reason to hate or stigmatize either but that's just a hope. Being more aware of mental illness and the sympthoms isnt ever a bad thing, I think. 

The one thing I will say is that I wish his Twitter interactions could be seen as much as his videos on this. He's corrected a lot and been really good about clearing up things there. Hopefully in the last part or in the beginning of another part he will include these thoughts and realizations. "
"I've seen a psychiatrist a few times a while ago, which is how I have this diagnosis. I've never seen anyone for anything else though. I declined her appointments so they took me off the list. I called her once this idea of suicide went from just a thought to a possibility a month ago, and she put me on the waiting list. Not messing with you, my appointment is in six months. I will not say where I live, let's just say our health care system can be a joke at times.  


Referring to what you said about this being normal and common, I'm not unhappy. This is a consistent boredom and void of enjoyment I've had my entire life. I'm extremely emotionally stable. Very little upsets me, and when I'm upset, it goes back to neutral very quickly. The downside being nothing makes me happy or excited. I'm almost 25 and it's been this consistently bland my entire life, you could see where I'm coming from not expecting anything to change. It's not that I haven't tried, I have, every thing I could think of. I've literally had years upon years to think about this and try new things, nothing helps and I'd be an idiot to think it would past this point.  


I appreciate you reaching out and trying to help; I just don't see it changing."
"First of all, sorry to hear you’re going through a tough time. Do you have anyone else you can talk to other than a GP or helplines? If not send me a message, I’ve been feeling alright recently and don’t mind chatting with someone who needs to talk. 

The problem is GPs are ill-equipped to handle mental health issues. The only practical thing they can offer is medication and mental health services are so choked there might not be anywhere they can refer you to except to community services. I’m not saying that to take away from the experience you’ve had (I’ve had some horrible appointments with my own GP over the last couple of months) but it’s kind of the reality with treatment through the NHS and it’s important for you to know what you’re dealing with.  

What’re you suffering from and what kind of help are you after? Without knowing more, the only thing I can suggest is contacting charities like Mind and seeing if there are any other avenues of support available to you that you might not have thought of or a GP hasn’t suggested. Also depending on where you are located there are private clinics that can offer low-cost treatment with trainees or charge fees on a sliding-scale. 

Finally if you’re experiencing any suicidal ideation or feeling the urge to self-harm perhaps A&amp;E is the best place for you. I know from my own experience that you’ll probably have to sit around for hours and not know what is going on, and I get the fear of being sectioned if you have it, but people won’t go through this unless they seriously need help so perhaps that’ll be what it takes for a doctor to take notice so you can get the help you need. Also you’ll be be safe, which is the most important thing!"
"Hey,

Sorry to hear that your struggling, like I said I'm no psychologist I can only draw from my personal experience and what I read during my own research. 

The reason I asked about the amphetamines is because I reacted completely different then my peers. Were regular people will usually get hyperactive, easily agitated, ect I would get clear headed. I was more in touch with my emotions and better at translating those feelings into words. Now the reason I asked is because most people with ADD don't get diagnosed. Well most I mean those who would have benefited from a diagnosis. 

ADD is basically ADHD for the brain. I can be following 4 different conversations at once at least I try to. I can contemplate/ worry about thoughts for hours without being able to stop it. Well into the night I could go to bed a 10 and mull about the most trivial stuff until 4, and have to get up at 6.  So why did I say most don't get diagnosed on time? 

It's because when nothing troublesome happens in their lives the mulling isn't a problem. Their mind is occupied with happy thoughts or maybe an hard maths problem. However for me and a lot like me we tend to overthink everything that went wrong years after the fact. We seem uninterested in people when they tell a story ( remember you might be talking to me but I'm still trying to follow 2 other conversations). This is important to know cause we usually get diagnosed at either these 2 pionts.

1. When we seek help for an other mental health problem. Depression is pretty common. Since we precieve to not belong or have other problems that hinder us. 

2. And this is the worrying one and why I asked about amphetamins. Since we function better on stimulants it's not uncommon to get addicted. My psychologist used to work in a rehab facility and this was pretty common. Since we don't know that our brains function differently we don't realize that we have an issue. We just think we are outcast and on amphetamins we fit in. 

Now that was a lot off text not even concerning your problem. I suggest you talk to a doctor about it. It might be SED of don't take this the wrong way a vitamin D deficit. Actually most people who think they have SED just have a vitamin deficit. If you go to school or work indoors it's not uncommon to get little to no sun. If your sensitive to it simply taking vitamins during the winter helps. But again I'm no doctor. I highly recommend you make an appointment to get it checked out especially since it's a recurring problem."
"I understand your perspective and there's actually a big overlap in what we agree on. But I really feel that mental health is kind of a mystery to people who haven't experienced it or had a SO who has. Physical illness is so much easier to grasp. It is such a difficult thing to imagine unless you have a close relationship with it.

You talk about empathy - I think this tends to come more naturally to people who have suffered. And it has to be a two way street; my empathy makes me able to imagine what it must be like to be blinded by ignorance to all of this stuff. So if I tell somebody I have OCD and they react the way OP's boss did, I just put myself in their shoes and assume they didn't know any better and were genuinely trying to help.

At this point, I would educate them. Explain to them that it isn't at all how it's portrayed on TV. Give them some examples of what it does to me. It might be the first time anyone has explained it to them. Give them an opportunity to fix their ignorance by listening.

If they apologise and react in a way that shows that something has actually changed for them, then that's a positive outcome. They'll be more sensitive in future, and maybe even help to fix other people's ignorance.

If they don't react well or they act the same way again, it's another story. That means there's a problem at the company that needs to be addressed - I would probably contact the HR department and ensure that it's taken seriously. It is not acceptable for somebody to treat employees this way if they have had the situation explained to them.

I also wouldn't criticise anyone for going directly to HR if they didn't have the energy to try to educate this person. That's a totally legitimate solution.

So I think we mostly agree. Where we perhaps disagree is on the idea that there is no excuse to not understanding mental health issues. I really think that there are many valid excuses. Unless it's impacted you in life, an average person probably isn't going to spend time imagining that something is anything other than what has been portrayed in the media. They think they already know what it is, so why challenge that idea? I think that is excusable. Not everyone is a hero in that way. If they don't respond to education, that's when it stops being excusable, in my opinion.

Of course if you think it is more effective to judge people more harshly then that's your call and I'm not trying to tell you how you should fight your fight. I haven't lived your experiences."
"&gt; Has anyone else dealt with this situation, where a medication and dosage wore off in efficacy?

Not uncommon.  Me, I switched medications since the higher doses always seem to turn me into Mr. Potato Head."
"As mentioned, she lives in Connecticut and I live in Chicago, so I can't physically go with her to a therapy session. I've tried asking for it as a favor, but that hasn't had any success. Thanks for your input."
"Holy shit I relate. I can go all day pretending I’m fine and I might even think I’m ok, but sometimes there will be one person who can see through it, and if they acknowledge it, I go from zero to sobbing. "
"I agree, my family is useless to talk to because they are all religious ish. 

I’m fairly certain thinking is a double edged sword. On one side its kind of neat. On the other you make very grim realizations. "
"I can relate to the life slipping by part. It hurts. I don't know what to say, I'm not really the one to speak. But I'm hurting to. I hope someone has some good advice for you man, I just thought I would reply."
I recently started working in an office after a LONG time (nearly ten years) working from home. Was really nervous about it but it's honestly done wonders for my anxiety. Hope you get the same kind of benefits!

It happens quite frequently, actually. "
"Look up farmers walks.  I love to fill a couple of 5 gal. bucked with rocks and carry them as far as I can, rest and then go again till I am exhausted ... also a good metaphor for letting g of emotional weight."
"No, someone with social skills would think so.

""Hmm, what's more effective as a solution to my relationship problem? Become hostile and escalate the situation or actually talk to my partner? ***HMMMMMMMM***."" "
"Thanks for your input - I know anything is possible, but I don't think he's likely to hurt anyone but himself.  He is persistent in reaching out, but he is not violent or angry.  I'll still be careful though.  "
That’s good I really want to get back to that point when shit was tolerable. I’ll have to fish around and find a therapist that actually gets me. Drinking definitely doesn’t help it makes it so much worse
This world is really something. A stranger who I've never met can care more than friends I've known for years. It's not sarcastic ethier. You just made me realize there are good people in this world. Thank you
What if you got connected with someone from someone from a different company who is working as a same profession as you and same industry? Then you wouldn't have to worry about your own company seeing the data.

"You could be an empath or intuitive. I’m not quite as sensitive as you are but I also have those problems which is why being around people can be very exhausting, especially if people have negative emotions. "
"Im only explaining be aware of that

Hallucinations = they will seem and youll think they are real it leads to delusion it needs to be medicated 
Derealization = the world seems fake to you, it doesn't need medication. You distrust what everyone tell you therefore you create your fantasy world

BPD people usually make up stuff to be seen to others as important

It cannot be treated by a psychiatrist only a therapist can work it out but you need to acknowledge it"
"Make sure you get a CT scan,  genetics tests, and even ask for a Pet scan to rule out anything serious if you're experiencing those types of symptoms. Get a full work up including blood tests.  I suffer from night terrors as well,  along with PTSD, severe panic disorder and extreme anxiety.  I would continue to stress your concerns for the hallucinations. It could all be anxiety related but to make sure  I would get testing done if you haven't already done so.  "
"People who do that probably enjoy walking all over people in general. They try to assert dominance, likely because they feel insecure about certain areas of their life.

I've recently stopped being ""Mr. Nice Guy"", and started putting people in their place. It's uncomfortable, but at this point I really don't give a fuck. I'd much rather die with a backbone than without one. The harder they try to treat me like a door mat, the more uncomfortable I will make them."
"Tell how? Not all massage therapists can tell, hell not all regular therapists can tell. It’s also out of my scope to ask or discuss trauma with clients except in regards to how our work together may help them feel in touch with their body more, something trauma may have taken away. I’m sure I’ve had lots of clients who I had no idea what they were going through, and I’ve had others who were more obvious—crying on the table, offering their story, etc. "
The panic feelings was so much worse before I was on the meds yes but one of the weaning off side effects that i have read is increased anxiety due to your body ajusting. Ive read forums after forum of people coming off and having increased anxiety and jumping straight back to the meds. The reason I want to come off them is the fact that I dont want to be on medication that makes me feel like a zombie anymore. I used to take amitriptyline and that was dreadfull
"I have twin older brothers that I would play with, never had any sexual feelings.

The only time I can think of where I thought a younger person was attractive, but that was because they looked like they were in my age group and I mistook them for being older than they actually were (I was actually kinda distressed when I found out). 

I have enjoyed played with younger kids before (family friends). I was not physical with them in any capacity and I never had any sexual thoughts concering them. When my anxiety was really bad, My dad reassured me by comparing me to Holden Caufield in the catcher in thr rye and my mom observed that I would do so because I wanted to be a big brother (I am the youngest in my family)."
"It may make it harder for the therapist to keep patient confidentiality. If you're talking about something he's spoken to your fiance about he may accidentally slip up and tell you something from their sessions and so he'll probably be working harder to try to keep confidentiality with both of you. It's also much harder for him to be unbiased about situations involving both of you, seeing as he's getting both sides of it. I'd say, if you can, find another good therapist, go to them instead. Also, though it's not an issue for you right now, at some point you may find the situation uncomfortable. I know I would, you want a therapist (unless it's couple or family work or whatever) to be for you and only you usually."
"Paolita, in adults, self harming like cutting is strongly associated with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  This is why it is one of the 9 defining symptoms for BPD.  I therefore suggest you speak with a psychologist or psychiatrist about this possibility.

If it applies to your situation, it means you had no opportunity in early childhood to acquire the coping skills needed to better control your own emotions. 

Fortunately, most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, CBT, and TFP) that teach adults how to acquire those missing skills.  If you don't have access to such programs, and if your psych determines your BPD traits are strong, I would recommend you acquire a DBT self help book."
"As I have said in the post, this assessment is only so I can effectively engage the majority of people who would be interested in my program. A single person cannot rely on their own opinion and knowledge to address a topic that is so large and stigmatized so I am asking people to state their stance on issues in mental health. I don't ask for personal information (all questions are simple - nothing you wouldn't say in public) and I won't use the information given for anything other than developing my program. If you don't want to take it, that is perfectly fine with me. But don't say I am phishing - I didn't even think about Reddit as a platform to post this (I rarely go on reddit), but a friend told me that there are genuine subreddits that are geared towards the betterment of our community especially our mental health community. I just want to make a difference. So if you think it's sketchy, move along and respectfully leave your comments to yourself. Thank you."
"Let me tell you, I have a disorder that is more often seen in teenage/young adult males, and it had laid dormant for 2-1/2 decades or more. One little thing triggered it inside my mind and it came out full-force. I can't stop myself now and I don't know why it would be triggered so easily now, of all times. These things don't discriminate and don't have a time-line. There may have been a trigger you didn't even realize, and there ya go. I am also on a waiting list for therapy...and I really need it also. My compulsions/urges can be quite destructive to property and people if I let it get out of control. I can control it now but I fear in the future it will just grow and grow (it already has gotten worse just a smidge) and make me damage someone's property or someone's life. :( That won't be good. 

Good luck in therapy. Make sure you (and myself!) are absolutely honest with the therapist so he/she can help you through this tough time. Lots of love coming your way!"
"Nothing profound that’s stuck in my head, but I know the thought has crossed my mind often. Unfortunately there’s also moments where I wish I did succeed, I hate to be negative but it’s true. There’s a mix of good and bad moments that make me look back to that day. But as it is with the positive, it’s the same with the negative, nothing so profound that I’ve attempted again but nothing so amazing either.

Nonetheless, I’m glad I didn’t succeed. I’m happy I’m here, I’m happy I made it over that mountain. What pushed me to that point is way behind me now, but my mental health issues still leave me to struggle with the hardships I face. Now I have the strength to push through instead of just trying to quit.

You gotta have faith, let it be in God, yourself, music, humanity. You just have to have faith. Mine is in the universe, karma, the energy of everything and everyone around me. I know there’s bad out there but there’s also a lot of good."
"That does help a little bit. My therapist does know about a lot of this.  In fact, I put in a request to talk with her again soon.  I need to get her to nudge the actual psychological doctor about switching my medication for sleep to something that actually helps me relax, so I can have that rejuvenating, refreshing, and relaxing sleep that I've not been getting for many years, especially since I was diagnosed with migraines back in 2001/2002.

As for phone calls, I know that's something that needs work.  It didn't help that when I was growing up, the local &amp; long distance rates for using the phone, even for a local call, became expensive.  My late dad was always harping all of us about using the phone for non-urgent matters.  My mother was the biggest offender calling her mom or other family relatives upwards of 10 times a day @ 40 minutes a pop.  At even $0.25/minute, that became my dad's biggest complaint that our phone bill was expensive, and of course, for me to call long distance to a one-time friend was ridiculously hard.

Anyway, I get what you're saying.  And I will be following up with my mental health team, including my therapist who has a file folder an inch thick just for me alone. LOL ����"
"Ah I see. Well I suggest you direct this question to your doctor. If the disease is known to have effects on areas of the brain associated with balance then sure, why not, but definitely ask you doctor about it."

"I haven't done this (Luminosity), but I have done biofeedback, which might be similar. The biofeedback helped me focus a lot better, made my mind stop racing all the time, and made me calmer. Hope that helps. :)"
"I won't be able to get an appointment until next month if I get lucky and someone cancels. So, I'll try to remember to ask. I'll just have to be mindful to not panic too much to where I get out on a watch list. "
"I'm a research doctor, not a medical doctor, so ignore my advice. I'm not trying to get you to keep taking the drug. Have you taken any laxatives? Merely taking a laxative isn't enough to get you addicted to it."
"If you can ask the question “am I a narcissist” then it’s highly likely that you’re not one. NPDs lack the ability to have any awareness of self, which you clearly have as you’re asking the question :)"
Is it normal for a therapist to explain upfront their methods and philosophy? And to explain what they're trying to do as we go along? Or is it normal for a client to have to ask before having those discussions?
Lol you made me chuckle. I was just up in the woods burning random shit. Got some cardboard going good but everything is too wet still to really burn. I was diagnosed not long ago and I'm learning to accept it.
"My sister's ex.  He said, ""Look it can't be something every day.  That is mental illness"".  Looks like he was right.

My sister's mother (we have the same father) died in a mental institution.  So there's that. "
Sometimes it's nice to put it out there. But it also makes me feel weak after. People don't give a shit about others or their problems.. They might pretend. But on the real. We're all on our own. And it's a mess
"Sorry to hear that, don't think too much of it. 

If you can get back to meds, do it. Even get therapist.

I'm no professional, but I give you emotional support. If you wish for a chat. I can comply.

Good luck!"

You need to schedule an appointment with a doctor. They'll be able to get you a referral to see a psychiatrist. And also a therapist as well. You need help. And you need to take care of this as soon as possible.

"Being in love has nothing to do with being together forever. Relationships begin and come to an end. Love is living underneath it all, never dying, never breaking. Love cannot fail. It is unique in every moment you shared. That means, you will never be replaced. There isn’t anything in this world that could replace you. The pain is hell, but the world isn’t against you, remember that.

These are just some thoughts, feel free to burn anything you disagree with"
"Going to a therapist is your choice. You don't have to see a therapist if you don't want to. Taking a break or stopping altogether could be more helpful in some cases, especially if you've had bad experiences with therapy. You mentioned you've been doing well, so I don't see any issues with stopping. There are competent therapists out there who aren't condescending, as I'm sure you understand, but unfortunately, it can take several tries to find the right one. 

"
"I had to come back to work, and it was exactly like that. On top of that, first day I came back, no one came to see me. I mean, my boss didn't come to see me, neither someone from the HR department. I didn't have a note from my ""on holliday"" colleague, nor an email... I didn't have any informations on what has been done or what has to be done. 
I had to present myself to my new colleague that no one introduce me to.
So, I sorted my emails and then clean my desk.

"I’d try doing this and seeing if you’re feelings change through talking about it. Everyone’s life situation is different, so even though it’s natural to try to compare, it never really works properly. 

If you give it a try and still don’t feel comfortable with her, I’d probably switch. Even though it could be productive to keep exploring that, you’ve got to feel comfortable with your therapist (IMO) to have a good working therapeutic relationship. "
"Thank you so much for your response and kind words. I have already made lists (5 pages of notes....eek) but I will do my best to refrain from reading from them and be more in the moment. 
A lot of my issues are linked to my past/childhood. Therapy is definitely something I’m looking forward to, I want more than anything to be okay. 

I’m so glad therapy helped you! I will stay committed, which is something I definitely struggle with, but it’ll be worth it. "
"if he's is depressed and suicidal then professional help will be needed. Getting him a good therapist is very helpful and give him this number 1-800-SUICIDE (784-2433) and it'll connect with a depression treatment center in your area. I'm not the best for advice, but remember to always be a good listener and to not say ""you know what he's going through"" cause chances are, you don't. I hope this helps and really consider getting him the professional help he needs."
"Probably the best thing you can do for her is to listen and be there. Since you have experience yourself you might be able to give her advice but it would only work if she asks for it or otherwise indicates that she's receptive to it. Mostly she probably wants to feel understood and not alone.

It is good that you are being there for her, but even though she probably isn't trying to do this, she's putting you in a difficult position with what she's saying. The boundaries are entirely personal and you have to decide what you are comfortable with. You must balance your desire to be a caring friend with your own needs. Pay attention to how you are feeling and whether this is impacting your own life in a negative way."
"Sometimes we compact our emotions like trash. Sure it's smaller and a lot easier to hide away but the smell is still there. It's possible instead of dealing with the feelings you might have just shoved them away so you could move on. If you think this is possibility I suggest you take some time to reflect on what you felt and more importantly why you felt them. It's also important to remember that it is in the past and you can't change them but they are a valid part of who you are. If you start feeling depressed and anxious about it, that's a good sign but again they are valid and in the past. You're not less of a person for having felt the things you may feel. 

Old hidden away emotions can stagnant the present. "
"I’ve been on zoloft 75mg for over a year now. I find zoloft to be pretty good. I take it for OCD, anxiety and depression. Some of my side effects include:
1. If I drink in extremely minimal amounts (I’m talking like a shot of vodka), I get SO tired and act like I’m black out drunk. 
2. If I miss just ONE dose of zoloft, I go into a panic mode (panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, extreme anxiety) 
3. I have gained about 10lbs from zoloft.. I was about 105lbs when I started it, now I’m 115lbs
4. I sometimes don’t feel like myself on zoloft.. I feel like I’m almost a fake person. Almost as if my emotions are fake and I’m being controlled way too much emotionally by the medication (idk if that makes sense but)
5. Strange dreams like very very vivid strange dreams
But other than that, I’ve found zoloft to be amazing compared to Lexapro and Celexa (I’ve tried almost every SSRI under the sun) in a sense that it keeps me emotionally stable.
Best of luck!!

"You're okay, promise that it will get better. The hardest thing about mental Ill health is that 'stuck' feeling it gives you. But know this; time continues to pass and naturally we grow and change with it, it's inevitable. Even if we don't try, things will change.
My favourite part about growing older is the perspective shift that just comes naturally from being alive. You can't predict what or who you'll be or how you'll think, which is the best. 

Tell someone. If it's a friend, just tell them you need someone to listen, and then tell them everything you're feeling. Talk to a professional, either online (eheadspace) or in person. Or call a hotline. 

You're not alone. You do have the power to help your mind get unstuck, but it will take time. It's not overnight, think of it like exercising. One push up won't give you biceps, but if you go to the gym everyday you'll slowly start seeing results.
Talking about it won't fix it immediately, but sharing your story with others will make you feel less alone.
Talk. Exercise. Help a friend out (helping others helps us). Eat well. Let the bad thoughts come, and then let them pass. Keep writing out those feelings too. 
Much love to you - keep on keeping on. You've got this.

"Does anyone in your family have a history of depression? If you had the time to get enough sleep, eat something healthy, etc., would you want to play video games again?
Depression has a lot of different forms and it shows itself differently in a lot of people, but here a few common symptoms that may help you;
1. Persistent lethargy (sleeping until 4 in the afternoon and waking up tired every day you have off is an example)
2. A sense of loneliness that doesn't go away. You feel like no-one cares about no matter how many times your friends and family say they do care about you.
3. Loss of appetite. Sometimes just the thought of food and eating exhausts you.
4. Weight loss/gain. In depression, it is common for this to happen gradually. Sometimes, after a traumatic event that instigates/induces depression, it can happen suddenly. I'd be worried if you started dropping more than 10 lbs a month. 
5. Sadness (obviously). Can you remember the last time you felt happy? How long ago was that?
6. Persisting apathy. You don't care about the things around you anymore. Your goals mean nothing to you, your friendships mean nothing to you, etc. Apathy can also come in pieces throughout the day. The point is that you feel more apathetic than happy or motivated.

That's all that I can think of off the top of my head. Depression is a complicated thing and it doesn't have to be chronic. So even if your family doesn't show history of it, it's still possible for you to become depressed.

"I don’t think it’s narcissism as she tends to be very self conscious and emphasize what others say and think.

Several months ago we had company over for dinner and our friend was asking me what I’m doing in school. I told her that I’m studying psychology because it’s my passion and my mom chimes in, interrupting, and says “psychologists have the highest suicide rate out of all the health careers”. She then made a comment (in front of everyone) about how our friends step-daughter, who is 23, will be graduating college before me (in a very condescending way) 

Ironically, not long after I started going to the online school I’m currently trying to transfer out of, she signed up for it too (for a different degree). She ended up dropping out after 2 or 3 quarters. She said it was too hard to work full time and do that. She then made comments saying how she wishes SHE only had to work part time so she could go to school but she can’t because she has to work and has responsibilities (so she is unable to work full time and finish school, recognizes its difficulty, and then expects me to do it). I honestly don’t know. It’s hard because I feel like I’m always trying to figure out their psychological issues in order to ‘justify’ their/her words and behaviors toward me, which leaves me feeling very angry, and then I feel very guilty for feeling so angry because I can empathize with the things they’ve gone through that makes them the way they are.  "
"Two attempted suicides here. I'm better. 
Not perfect, not a bundle of joy, not particularly cheerful even, but I'm better than i was, and I'm getting better still.  

I know what you mean when you say you feel like you've always felt bad. Something horrible happens with anxiety and depression, it reaches back in your mind and poisons your memory, I feel like I have two different childhoods in my brain. When I am thinking straight I remember it normally, some good, some bad, pretty wierd and generally fun. When I'm in the pit all I can remember is feeling alone and staring terrified at the stars, wondering how everyone else got on with their lives when the world was such a horrifying void. You often remember what you are feeling right now, not what really happened. The same happens projecting forward, you feel awful, you think you will always feel awful, I get that. But try to be empiric about it, you know good things happen to you, remind yourself, create material reminders of good times, take photos and videos, wear a charm bracelet and add to it when something wonderful happens. Then when your brain tells you things are always going to be bad, look at it and say fuck you brain, I can enjoy myself and I can prove it. Your brain is a shit and it will try to trick you, but it can't re-write the world. 

Talk to your grad program, only the most sadistic asshat wont listen to you. There's always a decent human somewhere, they will help you or point you to someone who can. You would be kind to someone else, they will extend that kindness to you.  

Don't worry about multiple therapies, try stuff until something feels like its working and stick with it until you can't. Then find something else as soon as you can. Try something else, medicate or meditate or pray or rockclimb, there are no wrong answers if they help you. Failure feels like shit but its actually very fleeting, and if you get back up and try again you just earned another cool scar. Don't listen to that voice telling you that you have undone months of work because you missed a couple of weeks therapy, he'll try and get you to stay at home in the dark because he's scared your winning. 

 I know losing people is scary, we'll all be here no matter what. 
Good luck "
"But it's a nice place to live!

I _think_ it's probably just the fact that it's cheap accommodation that accepts people living off benefits, who are more likely to suffer from some form of mental illness I guess."
I do see a therapist. The only thing I can think of is the stabbing back in March. I'm still living in the flat where the stabbing occurred. Maybe it's affecting in more ways than just my ability to get to sleep.
"I had tiredness during the day
Insomnia at night
Confusion and hard to express my feelings in words
But as soon as went back on the seroquel I felt much better 
I think /hope you will feel better as time goes on
"
"I watched it and it makes sense but I always feel like people aren't social awkward as much as me etc

All the negative experiences of the past kinda messed me up so as the video said I focus more on the negative"
"Idk if this is true in your area, but near me there’s a lot of people going to see psychiatrists after all the school shootings, so I’m kinda glad that I have to wait but kinda not because I have to wait lml "
"It is alarming if a child that young is self harming. Something is not right.. I personally would contact child protection, or something.. No child would think like that unless something really bad is happening.."
I’m really on a budget as of now but I have thought about it. Obviously that would be worth my money but I don’t really know which to buy or if it will really help me. So far I’ve only done research online.
"Mental illnesses can affect cognition. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913637/ I have this problem, also, and have noticed my memory failing more and more over the years, to the point it's alarming."
No problem. Wow. That is REALLY like my Aunt. This makes me sad because I have heard about my Aunt from my cousin and all the episodes she has just like this...it is so sad to hear. :( I send you and her huggles!
Nothing. If she's treating you poorly then she's not worth the heartache. I understand that she might slip back into depression. But is the abuse really worth it? I don't think so. But this decision is up to you.
"Remember this is just a phase/stage will not be forever. What's we believe what we get. So try keep it mind. Also, looking for help &amp; sharing your thoughts here that means You're the smart who will not fall. "
"Right, but the computer can't work out whether or not the questions affected the outcome. The only way you could do that would be to re-ask the survey with unbiased questions and see if you get the same results. "
"Unless if your health problem is due to substance abuse, then no.

Usually the advise here is not to take it personally but, hell, its hard not to. 

Words hurt, and some people just never seem to undertand this "
"&gt; This morning, they tell me they will have to kick me out if I do not go in accordance to the psychiatrist's medical recommendation.

Happened to my sister as well.  They wanted her to choose a complimentary therapy: physical therapy, aqua therapy, acupuncture, tai chi, almost anything.  My sister kept putting them off; one excuse after the other.  To be honest, she just wanted the pills.   They gave her one final 30 day refill and dismissed her as a patient. "
"Definitely sounds like a form of OCD. If he tries to actively cover it up though, he may already have been diagnosed/know he has it, he just might be a little embarrassed. In all honesty if you’re really close friends, I say just ask him about it.

If he’s open and willing to talk about it you can express your concern. If he seems embarrassed or not ready to talk about or acknowledge it just reassure him you’re there if he ever needs you, and then drop it. 
"
I don’t want to give a diagnosis but maybe this will help you a bit: People with ptsd don’t always get “typical” flashbacks. Some experience emotional flashbacks where the body kind of re-experiences the emotions you felt while the traumatic event was happening. How old were you when it happened? Young children often times can’t remember enough to experience a flashback with e.g. pictures but they can relive the emotions (like extreme fear and anxiety).
"Phobias are similar, I wouldn't dismiss the therapist that fast. 
It actually seems a more reasonable fear than some others, because we tend to get scared from the vast unknown naturally.

While scared, don't forget though that it means hope also. No matter how bad it gets, there's always this mysterious possibility that we just completely misunderstand this world and that things are actually fine, that it all makes sense if we could see the big picture of it all "
"You can wait for it to pass of course, or you could try shining some light on it by keeping a dream diary. Basically when you wake up from a dream you write down what you remembered before going back to sleep. Not a pleasant exercise if it's a nightmare but it could give you insight.

A therapist who knows you well could probably pinpoint the root cause if you give them this diary. Otherwise you're pretty much on your own to figure it out, but it's still possible."
"I definitely think you should. My last job fizzled out because I had some issues oversleeping and making it in. I was really depressed and constantly calling out and leaving as early as I could. I was making so many excuses for myself because I was too afraid to talk about my mental health issues. I really regret that and wish if I could’ve done it the right way I would’ve. I didn’t tell any of my coworkers and I’m not sure I would’ve but I do think I should’ve told my manager. Mental health is so hard to manage sometimes and it isn’t your fault when you can’t give it your all. I’m sure your manager knowing will only help you, as they will be more understanding of your situation/ time needed off. "
"I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at, but I'll take a stab at it.

The cost will vary - it may mean changing your life in ways that are uncomfortable or inconvenient, it may mean letting go of some friends or opening up to new friends (or in new ways to existing friends), it may mean admitting things to yourself that are uncomfortable and allowing other people to know some of those things (don't let other people know what is not comfortable for you - this is a process, not a to do list). It may mean changing your habits - exercise is a great thing if you can add it (it helps your brain too), focusing on what you include/exclude from your general routine can also help, meditation is a secondary (and lower intensity) partner - you can get free help from headspace or insight timer, also just think about your daily habits - want helps your mental health and wellbeing, what doesn't? Focus on the stuff that helps you, even if it is challengining in the short term."
"I’m so happy someone mentioned mindfulness and CBT. CBT has helped my anxiety at work decrease so much. In my personal life, I’m still working on it; however, having CBT take the load off the anxiety for work was a huge improvement. 

I also have tried to keep up doing 5-10 mindfulness minutes a day. 

I’ve also found that when I’m feeling anxious and the paranoia is becoming too much I audibly tell myself “You are feeling anxious, and that is okay. You don’t have to feel anxious. You will be okay, and [whatever issue] will be resolved.” I started doing this, because any time I was paranoid and knew logically that it was unreasonable, or maybe even not reality, I would start really hating myself. Self-hate obviously does not bode well for mental health, especially when combined with depression and anxiety. Telling myself that it’s okay what I’m feeling has really helped me end the self-hate cycle. I hope that the tips above and below can help you! "
"I spent a long time being against the idea of trying medication. Now I'm a fair bit older than you and I've changed my mind because I've been in the same loop for 20 years at least.

Try to be open minded about medication. It could be just what you need. If you don't like it, you can stop taking them. You can write a journal to keep track of things if you're worried. But try to think of it like moving to a new country. You're still you, but you feel different due to your surroundings.

I can relate to the feeling of being split - loyal to those who support you but still wanting to die. It's horrible because it pulls you in two directions at once. It's exhausting.

It sounds like you could do with getting out of your own head a bit. Maybe try physical pursuits as well as your writing? Or at least other hobbies that don't make you reflect on your life so much.

And try to be honest with the professional help. The more you tell them, the more they can help you. There's no point keeping secrets from them. It's not like they haven't heard it before.

Hope you start feeling a bit better soon. Sounds like you have a lot to live for. Much more than some. When you do feel better, make the most of the good things in your life."
"LCSW here, who works with ADHD **a lot**, pre-school to adult.  PTSD can cause all of that.  But, so can ADHD, particularly if you were never taught skills for *your* particular difficulties (inattention, forgetfulness, lack of focus, hyperactivity, etc). Anger is a very common ""presenting problem"" for a client with ADHD.  

You didn't mention this, but they're fairly common and research is really coming out in the last 5-10 years about TBIs. Any severe concussions or head injuries?  I'm asking because, in mental health, we're always trained to rule out medical issues first, and, again, concussions are semi-common.

Last thing, rhetorically, just to present possibilities: you mentioned the anger issues separately from the ADHD.  It sounds as though the anger goes back pretty far, possibly pre-wife.  Childhood really does shape who we become as adults.  Did something(s) from childhood contribute to your anger/hatred towards these particular groups/types of people? Or, was there a traumatic event that occurred?

You may not have done it the best way.  But, **kudos** to you for opening up to your wife and sharing about your feelings! That's not an easy thing to do.  And, you're looking for answers.  You're taking steps."
"I would be considering definitions of what actually constitutes 'self harm' .

&amp;#x200B;

From what I read, correct me if Im wrong, you are just using electric shocks to create painful sensations, which you find therapeutic.

&amp;#x200B;

Im assuming from what youve said, that there is no permanent damage caused by the activity?

&amp;#x200B;

If you're not damaging your body or your physical health, and the activity is sustainable in terms of not causing harm in the long term of its use, then no demoonstrable 'harm' as such, so probably no issue?

&amp;#x200B;

I would be worried though, if, for example, you were getting some kind of physical damage to the area you're using it, or, for example, if the activity was exacerbating a heart condition, or damaging nerves, or  something like that. Then yes, maladaptive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im trying to make a clean break in the distinction between 'pain' and 'harm', where 'pain' may well be doing you good (from what you say, it certainly is), and 'harm' may be damaging you.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope I havent misunderstood, and really glad, if I havent, that you've found something that works for you and is not physically dangerous. God knows, its hard for many of us to do that, and if you have, then thats great.

&amp;#x200B;

The folks over at /r/sexover30 may have some sage input on this. There are a lot of very cluey people there on pain/pleasure/mental wellbeing (even if you're not in the age group).

&amp;#x200B;

All the best"
"one thing that really helps me is knowing that i don't have to be perfect every day. part of recovery is pushing myself to do more things, even if they scare me. therapy and treatment and that constant push to recover and stay well... it's all very very important, but it's sooooo good to be able to say to my husband ""i need to rest today"" and he'll just take care of me and let me rest and trust that i'll pull myself together and go back to fighting the next day. taking care of myself in that way is really important too, and that's a skill i've had to learn (because i used to panic, thinking things like... if i'm not pushing myself EVERY DAY then am i really trying to get better? do i really deserve any help if i'm not even trying???). but yeah, it's important to take breaks and to let myself relax when i need it as well. 

so i guess the most important thing you can do is offer unconditional support ... help her fight off all the things dragging her down, encourage her to do things when she can, but don't forget to let her take a day off if she needs it too. recovery is never straightforward ... sometimes you have a run of good days and you're like ""great! i'm better now! i can do anything i want!"" and then it hurts *so much more* when you have a bad day and can't even function. 

i hope your wife makes a speedy recovery and that she never experiences something like this again, but if it does become more long-term then she is lucky she has someone as supportive as you by her side. :) 

in terms of practical activities - i'd start small, the sorts of things you'd do with someone who has a serious physical illness (resting at home, watching movies, maybe some board games, making her some comfort food (soup?), ordering takeout and eating together at home) and then gradually stepping up the activities to be more difficult or complicated as her mental health improves (walking in the park, going out on dates, low-stress hobbies she enjoys). If you're not sure if she's ready to handle an activity, you can ask her and be ready with something more low-key if she turns it down. Even if she says it's alright, you can make it clear that it's okay if she needs to go home at any time, like if it gets more difficult than she expected. "
"I feel like we're twins. I completely understand and have felt all the things you're describing and struggled with them myself. You're struggling with both depression and anxiety (which often go hand-in-hand as one causes the other) and you really need to reach out and make appointments with your primary to start the process of getting help and getting better. Have you ever heard the saying: *Nothing changes if nothing changes.* I learned that during my first psych stay and it really stuck with me. If you want to get better, you have to force yourself to start taking steps to get better or nothing will change. Do you want to stay stuck and be in the same position in 5, 10, or even 20 years? I doubt it. So do something about it and start by making the small steps I've already mentioned.

1. Make a primary care appointment so you can get checked out and get a referral to a therapist and psychiatrist. Talk about your depression and anxiety with your primary and they can test you for certain things that could impact it, like hormones, vitamin levels, thyroid or adrenal problems, etc.

2. Open up to your family. I know it's not easy but you must have at least one family member you feel the closest to. Your family needs to know what's going on so they can support you and be understanding of your situation. I know how hard it can be which is why it's often easiest to pick one person to talk to first.

2. Do something every day that puts you out of your comfort zone, even if it's something as small as saying hello to a stranger or giving someone a compliment.

3. Exercise daily. I know how hard it is at the beginning but force yourself to at least walk around your neighborhood every day and build up from there. Make sure to get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day and you will notice a difference in your depression, it just may take a little while.

4. If you're eating junk or crappy food, change your diet. Many people don't realize that your happy brain chemicals (like serotonin) come from food and if you're eating crappy food, you won't get the happy chemicals your brain needs. Try to cut out all processed foods and eat as much whole foods as you can. If you eat dairy or animal products, avoid dairy, eggs, or meat with added hormones as that can throw everything off too. There are certain foods that are high in 5-HTP which is the chemical that turns into serotonin in your body. I know cherries are very good to increase serotonin. Here's a [link](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/foods-that-could-boost-your-serotonin) that mentions some other foods that increase serotonin. You may also want to start taking a probiotic as that can help increase serotonin and other happy chemicals but that's up to you. If you do decide to start a probiotic, make sure you only get one that's refrigerated as 90% of non-refrigerated ones don't work and are a waste of money. I personally like [Garden of Life probiotics](https://www.gardenoflife.com/content/product-category/products-for-life/probiotics/all-probiotics/).

5. *Optional* Get a pet if you don't already have one or if you aren't allergic. I can't stress enough how helpful pets can be for emotional support and how much better they can make you feel.

I wish you weren't so far away (I live in Massachusetts) or maybe we could be friends. I'm a female about 10 years older than you and I've been exactly where you are now and want to help.

What do you think about everything I've said? Have you started to take any of the steps yet?"
"All the ""professionals"" I talked to were expensive as hell but not so ""professional"". One of them used to ignore the *chance* that i could have a disorder. I've wasted tons of money on therapists and doctors. Fml."
"Glad to know Death is always there for me.

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously same offer if anyone ever needs help hit me up. I've been at the bottom of depression before I can try to help as I slowly get better myself."
"How many more times do you think you'll be reposting this same link to this same survey on the same subreddits?  What specific answers are you looking for?

At the very least, please label your reposts as reposts."
"I am going to get flak for this, but please don't get angry for what he did, The world's gene pool is super fucked up now and mental illness in in massive numbers, PLEASE just be there for him and don't judge him."
I completely relate to this. I’ve never really heard of anyone else struggling with this and I’ve never told anyone for the fear of them thinking I was crazy. It is nice to see someone else experiencing this.
I do. I wish I knew how to get rid of them. The only time I don't have them is when I smoke the devils lettuce or am drunk. And that sucks. I heard drinking a cup of red wine before bed helps. Haven't tried it yet
"I don't know anything about romanticizing mental health issues. But at a point, we no longer know our true selves. We no longer know how it feels to be alright because yes our demons hold us when nobody else does."
I had to learn that hardly anyone cares how I am. There are some exceptions thankfully who really care but most don't. I usually ask to see how the other side is doing as to know if I have to avoid certain things.
I think it’s better to be honest about how you feel. If you tell people how you’re really feeling they might be able to help in some way. And sometimes just telling someone and getting it out can be a relief.
"I went through a divorce, I know how you feel. Just flat out depression.. I never thought i'd get over him until i met my current husband. You will find the one who is perfect for you. It helps to let it all out. "
"I've never used it before so I'm not too sure honestly. Face to face interactions though would probably be much better. But if betterhelp.com is your only option, then it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to try it."
"It's all about the little steps, you will overcome today ❤️�� If managing is key to the process I am sure you are already on the path with your psychologist to achieve it. I send you tons of love and hugs!"
Ive been distracting myself since 5 am. Its 1 pm here now and I am rubbing out of distractions. I guess thats why I posted. To find another distraction. Thank you for believing in me when I cant believe in myself
"Sorry, yes 200 was a different med. I was on 30mg but was taken off as it had no clear effect positive or negative. 
Citalopram is falling out of favour with doctors, venlafaxine or setraline usually tried first. "
"The side effects in the very beginning were definitely unpleasant for me and I almost stopped taking it, but I’m really glad I stuck with it. I just feel normal now, but a better normal if that makes sense lol. "
"There isn't something wrong with you. This is just what life is. It can be shitty and difficult. Make some distance between you and your mom, two angry people will only bounce off more angry energy to each other. "
These would be good questions/concerns to bring up with your doctor. Generally the specific effect of meds on a person can't really be predicted well because it's so individual and people can react so differently.
"Yeah, it’s rough. I don’t know much about your situation but I can say for certain that I’m way happier in my new relationship. It’s good to know that you’re the most important thing in someone’s life."
"You should look into getting some EMDR therapy. It specialises in uncovering traumatic memories bit by bit to enable your brain to process overwhelming events, even those that occurred when you were really young. "
"And to add to this very thoughtful comment... you can always call the police and have them do a wellness check where they basically stop by the house and check up on them. I, unfortunately, have had to do this many times with an ex bf. While he just angrily told them to go away, it gave me peace of mind when he wouldnt answer his phone and was texting me about suicide. Hang in there, this is a tough situation but it is manageable. Much luck to you and your family! "
"I don't think awareness of mental health disorders is growing. People still would have no idea why their colleague hasn't showered for a week or is self harming, and they still probably don't understand why someone might start having a panic attack in a library or a whilst doing their weekly shop. However, I do think that awareness of mental health (as opposed to mental illness) has increased and the things people can do to improve/maintain their mental wellbeing. "
"I would become annoyed with this very quickly, and someone would get told in no uncertain terms to stfu. One further offense would result in an epic dennis leary style rage rant, possibly a bitchslap. My tolerances are at an all time low lately, I lost it on some lady at McDonalds because she was hassling a staff over her coffee not being the perfect color. Long story short, I ended up with her coffee. And it was fucking delicious.

Take care, and good luck to you."
"In the U.S it is far worse. Especially if someone wanted to join your military or police force they would be precluded from doing so with any sort of mental health diagnosis. You may not have a roster yet but a few more years of mass shootings they may decide to make one (since the blame usually falls on the mentally ill when a shooting happens). 

As far as `re-diagnosis` they will not allow it. All mental health conditions are permanent unlike physical ailments. "
"Indeed. You are most likely correct. I guess we'll have to see if perhaps things change back. It may be that they go back to normal as quickly as they came, but if not we may have to simply ask him. It does bring up lots of questions about our relationship with our brother though. The only reason we haven't asked him so far is that he is the kind of person which would take offense or feel threatened if we were to ask him directly, he may even dismiss it completely."
"Is there any possible way to request shifts where the two of you don't overlap? Or, if it's an office, could you request a space far away from them? That sounds like a tough situation. Have you ever retaliated to their abuse (verbally called them out on their shit), or do you just listen and stay quiet? Sometimes bullies can be thrown off once they realize the victim isn't going to take their shit-- they will often find someone else to take their aggression out on."
"It might help to have a massive writing session where you get all your experiences and feelings down on paper, then go back and try to edit it into something you can share with a therapist on a first visit - just like an overview, the broad strokes. You can get into details later.

It always helps me to write things down before my appointments with my psychiatrist and therapist.

I'm sorry you've been having such a rough time. I hope things get better for you soon!"
"yeah of course it goes both ways, no one should have to tolerate disrespect in what’s supposed to be a loving relationship i fully agree. if you don’t respect your partner then why be with them? it’s harmful for both people involved, i’m glad you got out of that relationship, some people are just so inconsiderate even if you yourself are a caring person who would never do anything to hurt the person you love, it’s really sad and it happens far too much :/"
"Find a therapist. You can go to your college's counseling center for free. But you definitely need a therapist. It seems like this is something you really need to talk this over with someone and get it out of your system. If you don't and you continue not being g able to properly eat, sleep, etc., you may get really sick physically.

But I also want to say that no matter how your parents feel, there's nothing wrong with being gay (or possibly bi). You're going to be ok, even if your family doesn't accept you for who you are. Take it slow though! Don't bombard your family before they're ready or before you're ready for the potential fallout. Find friends and trusted people who can support you, along with a therapist."
"Hey bud. This happens alllll the time. Dont beat yourself up about it. Therapists know it can take a while for patients to really open up. It took me like 3 appointments before I started warming up to my therapist, even though I’d consider myself very in-tune with my emotions. 

Anyways I’d highly recommend starting a journal if you don’t do it already, it’s super beneficial to bring to therapy; label days that you should probably talk to them about and any nagging obsessions or questions you may have about life. If you shut down in therapy or blank out on your issues literally just read from your journal. Good luck :) 

PS also recommend checking out r/thesmallvictories it’s a super encouraging community "
"I wonder if your son is really scared that he could get sick again.  There’s a lot out of his control: cat getting fleas, having to have surgery, etc.  maybe this obsessive checking is a way to make sure he’s in control of something.  He can’t control if he has to have emergency surgery again (which is terrifying) but he can control if there are bugs in his food or on him.  Poor guy.  Sounds like everyone is handling it well and it’s been a tough couple weeks for him.  I’d take him to a therapist (not a psychiatrist initially) so he can talk about how he’s feeling about everything and how much the bug checking is bothering him.  If the therapist thinks he needs meds, then they will refer him.  Good luck!"
"Sorry but some of what you said i don't understand, like i know what i enjoy and love, i am into fitness, combat sports and j like watching movies, i read about how important it is to have a hobby/interest.

But that didn't help me in anyway, i can find people having similar tastes bit i don't connect with them, i don't know if it makes any difference but i don't initiate talk or start conversations, i would wait for others.

And my anxiety kicks in if i see an attractive girl - being the center of attention - being judged upon (if verbally, then by someone staring at me).

I don't know why or what's the reason but it's like i want to have friends and know people, bit the more i want it, the more i become isolated. "
"Does your school have any counseling available? That is usually inexpensive.  

Other thoughts: have you googled “burn support group” or “trauma support group” to see if there is anything online? I have found help with my specific problems before by swapping around search terms like that and online groups can be awesome because it doesn’t require face-to-face. 

You could also call your county health department and tell them you are experiencing trauma from an accident, can’t afford therapy, and see if they have any recommendations. 

I’m so sorry you went through that - it sounds awful. I was in an injury accident and it is incredibly traumatic, I totally understand. Just know that what you are feeling is common with accident victims and it’s like your brain is saying, “let’s just be scared of EVERYTHING for a while so that doesn’t happen again.” 

You will get better and you are not going crazy.  It will take some time.  Hang in there. Hugs "
"I hope this isnt misinterpreted but If you TRULY dont care about your life, rob a bank or get on a plane to a foreign place and start a new life or tell every stranger you see that you are alone and need help. Try everything, not just comfortable things. 

If your life is worthless then your pride shouldn't be a problem. There are millions of different lifestyles that you have never tried to live. 

I'm not ignoring or making fun of your pain, but if you really want to get better, maybe the type of life you are living isn't for you. 

Jobs and Bills and civilization isnt for everyone. I'm telling you this because it's what helped me get over my suicidal behavior and nihilism (I've played  roulette twice and used to cut myself for years) and I have no support system either. It's just me, but you can never be alone when you are stuck on a planet with 7 billion people. It's impossible to think your pain is unique. other can relate. I can relate, so that's proof right there.

No one wants death. We all want peace, but peace isn't the same for everyone. Dont let your pride and stubbornness push you to end it when you've only tried 1/1000000000000 possible options.

Life is painful, rich or poor, young or old,  we are all struggling because none of us have instructions. Some of us hide behind drugs or work or entertainment, others live recklessly through crime, sex and extreme activities. 

If you got in your car to go to work and it didnt start, you wouldnt quit your job, you would call in sick, catch a uber or bus, ask for a ride, ride a bike or walk. 

Dont give up on yourself because you lost a few rounds of a fight. It's not over until you decide to quit. And you only decide to quit because of pride. Dont die over pride."
"And that makes total sense. Especially for something as severe as that, I couldn’t even begin to imagine how awful that must be. 

I hope (and truly believe) things will get better for you as time goes on! ��"
"I agree with you but violent perpetrators don't usually attempt to guilt others. They tend to threaten or make grandiose claims or just snap and do it, rarely do they allow themselves or give reason to be stopped. "
"I feel you. 30 bucks for a regular doctor in plan and like 90 for a specialist a visit. And when you see a specialist for the first time and get put on a med, they are going to want to see you multiple times again "
"I have anxiety as well —- have you ever tried guided meditation? I know it doesn’t work with everyone, but it’s worth a shot. I’ve had the best sleep I have ever gotten after I started doing it before bed. "
"I have, No results or ideas why.

she keeps asking me why etc, and I'm always like ""well this is what I'm here for you're supposed to tell me and figure out!"" but I never tell her that cause I don't wanna upset her"
I think we’re gonna need more than that to determine if he’s a sociopath. Maybe your friend just doesn’t care about what happens in your life because of it’s mundane nature or he does but doesn’t show it.
"It makes you less terrified of the initial falling asleep so you aren’t apprehensive going into sleep and thus entering a dream in a nervous state. Then if you do have a nightmare, the waking up is less panicked."
"It's called a paranoid delusion and symptomatic of schizo type illnesses. 

Worked psych for four years and you'd be surprised how many people have this thought. Other one is they're constantly being surveillanced."
"I’m probably going to go see a secular one this winter. Still don’t know how its going to help, I’v tried adopting many other forms of philosophy like hedonism or absurdism and it just doesn’t work for me. "
Maybe you just lack understanding. Maybe you are wrong ? I could be . Lol that's your problem if you can't admit you are wrong or dont know you are fucked lol you will always be stupid because you will never learn
"My brain is in constant overthinking mode, I think it would be amazing if mindfulness worked for me. Unfortunately it doesn’t, maybe I’ve not tried enough techniques but overall I don’t really find it useful "
"No, you are insulting me.  I'm insulting you.  You are not me.  If you're having trouble distinguishing that, you're far worse off than I thought you were and I hope you get help before you physically hurt someone."
"Not sure if she's tenured, but honestly my plan is to just bite my tongue during lecture. If how she explains things is going to be on the exams that she makes up, I don't really have a choice but to listen to her "
"Personally I don't think retaliation is the solution here. It might work but I would expect him to see through it and disregard it. Could be wrong, but this doesn't seem like a fight-fire-with-fire situation to me."
"Personally what makes me wake up every day is that even though i struggle to care about myself, i know that there are a lot of people that feel the same pain that i do, and if i don't try to help them, noone will. "
"Please don't hurt yourself! If you feel you are getting to that point, please go to the ER immediately. :( I am so sorry your girl left you. That must hurt like a mofo...but please hang on. I am thinking about you."
"Thank you for sharing, very powerful words, they immediately hit me because it suddenly made me remember why I never stopped last time I was fighting, because of my family and how much they wanted me to be better. "
"Then your strategy is this: K.I.S.S. (""Keep It Simple Stupid"")! Just start with the thing you can do now. Something that only takes 5 minutes. Once you get into a habit of doing that, add something else, and so on."
"Well going to the hospital is going to be pretty expensive. And I can tell you that from my own personal experience. I'm truly sorry that you have to go through this. Life can be such a cruel, cruel thing at times."
Yeah my father suffers from few mental health problems which makes me feel that I may inherit them. I have been seeing eye floaters since I was a child but what I see is not eye floaters I'm pretty sure about that.
"as i suggested, she should talk to the person in question. even if you think someone else needs help, you still can’t force someone to get help, so as i originally said she should talk to the person in question. "
"Can relate. Been out for more than a month and I'm deathly afraid of going back to work. I used to work full time (exempt, which often means more than 40 hours per week). On top of the full-time status, it's a high pressure job. I need money, but am afraid I'll end up having to go off of work again. 

One thing I did think about doing was temp work. It's the only way I might be able to stay in the same line of work without working insane hours

Best of luck to you. "
"Hang in there lovely lady. Life can be very overwhelming, especially when you get close to a big life event, such as graduating college. As for the BPD, the key characteristic is typically a pattern of broken relationships. It sounds like things are hard with your parents, and yet it seems the issue is with your gender rather than a pattern of manipulative behavior. You mentioned friends, friends that clearly care about you, so let that be a reminder of your worth. "
He has some form of anxiety I can tell. He had to drop out of college because he was getting so overly nervous on the mornings he wouldn't be able to get himself to go in. Being in a classroom full of people was something that made him very uncomfortable. He would get on the bus to go and get to the college and just not have the guts up  to go in. It wasnt an excuse either ive seen him physically shaking on the mornings and so I could tell it was very hard for him.
"Hers comes from trauma as well.  Many different events from family members growing up,  ie grandma locking her in a closet, pushing her down stairs etc.  The primary trauma was a rape in HS by two classmates who then told everyone it was her idea, the event was her first time even being kissed by a boy, along with everything else. 

When she is in therapy it really really helps, unfortunately she struggles to maintain the progress and goes right back to old habits

"
"I can go to a doctor but the person that would process the paperwork is good friends with my parents and would most likely tell them and as I stated in my post my parents think that mental health problems are made up, the only other person that I can really talk to about it is my girlfriend but I cant talk to her about it without giving her an anxiety attack and I just feel like I am decreasing the quality of life for all the people around me and I just feel trapped"
"I don't *want* to commit suicide. I'm just doing it to kill this boredom man. I've been surrounded by it too but it hasn't made me into a sad or anxious person; maybe just desensitized. I'll see how I feel in two weeks. If I continue feeling the way I've been for the past six weeks there is not a doubt in my mind I'm doing it. But who knows? That may change. It changed to get to this point, it can change back to me being less bored doing the same meaningless things."
"Seems like these things would have extremely adverse effects. It is unfortunate you had to witness and go through all of this growing up, and have to deal with the effects of things that are not your fault. I cannot imagine how traumatic it must be. I hope things get better for you. Please do seek help as soon as you possibly can, and if you can do reach out to your local welfare/child protection services. They might be able to help. I hope all gets better for you. "
"Start by seeing your doctor. They should be able to point you in the right direction. 

Also, sorry you’re having to deal with this. I dealt with an addicted dad when I was in high school and I know how devastating it can be. As someone who has been in your shoes, focus on yourself and the positive relationships in your life. Then maybe once you’re feeling a bit better and stronger, then you can reevaluate how close of a relationship you’d like with your dad. "
"Then you need to go see a doctor. You need to put your mental health first. Otherwise things will never get better. The only other thing I can suggest is finding somebody to talk to that'll be understanding but also firm too. You need to find a way to get these thoughts out of your head. My feelings didn't start coming back until I started opening up to other people. Even if that's just a loved one. Whatever you do, you need to take care of this as soon as possible."
"Therapists do talk to each other about their clients.  It seems to me that if they don’t reveal the identity of the client, they can also share stories more publicly.  I’ve read some books where therapists talk about their clients and I think it’s really inappropriate. That makes me so uncomfortable, but I don’t think that there is anything I can do about that. I made it clear to my therapist that I don’t want him to share my story and I trust him not to. "
"This, seriously.

They should at least have a counselor you can talk to, someone who helps you find an IRL therapist when BH can't help you. Best case scenario is they provide you a therapy plan centered around reducing your anxiety enough to seek out someone offline.

You don't just turn away patients in this situation. I get that it's a liability thing, but still.

Edit: I see below that they did give OP some resources to find someone offline. That's a good start."
"You should see a professional for a diagnosis, this sounds like some form of depression. If it is depression and medication is not working, you should look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is a meant to rewire your brain into thinking more positively. My dad and brother went through this and it helped immensely and I am just starting it tomorrow.

I hope you feel better and I wish you luck! If you want to talk at any time just message me.

"I would say hallucinations are definitely a medical concern and it sucks your doctor writes them off. From an organic standpoint, there may be something (tumor) in your brain that would cause them. Substance use or abuse can cause them. If they happen when you go to sleep or wake up, they could be hypogogic/hyptopompic hallucinations. Psychologically, it could many things. Anxiety can cause hyperarousal that can make you see something in the corner of your eye (it could be a flash of light from the outside, first example). It could be something else. I would say your best bet would be to see a psychiatrist, as this is their speciality and can ask questions, send you for tests, and prescribe medication, if necessary. "
"It depends. If your illness is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, it is likely that it can only be managed (although if managed well, it can have a good prognosis very similar to a ""cure."") Some mental illnesses are caused by a negative environment and/or maladaptive learned behaviors. Those can absolutely be ""cured."" 

How can you tell the difference? It's very difficult and the two can sometimes be indistinguishable (especially if your disorder is caused by both.) Generally, therapy is the best way to find out. The proof is often in the pudding, so to speak. Still, there is some debate between the different schools of psychology over this topic. This is definitely not a question with a cut and dry answer."
"I'm going though anxiety and depression and I'm winning currently. The good days turn into good weeks and good months and you build on it 1 day at a time but first, you need to get professional help. Depending on where you live, here in the UK I can get free mental healthcare, I was able to see a counsellor and still do for 10+ hours, 1 hour slots, where we talk and she will gain an insight into my brain and how I work and what makes me tick and what I don't like and tell me things I don't know about myself that nobody else could tell me.

I beg you to go see a counsellor or therapist, ignore everyone else for now do this on your own and get a professional to help you and explain what is happening in your mind, it's given me a new lease and purpose in my life, I'm able to go out and do things I couldn't before and say things to people I would never dream of saying it to.

"I don't think the worsening is connected to the initial trigger. Like, I have my mental health issues from that experience, but that doesn't mean that experience is constantly the point of reason and influence if that makes any sense? 

Think of it this way, in a timeline sense; 13-21 There was always at least something wrong. There was always a reason for me to be depressed or something to blame. With blame, comes comfort in a way, you know? 

And I guess I kept waiting for my big ***break***, you know the one I'm talking about. Not the break***down***, but that feeling of - maybe when my life isn't so fucked up I'll be okay? The silver lining, the time where there's nothing seriously effecting your life to give you reason to be down. A time where you're supposed to feel fully happy. But I'm still.. not.

I've just freshly graduated from university and I feel lost. I've had to move out of my lovely home with my bf in the city and back into my mothers house with - obviously, my mother. Who happens to be an alcoholic. While he's moved back in with his big lovely family who really care for him. The plan he says is we spend a year apart and save for the endgame - a new place together, just us. But I have no job, I live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, my mother isn't even here half the time and I'm always so alone. I'm supposed to live an entire year like this?

And I get that too. I feel like I could be living the happiest life and I would still feel like that sometimes."
"Lol Srsly started tearing up. Thank you and a lot of this I know. That’s he kicker. I know he loves me and is doing his best. I know I’ll make it threw all this. I was more then sure the birth control was playing a big part in all of this. 

But even with all the things I KNOW it’s like... I don’t know why I still feel the way I do. Idk know why I’m getting jealous of stupid shit that means nothing. Idk why I think he would lie to me when he never has before (even if it was something he knew I wouldn’t like he would tell me) we are fairly open ppl (with each other) 

What kills me is not know WHY I still feel this way. That I feel the pain in my chest when I see or hear him msging a good friend of ours (a girl) like it’s fucking random convos they’ve always had. Yet I start to get that pressure in my chest my breathing gets heavy and it just idk how to explain it, it hurts. And the more I think about it the more I obsess then the more I get paranoid then the more scared I get like it’s this hellish pointless cycle cause I KNOW the truth and it’s like my heart is screaming at my brain to Srsly think about it but my brain just fucking dove in head first spiraling and jumping to one absurd thing after another that is unnecessary 

Thank you for your comment tho. I tried to explain this to him and a friend but I didn’t quite know how and how to word it. Still don’t know if I worded it all right. It just seems ridiculous how much this has been affecting me. 

And about the BC, I’m srsly thinking at this point of just riding it out. My doctor put me on it to fix my hormone lvls so even if I came off it they would just put me on a different hormone. And I don’t need to start this all over again heh.."
"From the author,

I am the oldest of three children. I have a younger sister and brother. My father was a city bus driver.  My mom was a stay at home caregiver.  I am from a small village in St. Louis, Missouri. I was raised in the Lutheran church.  I graduated high school in 1982.  I was a mediocre student. I only got A’s in band and English.  

At the age of 11 I experienced my first real trauma.  On a summer or weekend morning I was walking with a friend to a mutual acquaintance home for a game of whiffle ball.  Upon arrival we discovered our mutual friends brother sitting on a swing with a solemn expression on his face. We asked him where his brother was located.  He told us in a matter of fact manner that his brother was dead in the basement.  We were not sure if this was a joke or not and were determined to see for ourselves.  We entered the home, descended the stairs into the basement and discovered our friend hanging from a metal support beam with a belt around his neck.  My friend stayed on the basement steps.  I went up and poked the body.  He was certainly dead.   My friend was sobbing on the steps. I went up the stairs to the kitchen, picked up the phone and dialed 0 for the operator ( 911 did not yet exist) .  I had to step outside to get the address for the operator.  She told me help was on the way and that I should stand on the front stoop so the police could see where to stop.  I was scared, confused and shaken.  Why would someone so young (he was 15) take their own life?  

I will be sharing a little more about this experience in upcoming posts.  I believe this particular incident (and a few others) has lead to a couple of my obsessive thoughts... 1. I have an intrusive thought about being in the wrong place.  Example:  I used to arrive an hour early at work . I would count the wall tiles in the restroom to reassure myself I was in the right place. My fear was that if I was in the wrong place I would be arrested and fired. 2. I check my car for dead bodies.. I feared I may have hurt someone.  These thoughts seem silly...but they are persistent and if I don’t perform the compulsive behaviors that accompany them I become exceedingly agitated, I panic, I shut down..sometimes for hours. 

More to follow.."
"He definitely needs help but most likely will not get it. I suggest you start thinking about leaving and maybe read ""why does he do that?"" by Lundy Bancroft because it will give you good insight into your situation."
He tries really hard to go to the therapy sessions and comes out saying he feels better but then other days he will just refuse to go and sort of gains a fear of going because they unearthed something from his past.
I have one and love it. The best part was the day my tiny cat tried the wiggle her way under for a snuggle and couldn't because it weighed too much. Gave me a good giggle that day and a good night sleep every time.
"I'm bipolar type II, it's a wildly misunderstood diagnosis among mental health professionals that gets miss diagnosed as depression all the time I cant really blame the average person for having skewed info about it"
"It's super hard to make that first decision to get help and pretty hard to go to the appointment, but each time you go the fear lessens. You deserve to feel better, please take the risk and get help however you can."
"Like you said a hormonal test is the first thing to do if not the a psychologist and finally a psychiatrist.

For it to be bipolar you need to be in mania from 4 to 7 days followed by 3 or more months of depression."
"Not a stupid question! Medications are to balance out any imbalance of chemicals, not to get rid of all emotions and/or feelings. If something sad happens, anti-depressants aren't going to keep you from feeling sad."
"Ok well that's the context i was talking about. But dont be so quick to discount the perils of this type of duel relationship, many different things can occur.  Best to have a convo with him about that, that's all. "
"Well, I don't think it is really damaging me, but sometimes I feel like I could lose my mind or something because of it, and that scares me. I'll be sure to see a professional if it doesn't get any better. Thank you"
"Yeah I find myself in denial alot because it makes you feel  I guess , not ""normal"" , but then again , what is normal ? We all have our demons we fight in our head , just some of us , it's more intense than others ."
"Yes. It’s a common question that doctors in the military asked me when I was on my way to a diagnoses. 
They ask if you’re slower than normal and if it takes you longer to respond.
Apparently it’s very common "
"i understand the material though especially short quizzes the teacher always calls on me i can recall the information greately pass every practixe exam do well on all hw can recite it in class etc but exams
im blank"
"Beautiful! You've gained enough awareness about the issue that now you are half out of the anger. However, the bad memories trigger the pain for you. I would say two things: 

1) read the book ""feeling good"" by David Burns. Do not take the exercises casually. They've saved me from suicide.

2) once you're able to identify the negative thoughts in your mind you can also post them at lifeisokevenwhen.com (if there's any thought specifically around ""my life is shitty"")."
"Hi there! If the depression is really screwing with uni, your relationships, etc, then telling somebody would probably help. There are lots of things you can do to treat depression and make living with it easier. That said, if you're doing okay and life is fine, don't put yourself under any pressure to tell, yano? 

Have you thought at all about why you don't want to tell a therapist or doctor? There can be lots of good reasons, sometimes talking about them can help."
"I do talk to my cats a lot, especially the one that is super codependent and gets stressed out if in stressed. I tell him everything is going to get better and things are going to be ok one day of we can just get through the part that sucks. 

The way that things work out through the twists and turns of life is pretty interesting. Like you said, it's unique to everyone and who knows what will happen next. Maybe the next random thing that comes up will be a good one. "
I get chronic migraines so when I am hospitalized in psych I just tell people it is because of my migraines. I also want to be a teacher and everyone around me says they think I would be a great one but I have doubts because of my mental health issues. I am going to try to go back in spring after 2 years off and I am changing my major from elementary to secondary. I have dropped out 6 times with a medical withdrawal from elementary major through 3 different schools.
"I’ve been at my job for a few years now, one of the few who has, so I’m relatively close to my bosses and they’ve always known what’s going on in terms of my mental health so they’ve been quite understanding, and my main co-workers are my best friends so they also know,
I’ve been told that I can’t apply for new jobs while I’m on the sick note because it counts as working, plus I don’t think I have any of the skills needed to work remotely/from home "
"OP, this is excellent advice and a good reflection on your current state. Have you ever done any mindfulness? Go on to YouTube and google ‘ACT mindfulness leaves on a steam’. ACT is just a type of therapy and I find the ACT mindfulness clips are the best ones. You can’t control what thoughts pop into your head but you can control what you choose to do with them. Anxiety sucks dude. Check out the stuff I mentioned on YouTube - don’t think about it, just do it "
"Here’s the best advice I know to give: Own it. 

It’s your mental health. If they say you look depressed tell them it’s because you suffer from clinical depression. If they seem confused explain what it is, how many people it affects, and how you’re being treated for it. You’d be amazed at how many folks don’t know and how differently they behave once the understand. 

There’s a stigma against us and it’s up to us to unapologetically educate the masses. 

This may seem hard given your social anxiety but just remember that you’re not talking about yourself per se, you’re merely stating facts about clinical depression. Hope this helps. Just know that you are not alone in this. I’m rooting for you! "
"As far as I know there is no simple general fix to that problem, and it would take a lot of talking through with a therapist to address all the specific components of this problem that you have.

It's entirely possible that this is just your adult personality, and you'll have to adjust your life accordingly. Trying to get yourself to feel might not be the goal, but to seek out events and experiences that force you to feel stronger positive emotion. Concerts you really like, hikes up mountains, festivals, traveling with friends or maybe yourself etc. I found that learning an instrument helped me with a similar problem.

I'm not suggesting it, but some people benefit from trying a low dose of a psychedelic with friends in nature. 

Exercise and meditation would be a good choice to both amplify positive emotion and break down your reflex of holding it back.

Maybe you can sometimes feel yourself holding back positive emotion, try and use your inner monologue to stop that."
"I would start with a therapist.

Finding a therapist can be tough too. You might not find one that you get along with well at first. Also, therapy is a collaborative sport. You can expect to get as much out of it as you put into it.

It kind of sounds like anxiety. Maybe social anxiety. Which is very real and hard and something that affects a lot of people. But it's also something that a lot of people have overcome.

For me, it helped so much naming my condition. I was having anxiety and once I figured out what it was and started trying to treat it, I felt so much better. It also helped me to learn about cognitive schema. These pathways that our brains have developed that, at one time helped us, but now might be of no use to us (anxiety). You can retrain these pathways through practice by noticing them, and then shifting your thoughts to something positive. It sounded a little ridiculous to me at first but it's real! Your thoughts are powerful.

I hope you feel better!"
"Yeah I am in similar condition apart of that family thingy I don't really miss them. What I learned from the jobs I've been in, time is the king. Time and struggle in the work especially in new environment put you in the pressure so hard that you will be forced to find the solution and you will get better with that over time how to survive 10 hours. Just remember that your feelings won't last forever. Your body and your psyche will adapt and not all but most vicious feelings will go away with weeks, months. I can't stress out enough that your are still doing first impression during couple first weeks. Try your best during first couple weeks to build impression that you are at least normal dude willing to work hard and that you appreciate this chance.

"i have the same issue due to my eczema, my skin tears open and leaves wounds despite how much i moisturise. i used to have about 40 odd wounds that i would pick at constantly, now it’s down to about 10, i still pick but fortunately they’ve healed to a point where i can only do minimal damage ���� took about a year to heal the majority of them. basically what i did was i used TCP on each wound, and hydrocolloid plasters (they are circular plasters that are very resilient) a nail file to smooth down the raised skin, and a special cream called dermovate i got from my dermatologist. also the medication I’m on stops them from getting infected but that’s not the main purpose of it so i don’t think you’d be able to get it. i’d suggest seeing a dermatologist, but you have to try your best to fight the addiction, i know it sounds silly but it is a genuine addiction and to me it’s pretty much self harm, i’m ashamed of my skin and i’d love to not pick but i can’t help it, the best i can do is take care of my skin as best as i can and distract myself and let them heal, i’m getting there slowly and i’ve come a long way, it takes time but as long as you take care of your skin it will heal over time.

"Your teacher might not want to push you, for fear of prying into something that you might decide isn't her business. Mental health can be a really sensitive subject, and I know I've been faced with the choice between waiting for someone to open up and pushing them. It's a difficult balance to strike.

I'd reach out to your teacher and explain what you're feeling. She might be waiting for you to do just that, and even if she isn't, she'll be able to listen to your concerns. She might be able to give you resources, even.

Having someone to talk to about your mental health is important. Getting a therapist is going to be important for the future, but for now just taking that first step of talking to your support network is excellent.

This might be helpful for you, as well:

Additionally, I don't know if you have an income, but many therapists offer a sliding scale of payment. It's possible to ask around and hash out a much lower payment with a therapist based on your income, even without insurance.

If you have a university in your area, there's a good chance that there are psychology students at a teaching clinic that need to get experience treating patients. They're a great, inexpensive resource. Though they aren't fully certified yet, they're fully invested in you, one of their first patients, and are scrutinized by their supervisors to make sure their theory is sound. "
"I share some thoughts/perspectives with you. However, as I've gotten older I've realized that we are victims of our own perceptions and those aren't always accurate. For one thing, you are caring way too much about what others are doing. You're also assuming you know the motivators of other peoples' actions, which is usually based on your own thoughts and emotions about said action and aren't necessarily applicable or accurate when applied to another person. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he's in your personal space, address it. You're not a mind reader and neither is he. I have a feeling you prefer to deal with things passive agressively and then get pissed if someone misses the message. If you want to have control, you have to learn how to play the game - even if you don't mean it and you are just being a manipulative psychopath in the making (I mean that semi-seriously - after all they say a lot of CEOs are psychopaths). 

&amp;#x200B;

A murderous rampage is not going to play out like a movie or a book, like some glorious release, and systematically eliminating people you've interacted with and deemed incompetent would likely quickly reveal a common factor of YOU, so your serial killing spree will be quite short lived. I'm not saying that as a challenge but to make you examine these thoughts realistically. 

&amp;#x200B;

Find someone who can help you control your thought patterns and emotions - yes, even internal emotions - if you can't work on it alone. You may indeed have a chemical imbalance influencing your thoughts. Regardless, though, I think you could benefit greatly from honest self reflection, which will help you gain control over the things you CAN control so you won't feel so angry about the things you CAN'T control. "
"&gt; How do other people deal with this type of person?

Not everybody is going to be that understanding or sympathetic.  Its just the way it is.  Either they change, you change or everybody goes their separate ways."
"&gt; This could easily backfire.  

It might work too.  ""Never argue with fools, drunks and children"". - my old Daddy.  In many situations, you tell people how you want to be treated.  You don't let them guess at it."
"AH been there. It took me a LONG time to be happy about these things, believe me. Can you look for one beautiful thing around you and allow yourself to be happy, even if for a brief moment? :) I hope you feel better!"
"Do not taper off without doctor approval/help. It will make you feel dizzy and horrible tho. I wasn’t on it for very long and I had the same symptoms.

Tapering off can be dangerous if not monitored by your doctor."
"He's just verbalizing what he's thinking. Your husband and every man on the planet think ""I'd fuck her"" probably at least a half-dozen times a day. Just straight up tell him you don't want to hear him talk like that."
Hes never physically hurt me. Hes mentioned wanting to kill a past girlfriend because she was sending him messages about getting back together after 4 years of ghosting him. I assumed he said it out of anger though.
I am sorry that sounds horrible but I promise you are not alone. I hope you are seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist as well. There are many that do telephone or Skype consults if it is too hard to leave the house.
"I will repost: It sounds like you're an empath like myself. We feel all the emotions around us and some, and sometimes it can be lovely, but then again, other times it can be overwhelming. You can talk to me anytime!"
"I'm not anxious about anything specific. Just a general feeling of anxiety. Also, i do keep telling myself that i don't have to be ""productive"" and it's okay to stop. But this time it isn't working (usually it does)."
"If you'd like some examples from people posting their stories of parental abuse, r/raisedbynarcissists has plenty of posts. Some examples are helicopter parenting, projection, gaslighting, and hypocritical standards."
If you're not feeling hopeful (about CBT or anything) it's normal. That's what it does. Makes you feel skeptical about everything. It's like your brain is polluting your thoughts. You have to break the cycle somehow.
"In addition to narcissism, look up OCPD. So sorry you live in such an abusive home with a controlling dictator. Sounds like a nightmare. Take care. I hope your future life away from him is infinitely better for you x"
I’m sorry. I am not a self harmer and unsure how to help. I would be glad to continue to talk with you if you’d like. It seems like you need more than just my help though. Are you on any meds? Seeing a therapist?
"Take it exactly as prescribed. You can ask your doctor if taking it at a different time of day or if a different dosage will improve your sleep.

"Thanks man, that’s really the kind of analysis I could make use of. It’s just the PTSD diagnosis could throw up some roadblocks wiv careers i may wanna get into in future so wanna get it boxed off. Thanks again g"

This is exactly how my experiences with psychosis have been aswell. Could also add that I remember a lot of what I was thinking and what happened afterwards. It’s like a very real nightmare that lasts several days.
"I don't have any of those except the anxiety, but I also have a ""rare"" diagnosis. I talked to a psychologist and she said I am 100% suffering from (get this...) pyromania. Of all things. -\_- I feel ya, but don't let it get you down. You are so much more than your dx, and if you can, say something good about yourself in the mirror. Let yourself know that you ARE a good person who has problems, but hell, who doesn't? You are so much more than that. :) Good luck to you!"
"I have an obsession with fire...but I don't know if that's the same as what you're talking about. I can't stop thinking about it, I start fires compulsively and often...and everywhere I go, I am reminded of fire somehow. I have to distract my thinking and redirect it a lot when I am out in public or I would literally look like a drooling idiot standing there, staring at nothing (envisioning and daydreaming about setting everything I see on fire). -\_- Hope that helps?"
"I'm going to tell you something that I've only told family members. I've been laying in bed and just staring at the wall for over 2 years now. I rarely talk to anybody and the only productive thing I do is exercising and yard work. Besides that, I just stay in my room and basically do nothing. Sometimes I browse reddit but that's it. You need to go see a doctor. Get the help you need while you still have the chance. There's always the possibility that it'll get worse."
"I'm not from the US, but I think the idea still works here. I don't think my insurance would cover this, but I could give it a try, yeah. Had no idea about the sliding scale payment option. 
PsychologyToday doesn't have my country available but I'll take a look at others and try to inform myself about prices and conditions and all that.
Thank you so much again for the lengthy response, I need all the info I can get, so really appreciate you taking that time to answer."
"I'm sorry to hear you feel that way. I feel that way sometimes too, for me I think it's depression. My dad died when I was 9 and I spend years in black and white. I came out of it but sometimes I drift back in. Sometimes it lasts days, sometimes week, rarely months. I just take it day but day. I tell myself this feelings won;t last forever. I make a list of things that make me happy and I try to remind myself of my happiest days. You'll be ok and you're very strong xx"
"Not that impatience is a good thing, but the level you're on seems like a lack of self confidence. Have you ever heard the phrase time is money? It means your time is as valuable as money, because with time you can make money, learn new things, increase your mental or physical well being... Anything. So if someone wastes your time, not only did they take the time but the potential it stood for. Even children should be shown respect, and you should expect no different."
"To tidy my living space, I literally take everything and dump it into a single pile. Afterwards, I will sort it into smaller piles like schoolwork, laundry, clean clothes etc. Then, get boxes to keep all the stuff in and label them or just arrange them back onto a cupboard. You may want to just do a room today and another tmr. 

You can get a trash bag ready to throw anything you don’t want/need too! Worse come to worse, there are professional Organizers apparently "

"Mental illness itself isn’t anyone’s “fault” just as much as someone’s asthma or peanut allergy aren’t those people’s fault. It’s just a glitch in brain or body that we have to choose to manage. Take out the inhaler or the epi pen instead of saying “god this sucks and it’s all my fault and there’s nothing I can do.” I know that that’s simplistic and it’s not that easy, but you do have the power.

It seems as though you are basing your supposed worthlessness on the fact that your mental illness is holding you back, or what you can and cannot do, but your worth goes beyond that. You are worthy just by being you. Blaming yourself isn’t productive. Does it make you feel better? Does it get you anywhere? My guess is no. Although maybe you can use those negative feelings to motivate you to seek the help you need to build a better life.

I notice in another comment you mention you feel this only applies to you, so I also want you to think about - what makes you so special, so different than the rest of us, that mental illness is not real for you, but it is for me? If it’s real it’s real, if it’s not it’s not. I don’t mean this to sound harsh I just want to give you some food for thought. "
"They've tried, and they can't. It's not psychosis so antipsychotics don't work. It's not being depressed so antidepressants don't work. It's a deeply inbuilt (from birth from what we can tell) part of the person's psyche so therapy doesn't work. It's like trying to do therapy to stop you being nice or stop you being someone who likes the colour blue. 

It's roughly possible to do those things, for a given value of possible. But it involves a lot of abuse. You abuse the person for being one way and reward the person for acting differently, until their brain starts punishing them for acting ""wrong"" and rewarding them for acting ""right"".

There's no other way to do it, and there's nothing else you can call it. It's abuse. And it rarely does anything, even for how brutal a method it is.

The treatment for gender dysphoria is adapting the body, not adapting the brain. We've established that the brain can't be adapted, but we can do a lot for the body that brings it to within what trans people need it to be for their personal comfort.

So your psychiatrist will not prescribe you anything as it would be pointless. They may however be willing to refer you to gender identity services who will chat to you about how you're feeling."
"I was horribly bullied from Middle School (6th Grade) all the way to 11th Grade. It got so bad that in the beginning of my Senior year, I had tried to commit suicide and got locked in a Psych hospital for about a month. They asked me if I wanted to go home or go to another hospital made for adolescents, and I couldn't go home. I stayed in the other hospital from October until a couple weeks before my 18th birthday in February. They had to release me because I was turning 18 and I would have to go to an adult hospital and they didn't think that was the best thing for me (oy vey). So I went home in Febrauary, finished the school year out (I was put in a different school that had a special classroom for disturbed children), didn't have enough credits to graduate, took another whole year of HS (in that special classroom), and graduated from my home school district with people I never went to school with at age 19. I had gone to a Catholic School from grades 9-11...so I hadn't been in my home school since 8th grade. -\_\_- I am still feeling the effects from the bullying, so I know exactly what you're talking about. That stuff sticks with you for a long time and I have anxiety and severe depression now because my mom didn't do enough to stop the harassment and bullying, and she never believed me when I said I was on the edge of suicide. I still cut, I was an alcoholic, and I have a host of other problems now because of my past. Hang in there. You can talk to me if you need to."
"Hi. Psych Therapy is really what YOU make of it. No one else can tell you anything that will make your sessions get any better. We can tell you all the positive experiences we've had and all that would do is give you hope for your next session, only to be met with further failed expectations if you don't feel you are getting any better. The truth is, therapy is not something that can fix your problems. It is simply a GPS or map to your desired mental health status. You want to be happy and see life worth living? OK, go to therapy and discuss the things that you want out of life to get you there. Now after you leave said therapy session, if you're not doing those things, or in the very least, attempting to do said things, you will perceive therapy as wasted time and render it useless. Kind of like having a GPS device with no battery. There's no point in having the device if you aren't in position, or worse, aren't willing to follow it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been to therapy many times, as I have been admitted to the ward 5 times. I personally found therapy useless because I knew upon leaving the session, i'd go right back to my life, which I didn't desire very much. The sessions DID feel like a course, and even though I saw some attempt from them to personalize each session, I always felt like I was part of an assembly line. Therapist constantly checking their watch or clock to ensure they didn't take to much time on me when they knew they had 5 other appointments after me....Here I am damn near suicidal and I am observing a person PAID to help me check their watch every 5 minutes...it's sad. Bottom line, Don't expect to much from therapy, just go, talk out your issues to another person who may be able to give some sound advice on how to cope with those issues....But don't expect them to FIX YOU. You must do that. They are only paid to assist in helping you find the way. You have to drive.

"I wonder if everyone feels like this.

And why we keep doing our daily mundane shit.

And why we don’t spend all our waking hours trying to change it instead of trying to work around it and pretend it’s not there."
I've only had one panic attack (induced by drugs) but I felt very anxious the next couple days. I was even afraid to be alone at night in my bed. Over time the anxiety lessened as I became more comfortable in my mind.
"I've wanted to do this for so long. I remember reading that it completely changes your days since you start off with ""you time"" to set the stage, rather than jumping head first into the stress of traffic, work, life.."
"IDK that is why it hurt me so badly. I wasn't bragging (ok not much) but I was excited about what I was doing, and I guess because it is kind of a ""deviant"" behavior, that she took it as bragging. I am still hurt. :'("

You don’t need to have a mental illness to see a therapist! I really encourage you to give them a call back and give therapy a chance. They don’t turn people away for not being sick enough or shouldn’t at least!
"You need to tell your doctor about this. 

Health, both mental and physical, is a team effort. If you are having symptoms that are uncomfortable, painful or worrisome, tell your doctor and work on finding a solution. "
"I deal with splitting a lot- it’s when you see things in extremes. Someone isn’t a bad person; they’re the scum of the earth. You aren’t doing good; you’re doing better than you have in your entire life.

"normie life is dull and making a bit more cash to buy more toys doesn't excite enough to work for it. this sounds like an average persons pseudodepression to me. laziness isn't a normal thing either. you're lazy because the options you have aren't doing it for you in terms of motivation. i mean, what if the way everyone lives their life isn't for you? what if it's not a chemical thing in your brain and you just don't care that much? it can be a personality difference.

"Start with going to your PCP. See if they can recommend anyone in the network they know and trust. If that doesn't pan out, get prepared to do a lot of research on your own. 

This is going to take a lot of time. Finding someone who you think you might be able to work with, who you trust to recommend medications and testing, is going to take you looking at all the possible practices that take your insurance, that have openings for new patients, and can see you at a time you are available. Be prepared to make lots of phone calls, to cross people you really want to see off the list because they aren't taking new patients. Be determined to find answers and get help, otherwise you are setting yourself up for more anxiety.  "
"Yes, they do. YouTube is full of idiots like that and it makes it extremely hard for people who do actually suffer from it. I don't see it as a badge of honor, and I actually take every single precaution to hide it as much as I can. It burns inside me (sorry--bad pun there, unintended) and it has to come out. It does. Eventually. The biggest thrill of my life was going up to the woods by my house finally and sitting there for 20 minutes burning the paper I'd taken with me. The ground/leaves/timber is all soaking wet (we've been getting rain here constantly over the past few weeks) so there was no fire danger. I felt so alive. I felt ... just so good. 

Thanks for talking with me. I feel a little less like a freak today."
"I wasn’t the biggest fan of my inpatient either. Having to strip down, bend over and cough like they show inmates do on tv was horrifying to me when I arrived (and I have medical problems so I spent 9+ hours at an ER just waiting for them to evaluate me to make sure they could properly house me, which only involved blood work and and EKG). I had a panic attack after my mom left the facility and the staff just stared at me so I went and cried in my room for hours (and I found out later they have a whole separate room for people to calm down when they’re having anxiety and they never told me about it). The food was absolutely dreadful (and they barely accommodated my actual medical diet I need to be on) and we only got to go outside for like 30-45 minutes a day, assuming it wasn’t raining. There’s been several times I should’ve gone inpatient since then but I had such a negative experience I’ve been afraid to go back. Sorry you had to go through a shit show too"
"I'd really like to focus a lot more on sleep, and I know it's hugely important, but it's hard to bring myself to make the change.  I work extra at night so I can spend more of the day with my kids, running errands, cleaning, etc.  I used to work til 3 AM and get up at 6-7.  Now I go to bed around midnight.

I suspected diabetes at one point, but never went to the doctor to confirm.  I'm realizing now that there are way too many things I *should* be seeing my doctor about, but I'm just not, largely because it takes such a huge chunk of time out of my day.

As for the weight gain - it's definitely affected by my sleeping habits, but also a complete and utter lack of regulation in my diet since 2013.  After I graduated from college I went downhill.  I plateaued around 290 lbs and finally took the initiative to lose weight when I saw the scale say 300 for the first time.

I must admit - I have never loved myself enough to take care of myself, and this is all very new for me."
"hey, have you talked to your friends about this? just how you feel like you're the pity friend? they might just completely have no idea that you're feeling this way and they're really just messing around with you thinking you're in on it. I was picked on a lot by a certain group of friends, and at some point I got a little upset and told them how I felt (not gonna lie, I lashed out a bit), and at first they were defensive and did the whole ""oh wow, I didn't know you were sensitive"" and whatnot, but I just answered right back with ""well, I guess I am sensitive, I don't like it, stop it"", and..... they stopped. and I feel a lot more comfortable saying how I feel if it ever happens again. and we're all just the same as we were before in closeness, minus the me feeling like shit and them picking on me. sometimes, maybe the best thing to do is talking about it....

and if you talk to them about it, and things don't improve.... maybe they're not as great of people as you might think they are... and better to find out now than later when you feel even shittier and more depressed about the situation, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

also, if you really want to kill yourself, I really would love for you to talk to someone. if you don't want to get professional help, maybe even just call a hotline? 1800273TALK. I have this number by memory because you never know when you'd benefit from it. rather it's for me or someone I come across.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. I really hope you find a good solution to this. let me know how it goes. I'd really like to hear back from you and hear what you end up doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep your head up. You're amazing just the way you are. Don't change yourself. Change your environment, if it must be."
Don't be scared to take your medication. Is it a guarantee that the pills will work for you? No. It's never a guarantee. But you'll never know until you start taking them. You need to do this if you want to get better.
"I am not. I have been unable to afford a psychiatrist for a while now. My insurance won’t cover anything, it’s all out of pocket to a deductible. I can’t change the insurance cause it’s the family insurance rn."
"I asked for the possibility that your robotism would be caused by blocking some painful emotions or memories. I'd guess these could surface as physical symptoms, like insomnia, flu, backpain, or anything at all really."
I don’t necessarily have any advice but that does sound like quite a lot. Maybe just recognizing that it is a lot and it’s perfectly okay to be stressed about would help? Hope all goes well with the new therapist!
I have Asperger's so I know what this feels like. I am horrible socially still at 47! I hate social situations and I don't like meeting people face to face. I hope you can find a way to feel better. :( Lots of huggggs!
I think I take a bath like 5 times a year now haha. I just have a quick shower nowadays so I don't have to sit with my thoughts. Baths for me must be bath bombs and a book to keep me company which makes it a nice treat
I'd write a letter to the labour board instead. Companies are legally required to make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. At least in Ontario depression is recognized as a protected disability.
"I've gone through a couple therapists before finding one I like. Feel free to ask them questions too, you want to feel comfortable. You don't have to ask anyone for their recommendations of it makes you uncomfortable. "
"If you're anything like me, your wellbutrin will make you into a better version of yourself over time.. I've been on Wellbutrin SR 150MG twice a day for the last 2 1/2 years and I feel it's changed me for the better.. "
"If you're doing this for school credit, especially in a graduate program, you have an obligation to make your own survey and not steal other people's work.  Doubly so since you have no idea how to interpret the survey."
It might be a healthy coping mechanism. Trying to control it might be damaging. Sorry to hear about your mother but I don't think it's helpful to equate one person's issue to your mother's based on one similar symptom.
Motivation is a tricky thing. Struggling with motivation could be an indicator of mental illness of some sort or just something non-pathologically well it’s hard to say. What else makes you think you’re not normal?
"Oh yes. I get super judgemental. I hate that part of myself. Once I start judging someone, it becomes an all-encompassing monster. I started getting judgemental of my best friend, ended up breaking off the friendship. "
SentimentalCorp isn't somewhere you want to be for a long time. I've given up weed/cigs/drinking for about a year now. And I understand what you mean to say. Feel free to pm me anytime if you want to discuss anything.
She really should see a psychiatrist. BPD is a possibility. Tell her to just keep trying; it can take a long time to get the right diagnosis and treatment. Keep seeking help and don't let their inaction discourage you.
"That is exactly how it feels for me. Just keep emptying out that dang spare room and make sure you throw away all that broken, unwanted stuff.   


Sounds like you and your Therapist are a good match. Good luck to you!"
Then you need to talk to the people who are still talking to you do it that way. You will never get over this still you have some closure from the whole thing which is why it's probably affecting you alot emotionally.
"Yah I love my job.

They have classes, a lot of them are like cycling and zoomba and stuff.

I wanted to get into boxing, but yah money and fatigue after work.

They have a couple yoga classes on the weekend at my gym."
"Yeah, I think it's one of the hardest things about it. You want to say things to try and rekindle, and they want there space. You need to communication so you can feel better, they need the lack of it too feel better. "
"You probably even believe half of that.

They all do.  Even when you start sabotaging her work, you'll probably still believe that you're doing her a favor.

Seen it before, seeing it and will see it again.

Buh-bye.

"
"You set out to change, don't look back as much as you can.  Focus now on being better at whatever brought you to therapy.  Now you are in the desert, alone with yourself...  struggle through it, continue therapy.  GL. "
"Hey, from my understanding, I have chemical depression, which means that I take those medications almost exactly (but at a lower dosage) because I feel sad even when everything is alright. So, don’t quote me on this, but those meds are not a miracle. They don’t really stop ya from being sad about something, just being sad for no reason. In my experience, the medication really starts to help and take effect after the event. Hang in there, and good luck to ya! �� "
"I heavily disagree with all that shit people say about suicide being ""selfish"" or ""lame"". If someone is definitively suffering through life, they should have the right to end it on their own terms. What are they supposed to do, live a horrible life they don't want to live, just so that their relatives don't feel sad when they kill themselves? That idea to me seems far more selfish, and it's definitely hypocritical to call the suicidal person selfish with that mentality."
"I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was 16. Sounds like you have a similar experience to what I did.
I didn't realise on my own, my English teacher contacted my mum and asked if she could get me tested.
I can't say anything on the ADHD but it sounds to me like you have dyslexia.
In terms of going to a professional, it sounds like you're still in school so I would push for a diagnosis. That way you will get the extra support that will make a huge difference to your work"
"It often takes many generations for someone to break into the next class level.  My parents were similar to yours.  They didn't say they wouldn't support me but in no uncertain terms, they told me to make sure my aspirations were reasonable; whatever that meant.

I worked two jobs to get my daughter into the best school that I could afford.  I didn't want her to suffer through the working class mindset that is generational in my family.  It was tough but so far so good."
"Not that long if I remember correctly. The last time I got out of the hospital, I had my appointments set up the following week after getting out. He'll likely evaluate your condition on your first appointment and make a decision then.

Edit: The process might be different for you. I didn't have a super long intake like you might have. I had separate appointments set up after getting out with a case manager, counselor and a psychiatrist. Sorry if that doesn't help much."
"Oh god, you guys. I don't even know how to respond to everyone's kind comments. Thank you, thank you all so much for your thoughts and love. It means so much to and it really helped. And thank you for those of you who offered to be a listening ear to me, that's so kind of you. 

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now and can't properly put my thoughts into words but I wanted to thank you all firstly. I will type in an update soon, when my mind allows me to do so. &lt;3"
"Same here. I have no problems making friends, in fact I have lots of them, which helps me tremendously, but I went through 7 years alone after my last break up.  I've been in a relationship now for 1.5 years, which I'm ruining because of that fear again - we're very happy, but I'm jealous and controlling and he cannot deal with my anxiety. We live together and now he'll move out to see if things get better, but all that I can think of is that's just a slow breaking up. "
"Science supports high intensity training and a good diet for mental health.

Science supports going out and talking to people as well as that close knit friendship.

Supplements have some evidence. Vitamin C+Zinc for men can boost mood in men and Vitamin C is a cathacolemine cofactor.

Good sleep is absolutely essential

Good sex and a romantic relationship and if not in a romantic relationship flirting and interacting with women is good for a mans health.

"See the comment I just posted recently regarding depersonalization/derealization.

“I experience similar phenomena. It’s almost as if I am never really “present” in those moments and I kind of snap back into reality after the fact. It kind of feels like some sort of autopilot and when it’s all over I feel distant from who I was in that moment. It’s almost like I have different “modes” depending on the situation (who I am with, my environment, etc.).”

"
Your daughter is mentally ill you can’t blame or fault or for that because it’s not her fault. She needs to be in counseling all the time. If your suspect she’s going to kill herself then you need to take action before it’s too late. Also eating disorders are nothing to scoff on they are also a serious mental illness. You have to understand that just because something gets hard doesn’t mean you give up you have to keep fighting this is your kid I’m sorry raising her isn’t as easy as you anticipated but that’s not her fault you chose to have her. Also calling your daughter a bitch is a little extreme. Get her meds right get her a diagnosis you have to fight for because she may not want to fight for herself
"“You can’t control me” is what he says? Right. Well he can’t use that to get out of being a dick. All you’ve done is ask him to have a bit of respect and not say irrelevant/insensitive things, that’s not being controlling. He sounds mega defensive, I’ve heard the ‘you can’t control me’ ‘you can’t tell me what to do’ etc lines before and tbh it’s usually used when someone is being prat and they know full well, they don’t like themselves and god forbid anyone point out their flaws because then they’ll have to grow up and examine themselves, which they’re far too insecure to do. 
Edit: I’d calmly say to him that you want to be able to express yourself and for him to listen and consider your feelings more in future. Then ask why he thinks you’re ‘controlling him’. If someone is not hearing you then turning it back at them with a question (I.e why do you think I’m controlling you) will at least give you some clarity via their answer "
"I’ve experienced a very similar situation to you, also from the north, 20. I moved away from home to be in uni 2 years ago where I just instantly sank back into anxiety and depression. I also felt lost, like I wasn’t supposed to be there and I didn’t feel as though I could fit in with any group or speak to anyone on any level. 

For me, the reason I hated every second of my life in uni was because I felt stuck and forced into the wrong degree- it took 2 failed attempts at first year to realise, along with my girlfriends words of wisdom. I’ve now taken a gap year to consider all of my options going forward and for me it’s been the best decision, straight away I feel 100x better for it, I’d say to trust your gut- if it’s telling you it’s the wrong time, then it’s the wrong time to be in uni!

I just think we were made to believe by our colleges that we HAVE to go to uni and the sooner the better. Well the truth is that there is no rush, people can go to uni at any age, there’s plenty of other ways to succeed or make some money whilst you wait for the right time. 

You should totally utilise the counselling offered by your uni, they’re very helpful. When you go in I recommend preparing all the issues you’d like to discuss in advance and make the most of the time. If I may ask, do you feel happy with your course choice? 



PS. You are meant to be happy, everyone deserves to be happy and live a great life. You’re just going through an especially tough time, with the transition of moving away from home for the first time! We all have times like this &amp; together we can all pull through, I really wish you the best and I hope that this helps in any small way. Feel free to message me back if you want to!

"Well, the first step is to make appointments. I know it's hard and you feel like you have to force yourself to do it but if you don't, you'll just get worse. Make the first step today and call your primary care and make the appointment. I know you probably won't believe this right now but you're only 19 so you have your entire life ahead of you and you have plenty of time to get help and still have a great life.

As far as the gym and exercise, I know it sucks but you need to push yourself to exercise **EVERY** day. Exercise naturally releases serotonin and other happy chemicals so it will improve your depression and anxiety. I started exercising over a year ago and make sure to exercise for at least 30-45 minutes every morning and it has helped me a ton. I started out just walking around my block every morning and gradually added more exercises in. I had to force myself to do it for the first few weeks but now it's part of my daily routine and when I don't exercise, my depression and anxiety do get worse.

Do you have a pet or have you ever had a pet? Getting a dog or cat may be helpful for you as it will give you a reason to get out of bed and think about something else besides being stuck in your own head. A dog is good because then it forces you to go for walks and exercise every day. Even if you can't get a dog or cat, there are smaller animals that you could get that would still be better than nothing. Is that an option for you?

Do you have a PC that you can game on? Gaming has actually helped improve my depression and anxiety a bunch. If you have a PC you can game on, we could play together and support each other.

What's your major in college? What kind of career would interest you?

&gt; I'm not even sure I'll be alive by the time I'm out of college, started feeling terrible in the spring and it just gets fucking worse and it is my fault

That's your depression talking, not you. You have to fight and not let your depression win. It wants you dead and you have to fight it. You can fight it by taking the small steps that I've already mentioned and start by making an appointment with your primary care. I promise you, if you fight your depression, your life **WILL** get better, but the only person who can fight it is you. I've lost a friend to suicide and it made me realize that no matter how much I hurt, I would never purposely harm myself.

Does your family know you're struggling? Do you live with your parents? You should really consider talking to them about this and letting them know you would appreciate their support. I know how hard and uncomfortable it can be to talk about mental health issues to family but your family loves you and wants you to be happy. You might be surprised how supportive your loved ones can be."
Betterhelp is about $200/month and you can only get 2 appointments a month on average. Most of the therapists either flake on the appointment or are booked up for the next 2 weeks. I didn't think it was worth the money.
"I agree with darkstar. You may feel better ignoring any flaws, but you have them and need to address them in order to get better. Otherwise your therapy is pointless and really all you are looking for is a cheerleader. "
"I see where you are coming from and completely agree, so the only platform I use is Instagram, and that’s mainly for memes lol
I just occasionally come across those triggering pages that make me wanna rip my hair out "
"If you reset do you not get to see all those people again? 

I would like a new brain. I'm forgetful, I'm stupid and can't hold a conversation or make people laugh. I'd like to go back and learn how to do these things. "
"I’m not trying to scare you or anything! Like I said, I’m not an expert but maybe seeing a psychologist would help. Changes in mood are normal but if they’re quite extreme then you should probably talk to someone."
"Just wanted to say how lucky your wife is to have a husband as thoughtful and as caring as you! I’ve known people bail in the same situation, or expected too much of the other person.

Wishing her a speedy recovery :)"
"Right now, no.  She's asked that we go before, it this point we are seperated and living together for the sake of the kids, both working through individual therapy at the moment, the seperation is less than a month old."
"Sending lots of love your way. I was always a misfit myself, and I never had any friends. Even worse, I was bullied to the point of suicide. I feel ya. I hope you can find someone in real life that you CAN connect with!"
"Thank you replying and sharing, your well wishes do mean alot to me because of how scared I've been of even admitting to myself I have a problem. There are people in my life I am scared to lose so I'll keep swimming. :)"
"That’s interesting, I really thought I was crazy for feeling this way. Typically I’m not afraid of other people I’m afraid of getting super disconnected and no matter where I drive I’ll never get closer to home "
Why would you choose to give up the one thing that makes you special? I mean now you don't have to do normal society things. You get to just be your own messed up self without having to put in effort. Makes sense to me.
"Yes, that was my point too...I am not trying to dx either, but I thought there were some terms that may or may not fit. The only way to know for sure is to get an eval done by a professional. :) I wish you good luck OP."
You are so welcome. And thank you. It took me too many years to realize that I needed help and needed to set boundaries with those around me. If you ever have anything else you want to ask about feel free to message me.
"&gt;you would do that **but**

This ""but"" is your primary concern right now, as you can't get better without therapy, and to engage in it you need to fix the finances, so we go for them. Two options:

- If you are functional, engage in work


- You aren't functional enough for job?
 Develop your own coping techniques to just get through the job and acquire enough balance for the therapy

&gt;would

Great, going to therapy isn't a problem by itself, finances are primary

"Depression is different for different people. Some people are more tearful and others can experience their depression in terms of irritability. You don't have to hit every single symptom to have depression (or another mood disorder.) A therapist is really your best option for figuring out what's going on. Don't worry-- if you don't have a mood disorder and you do go see a therapist, you won't suddenly catch it from going. Mental illness isn't a communicable disease, lol."
"I don't know if I replied on your other post, but I get the same way with fire. I actually can see myself lighting something up. For example, I was walking and I saw curtains hanging out the window of an apartment. It was such a vivid image that I could almost see the flames and smell the smoke. Thank goodness I was able to squash that impulse. I had a lighter on me, so I had to grit my teeth and think of something else quickly. I totally understand. Sending love to you!"
It common to feel annoyed at the world around you. Especially if you are around them a lot. Guilt is also a common feeling. Don't banish the thoughts or feelings as being unacceptable instead acknowledge the thoughts as they come. There is no good or bad emotion its the management of the emotion that is key.Once you can acknowledge the thought or emtion for what it is let it pass to the next thought. Mindfulness. Also remember forgiveness is for you not the other person.
"It may or may not point to mental health issues. Could point to loneliness or low self-esteem. Or maybe you developed an insecure attachment style in your earliest relationships and now you easily latch onto people (to an unhealthy extent). Might just be out of habit at this point. Or all of these could be wrong and it’s something else. 

There’s a lot of possibilities of what’s causing it. The question I have is, do you want it to stop or keep on living this way? "
"Maybe you could ring a mental health helpline and speak to someone. It might be easier for you to explain your problems to a stranger and also not face to face., this sometimes makes it easier. They should still be trained professionals who can point you in the right direction. You have been brave enough to come on here and tell us how you’re really feeling so I think that would be a good next step for you. Hope you get the help you need and start feeling better soon x"
"Thanks to everyone who commented for the advice. Just wanted to follow this up with saying how much I despise America’s health care system. I took her to the ER today, waited 5 hours to see a social worker who decided she needs inpatient just to wait another 5 hours to file mountains of paperwork and all the while she can’t even tell what’s real and what’s not. This isn’t to say the individuals weren’t helpful but this system is absolute trash and disgusts me"
"This isn't really in response to you question, but if seeing a psychiatrist for that long isn't making a difference I would say it's probably worth putting that money to your future should you decide that you want one. If it were me I would probably give that a shot. It may be that by  moving forward and investing in it, life becomes something you want. If not, at least you've covered you basis. You could make the decision knowing with more certainty it's what you want. "
"True. I just feel like people don’t really get angry when friends and family give shorty advice about how to deal with their broken ankle or spout some old wives tale about feeding colds and burning a fever, they usually give them a pass because they’re not a doctor and don’t actually know any better but somehow people are expected to know how to deal with the mentally ill? 

Like if you can’t be empathetic and try to help that’s not ok but that’s different. "
"You sound like you might be depressed and socially anxious, if you can see a counselor/psychiatrist they might be able to give you the answers and give you a path to follow. I suffer from POCD (Pedophile OCD) and there was a horrible period of time when I legitimately thought I was a pedophile and a monster before I was diagnosed. Very few, if any, people on reddit could properly diagnose you. Try to see if you can get professional help. 
I wish you luck and good health!"
"I have the same issues, but I've also been diagnosed with ADD, so that could be part of it. The best thing for me is to write everything down. For school stuff and personal stuff, I have a paper calendar, and if it's not on there, it isn't going to happen. For work, when people ask me to do something, I ask them to email me or I write down everything they say. When the email comes, you can turn it into an appointment on your calendar. I also make to do lists and have checklists for processes with multiple steps. I have post-its everywhere. People just think that's the way I am. I've been a legal assistant for 17 years and no one has thought badly of me. They just think I like lists and have a lot going on, which is true. "
"I'm not sure. We only think that this might be his first love because if he did have other partners in the past, he could have also been as secretive as he is now. It's understandable, and I do get why he might want to be more independent but it is kinda worrying how he has made a switch so suddenly from seeing us all the time to acting like he barely knows us at all. Spending all of his time in his room alone, and only maintaining a surface level relationship with the people he knows. It's such a massive change in his personality from the guy that would stay up late playing video games with us and dragging us around town to avoiding us entirely. Perhaps maybe he's just grown up really quickly in the span of a few months?"
"I've always had a ton of anxiety and refused medication for most of my life (despite being a therapist and often recommending to others that they see a psychiatrist for meds).  For many years I was apprehensive.  About 8 months ago I decided to finally talk to a psychiatrist myself.  It was determined that most of my anxiety and stress is stemming from undiagnosed ADHD and I started on Adderall.  

I feel very different when I'm on it.  I can focus and it almost takes all of my normal anxiety away.  I'm so glad I made the decision and wish I had done so in my 20's rather than my 30's.  


I don't feel like it's made me a different person, rather, I feel like it's something that has finally allowed me to be my best self.  "
"This is actually quite helpful. I went through a lot of sexual childhood trauma for about three years. I have went through CBT as a teen. But as an adult nothing like that has been brought up. I had to look up DBT therapy and am thinking about mentioning it to my psychologist. I live in a very rural area, so I take what I can get when it comes to mental health care. I’m so scared to let any of my doctors know how I’m currently feeling though. I was hospitalized at the state hospital for a very long time, and I can’t go through that again. My experience at Broughton was not a very pleasant one. It was scary, and they just seemed to pump everyone full of Thorazine and numerous other meds to keep people from acting up."
"Depends on how you're obsessing. As a general rule think about what you're obsessing about and ask yourself have I've done something about this? If the answer is no than do something about it. If the answer is yes ask yourself can I do more in an effective way? If the answer is no than realize some things are out of your control and try to break the cycle, move on to a different problem. More often than not this will relax your mind and could help you find a solution. If the answer is yes do something about it but try to ask yourself is this an efficient use of my energy and time. Again if the answer is no realize that some things are out of your control and move on to the next problem. Do this as many times as you can. Eventually if you can do something do it if you can't do anymore or anything at all it is a problem beyond your control there are other things you can work on instead. Retrain your brain, forming a new thinking pattern takes about 90 days so stick with it. "
"&gt; Therapy is difficult because I, counter intuitively, feel a lot better being able share my mind and lose the ability to convey the seriousness of my low points. I sort of forget how bad it can be and wonder why I'm even there.

This is me. I go to therapy and 75% of the time, I suddenly don't have anything to report because I actually have the opportunity to be listened to and understood. As a result, I don't feel so horrible, and then I leave and feel awful within the hour, especially because I ""missed the opportunity"" to get help. That pushes me further into negativity because, in my head, I'm continuing to be a failure and waste time and money when I could be receiving treatment. I completely understand where your feelings in this aspect are coming from.

Fortunately, that isn't usually me anymore. I'm doing better on my own and don't attend therapy sessions. But you should know there are people with very similar experiences, and it might help you to take some brief notes on how you're feeling before attending therapy. That way, you can report how you were feeling when you were at your low points. Getting that discussion going is the most important factor in making your therapy more productive.

All the best to you."
"You're welcome. It's a real shame there's a lot of things that contribute to MA level clinicians taking on cases way above their training and pay grade but the only people that truly suffers is the patient. So I am always a big advocate that unless you need basic life coaching, if you need actual therapy you need someone with a PhD. Typically these people dont have big advertisements because they charge enough and tend to have a full case load because of their qualifications.

I'm glad you could find someone more qualified for your issues and get an appointment. It's hard to get the good ones for a lot of reasons so I wish you luck. 

Also there's so many factors that go into what would make someone a good therapy for you. Personal approach aside, what theoretical orientation and therapy approach they utilize is key. Plus their areas of interest and specialties. Even where they got their doctorates and did their training before going into practice can effect things a lot. 

So you have a lot to consider when seeing therapists and if one doesnt workout understand there's a lot of factors influencing why and remain open that maybe a different person with different training experiences and different approaches may do the job  "
"The report I was talking about was the the psychologist/psychiatrist report from when you were in the ER. But yeah, I can't *really* give you any answers about why that ER psych didn't send the ""actual assessment report"" from that separate organisation where it should have been sent (your psychiatrist). 

It does seem wrong that that original report was not sent to your psychiatrist. Maybe it was misplaced. Maybe it was accidentally shredded, or maybe the ER psych doc still has the report and wanted to keep it until they had their report done? Either way, I can empathise with what I think you're feeling. 

I maybe should have said that I live in Canada, so I'm not suuuuuper familiar with the way the US health care system works, but I think I have a basic understanding. My office uses a couple programs that give us access to any reports from certain hospitals in my province, and often times we can access the reports there much sooner than we received them via mail or fax. But despite that, the system does not show any reports until they're done. So maybe the ER doc's note is similar to that? (Still can't explain them not sending the original assessment report though). 

If you're able to contact Kaiser or that ER psych doc, do it. If they give you a hard time about giving you any information, ask your psychiatrist to try and get that information. 

I don't know if I'm making you more frustrated trying to blabber on, that is not my intention. I swear I'm trying to be helpful! "
"&gt; I just turned 28 now, so I've been doing these things for over half my life. You seem like you understand the spiritual aspect of it.

Just some context here. Was born to an orthodox muslim father and a devout Christian mother. I have been in out of the church and mosque growing up. I just turned 28 too albeit a man, I am going through battles of my own so I have a bit of perspective on this.

**Hebrews 11 : 1**: “Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we cannot see.”

You’ve probably read or heard that verse plenty times before but I will encourage you to read the entire **chapter 11**. 

See much like mental health, faith when put into practice is a virtue that can have tremendous impact on life and the people around us. I learnt that by just watching my mother as a kid wade through obstacles by the unwavering belief she has that things will always get better. You don’t have to be perfect, you just need to believe. And believing always, always comes with doubts. 


&gt; ""What if I had just prayed one more time about it and God might have worked."" I feel like often times he is only waiting on us. But I don't know how to stop. I feel like no matter what, from reading these comments I will seek help at the very least to try and learn tools to stop myself. 


Yes! Yes to this. Please get professional help. My mother’s response to me is what it is. It even hurt more because she’s a healthcare professional. But to pick up where I left, praying doesn’t mean you’ll get better right away. Or in a month or a year. Quite frankly, it doesn’t mean you’ll get better at all but that’s the point of believing, right?

Say you start seeing a counselor, therapist or psychiatrist. You start the process, things are slowly looking on the up. There will be days, weeks and God forbid, months when things just look like they’re not working. Those are the days when you lean further in on your faith. Yes, reach out to family, friends and even your therapist but having the inner fortitude outside of people will carry you. 


&gt; I would just feel better if my husband was on board, maybe he will be. You never know! Thanks for the kind words!


I’m not married so I wouldn’t know much about marriage but from what I hear, your partner will be absolutely out of his mind to not be on board with you trying to seek help to get better. If he loves you, if he’s a man who loves God, he will 100 percent be behind you. "
"When you buy a new computer, what is the one thing it usually does great? Run well? Speed is always at it's peak right? Fun times, no complaints....But what happens when you start downloading software and adding more and more data? It starts to slow down...sad. All the fun times you had on said computer seems forgotten and now all you can think about is replacing it because no matter what you do, it won't get back to the way it use to be. Uninstalling stuff does little. Deleting documents hardly makes you see a difference. Facts are...the performance is now subpar compared to what you remember it being at it's peak.

​

I say all that to say this. Your friend just wants the computer (YOU) back at peak performance. He remembers better days with you and it saddens him because he put time, effort, and his love into your relationship, just as much as you probably did. Now, things have changed for you and he is trying his best to help you delete the bad data (baggage) and make you run like normal. Problem is, he doesn't realize, it's impossible to do so. You are experiencing real life issues and it's 100% normal and ok to feel the way you do. What he doesn't see is that you can only change when YOU address the issues that are interfering with your mood. And him getting upset at you won't help that because i'm sure you're hurting more knowing he is hurting because of you. Tell him something along the lines of this, ""Hey, I realize i'm a little distant at the moment, and I don't know how long I will feel this way. I understand things have changed between us due to these current issues i'm trying to address. I'm sorry if I make you feel sad, or make you feel like it's something you did, but i'm being honest when I say it's not you. I just need some time to address the way i'm feeling, and you being mad at me constantly isn't helping. I wish things were the same too, but life isn't always a steady course. We all have down periods and it would speak volumes about our friendship if you could be supportive during this time for me.""

​

I genuinely think your friend doesn't know he is being annoying. He makes it about him cause to be honest...It is about him to...You were best friends and when you are experiencing something, even personal from within, it has an affect on those who were closest to you. Hope you feel better and understand, you're not alone.

"&gt; ehavioural disorders or learning disabilities? This is what I’d be like if I was never put on ADHD medication. Who knows, there might be a simple explanation!

Yeah. I have ADHD and non-verbal learning disability."
Also have obsession that people can tell that there is something wrong with me. Particularly troubling when I shop. I know people aren’t telepathic but the thought and the anxiety that accompanies it cannot be shaken.
"Here is the thing, I have a psych, I have meds. But now all of them are starting to fail because I cannot ebb my emotions anymore. Being schizoaffective, this is pretty bad, had to substitute to ebbing my mind with weed
"
"How long have you been taking it? 

I know they usually start people for the first week on a half dose but they didn't do that with me. Wondering if its because they side effects last for a week but that is just a guess."
"I am here to talk to if you need me. I would love to chat if you are up to it. :) Just think of a llama with a purple party hat on doing the jitterbug with a porcupine and hopefully you'll smile. :D

Thanks for the hugs!"
I don’t feel like I fit in this society. All I want to do is get away from it. The selfishness the greed the materialistic nature of people. And so on. I wish things could be easy for people who see through that stuff.
"I hate how true this is. I was diagnosed with ocd,ptsd, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, psychosis. People i tell this about only acknowledge depression and get mad or question me when it comes to the other problems."
"I have gotten some panic attacks in the past week or two.  Perhaps that is the reason why I am experiencing regular disorientation.  But, I have felt confused at times since the start of my mind racing.  So who knows... "
"I wish I could, but at the moment we are in a long-distance relationship. I think I might offer to call or text him after his appointment if he wants to talk about how it went.    
Thank you very much for your advice. :)"
"I'd like to be, and strive to be, 'functional in society'.. 

1)living on my own

2) holding a job that doesn't make me feel mentally insufficient

3) feeling stable 

but normal? no, I would be satisfied with functional"
"It means giving false hope. 
I’ve had a bad night. It’s 4:52am in the UK and I’m just going to bed. Couldn’t stop listening to good songs and looking at old photographs. Hopefully I can sleep. 
Thanks for asking."
"I’m not sure about public/private yet, I thought I’d find out if it was a plausible choice first.
Would you be able to tell me a bit about private hospital psych admissions?  I know next to nothing about all of this."
"Mainly the ones at the end, that talked about how people were treated in hospital. But the whole survey is blatantly framed as ""Here's a problem. Tell us how bad it is."" When it should be framed as ""is there a problem?"" "
"Make a to do list in the morning and check everything off once you get it done. 
Was having the same feeling a while ago but since I have a visual prove of how much I got done, I feel way better and proud in the evening."
"Perhaps meet him during office hours and ask how he's enjoying teaching the class? Maybe ask him if there was something he wished was easier and use that as a starting point to find some stable ground for you and him.  
"
"Sorry, your mother is mistaken. She may have been conditioned to believe that by her upbringing and/or environment, possibly by being in a similar situation herself as she was growing up.
Do not hate her, re-educate her."
"Thanks, I'd read about Prozac making some people more depressed but I thought that since I was on it for so long at this stage that it couldn't be that. I think you are right though that I need to ask my doctor about it."
"What is even more bizarre to me is the mom gets this text message, says ""don't be daft"" then doesn't hear from her daughter again and it takes 3 DAYS before anyone has gone to check on the woman and her very young child?"
"When I first went, I didn't really have to explain my situation myself it was just a series of questions I answered and then later on we would go deeper into my issues. I think this is generally how the first sessions go"
"Yeah sucks so bad. I actually have psychosis happen to me on a daily basis now because of the antidepressants I came off, which sucks so much. I get scared and jumpy over absolutely nothings it’s ridiculous I hate it. "
"You might end up getting a DM from me, I have social anxiety disorder so I'm still mulling it over lol. But I just wanna let you know that it's really kind of you to put yourself out there for other people and thank you."
"&gt;your illness
&gt; manic episode

When people tell me of bipolar mania, it sounds like they're effectively on drugs. Like, gamble your savings on bitcoin and rant about Reptilians in the goverment kind of on-drugs. It also lasts literal weeks to months to the point of impacting sleep.

I am literally just upbeat. Can't ruin my day, downers slide off me. Then wham bam, everything is shit and I am shit and I hate everything. Rinse and repeat at least once or twice a day."
"I have almost everything you listed, excepting the insane thoughts and marks. Instead of the need to always clean it is the need to reorganize everything in specific places. Well...

I have been looking for the symptoms but my google game is weak. 

Thanks for your comment. I seriously don’t want to go to a therapist saying “I think I was” and then turning out it is not. It’s a fear I have. I will look deeper into it. Then again, thanks for telling your symptoms. "
"I think it really depends on who you’re talking to. If it’s just a customer/employee interaction it’s mostly just to have a respectful conversation. Personally, I hate silence and appreciate good customer service so I am friendly while I work to make small talk for the brief time I am helping a customer. If it’s someone I feel comfortable with I usually just tell them how I feel and truly hope that when I ask they do the same with me. In both cases it is genuine. "
"This is what I wish my boyfriend would realize. He doesn't have a dependency on alcohol, but ever since he started his current job and drinking more frequently with his work ""friends"" he's become a different person. Any time I mention it he gets super defensive and accuses me of accusing him of being an alcoholic and deflects from what I'm actually trying to say: alcohol makes you a depressed asshole who takes out your issues on me. Go get real help, not from Dr. Ethanol."
"As a person on the Autism spectrum, I am appalled that someone thinks this somehow makes sense. There is way more to Autism than just Aspergers and your vague idea of Autism. Also, having poor social skills is not the same as Aspergers. Aspergers is something you are born with, but poor social skills can be developed without it. There are plenty of people, with or without Aspergers or any form of Autism who are violent towards themselves or others, as you have described. As people who work with, live with, and/or are on the spectrum often say: ""If you've met one person with Autism, you've met one person with Autism."" There are so many different ways Autism spectrum disorders can manifest even in cases of the same disorder."
"Thank you! 

I’ve got everything safety wise sorted at this point, I’m a family violence worker so I do this now for a living, which helps me strangely. But I’m always on the lookout and never go anywhere alone, if I’m walking it’s either with my partner or best friend both of which are male, which is important because my ex doesn’t respect females and only slightly more respects males. 

Yeah, I do believe he isn’t finished with me yet.. my new partner knows everything but often downplays just how bad and violent he is with everyone, I guess it’s hard to believe until you see it. 

I’m still haunted from it all, especially his weird superiority complex, he truly thought he was above the rest of mankind. "
"Maybe it's time to look for a new therapist? Idk how long you've been seeing her, but sometimes if we see the same person for a long time, it's not helpful anymore. Or maybe she just isn't the right fit. You should feel like your therapist is helping and understands where you're at.

"Your English is fine! And when it gets hard for me to start cleaning up I have to start small and make it easy. Start with good music! In my bedroom I’ll pretty much throw anything on the floor onto my bed (and if there’s garbage toss that obviously) and then start sorting from there. It makes it easier to me seeing the floor and then organizing from the bed. For other rooms I do the same if it’s the living room I’ll throw everything on the sofa, kitchen I’ll use the table, etc. Once you can see the floor it already feels like you’ve made a big dent. And organizing is a lot easier to do than cleaning in my opinion. So you start small and  then slowly just put everything away. It also gives you a goal if you put things where you’ll need later. Like I know I’ll finish my room because I need my bed to be cleared off to sleep later. It is definitely hard to start once you let it build up but it’s well worth it and you’ll feel a great sense of relief after :)"
"I hear ya.  Reading your post had me thinking it could've been written by my son (similar issue) a few years ago.

The good thing is you're aware of it, reaching out, and have a therapist.

I don't know if you have any interest, but my son had an ARMHS (skills worker) that had an office within the school and could work *outside* of the school too.  Check to see if your school has one, or your county.  Your therapist can help find one for ya.

Unlike a therapist, you can hang out with them outside of school and if those ""rage"" feelings pop up, they work with you in the moment it's happening and teach you skills to manage it.

For instance, my son was with his ""Coach"" at a fast food place, following a visit to a [Gamming Store].  Someone else eating there did something (not to my son) and my son gave his Coach the ""signal"" that he was feeling the way you had described in your Post.  His Coach got him through it. (I don't know the private details.)



I can tell you, with me and my Coach, it's practicing little things (how to deal with thoughts or skills) one at a time, then combining them until it's something you can achieve doing on your own.

   Like in a video game, or learning the ins and outs of a different consolue.(sp?)"
"Cheddar, the few behavioral symptoms you mention sound more like red flags for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) than bipolar.  Indeed, of the 157 mental disorders listed in DSM-5, BPD is the only one that has ""self harm such as cutting"" listed as a defining symptom.

Of  course,  learning  to spot BPD  warning  signs will  not  enable you  to diagnose your own  issues.   Although strong BPD  symptoms  may be easy to spot,  only a professional  can  determine  whether they  are so  severe  and  persistent as to  constitute a  full-blown disorder.

Yet,   like learning  warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning    those for BPD may  help you avoid a very painful situation.  Moreover,  it may give you the motivation you need to seek professional advice. I   am not a  psychologist but I did live with a BPD exW for 15 years and  I've taken  care of a bipolar-1 foster son for longer than that.    Moreover, I took  both of them to a long series of psychologists for 15  years. Based on  those experiences, I have found many clear differences  between the two  disorders.

**One difference** is that the mood swings are on two separate spectra having very different polar extremes.  A bipolar-1 sufferer swings between *mania* and *depression*  and a bipolar-2 sufferer swings between depression and normality   (i.e., with very little mania).  In contrast, a pwBPD flips back and forth   between *loving her partner* and *devaluing her partner*.

**A second difference**  is seen in the frequency of mood changes. Bipolar mood swings are   very   slow because they are caused by gradual changes in body   chemistry.  They  are considered rapid if as many as four occur in a   year. In  contrast,  four BPD mood changes can easily occur in four   days.  Granted, ultra-rapid cycling is possible with bipolar but is much less likely.

**A third difference**   is seen in duration. Whereas bipolar moods typically last at least a week or   two, BPD rages typically last only a few hours (and rarely as long as 36   hours).

**A fourth difference**    is seen in the speed with  which the mood change develops. Whereas a    bipolar change typically will  build slowly over two weeks, a BPD  change   typically occurs in less than a  minute -- often in only 10  seconds --   because it is event-triggered by  some innocent comment or  action.

**A fifth difference**    is  that, whereas bipolar can be treated fairly successfully in most  patients by swallowing a pill, BPD cannot be managed by   medication   because it arises from childhood damage to the emotional   core -- not   from a change in body chemistry.

**A sixth difference**    is  that, whereas bipolar disorder can cause people to be irritable   and   obnoxious during the manic phase, it typically does not rise to  the level of    meanness and vindictiveness you see when a pwBPD is  splitting you  black.   That difference can be HUGE:  while a manic  person may regard you as  an   irritation and an idiot, a pwBPD can  perceive you as Hitler and will treat you    accordingly.

**A seventh difference**    is that,  whereas a bipolar sufferer is not usually angry, a pwBPD is    filled with  anger that has been carried inside since early  childhood.    You only  have to say or do some minor thing to trigger a  sudden  release  of that  anger.

**An eight difference**    is that a bipolar sufferer  typically is capable of tolerating   intimacy  when he is not experiencing  strong mania or depression. In   contrast,  pwBPD have such a weak and  unstable self image that (except   for the  brief infatuation period) they cannot tolerate intimacy for   long before  feeling engulfed and suffocated  by your personality.

PwBPD therefore will create arguments over nothing as a way to push you away  and give them breathing room. Hence, it is not surprising that they  tend to create the very worst arguments immediately following the    very  best of times, i.e., right after an intimate evening or a great    weekend  spent together.  

**A ninth difference**    is that the  thinking and behavior of a BPDer includes more mental    departures from  reality (called ""dissociation"") wherein ""feelings    create facts.""  That  is, pwBPD typically do not intellectually    challenge their intense  feelings.  Instead, they accept them as    accurately reflecting your  intentions and motivations.

In    contrast, bipolar disorder tends to be  more neurotic in that the  mood   swings tend to be based more on extreme  exaggerations of fact,  not  the  creation of ""fact"" out of thin air based  solely on feelings.

**A tenth difference**    is that a  bipolar sufferer -- whether depressed or manic -- usually   is  able to  trust you if he or she knows you well. Untreated pwBPD, however, are  unable to trust for an extended period.  Before they can trust others,  they must first learn how to trust and love themselves.

**An eleventh difference**    is  that, whereas pwBPD are always convinced they are ""The Victim,""  bipolar  sufferers usually have a much stronger self image.  PwBPD  therefore  have a strong need to validate that false self image by    blaming every  misfortune on their partners.

**Finally, a twelfth difference**     is that, although bipolar sufferers are emotionally unstable, they     generally are not emotionally immature.  PwBPD, in contrast, are immature because they never had the opportunity to acquire coping skills (i.e., mature ego defenses) in early childhood.   This is why they have a very fragile self image and have great  difficulty controlling their emotions.  Fortunately, nearly all major cities offer excellent training programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach pwBPD those missing coping skills.

Cheddar, if this discussion rings bells and raises questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
"*ability for evil* what i mean: if i encounter evil (for example a bully that bullies just for the reason to make people suffer) i use my ability for ""bullying"" to make that person shut up and do something useful instead."
"Also I know what you are talking about. I call it brain slowsies. I know this isn't the right term. When it gets bad my sentences are a lot less coherent.  And I am not stupid, I got to university. They are just jumbled. "
As for tips? You may need to see behavior health... I suffer from extreme anxiety at times. And distraction is the best non medicinal alternative is what my shrink says. I use it as best Incan before resorting to a pill.
"Awesome that it has been helpful for you.  I didn't have any luck mental health wise with a keto diet (lost weight though), despite it being easily the best and most wholesome I had eaten over an extended period of time. "
Being sad is a big thing to try and break apart and uncover. The first step is always finding out the source of your sadness. I usually journal �� sounds clique but it helps your articulate your thoughts and feelings
"Do the activity for fun, getting nearsighted on skill or confidence opens up the viscous cycle.  Sometimes you just have to say ""fuck it"" and just have some fun, and probably increase confidence and skill in that as well."
"Even having an ego hasn't helped and has removed my favourite part of my personality which was being nice and selfless, so in trying to solve it I destroyed my own personality which has driven me to feeling a bit worse.

"
"Have you seen a doctor about this? If not, you need to go there and tell them what you're telling us right now. I've dealt with questioning reality before also. But the only way to get better is to get properly diagnosed."
I actually have this exact same thing happen to me. I have noticed my anxiety is 5 times better with sleep deprivation. It also negatively effects my job though. It’s just healthier to find other options in my opinion.
I agree.  I consider myself independent.  Now my sister does not do well without a responsible adult around.  We often talk about her since she is the only family I have left so I wonder if she was fishing for something?
"I echo what Zbinarycode (sorry can't write out all those 1s and 0s lol) says.  


Take time to love yourself, even if it is hard. It is ok to feel this way, and it too, shall pass. :) Hang in there and message me anytime."
"Just because the therapist is a nice caring person does not necessarily mean that they are the right one for you. It's ok to be picky, and it's ok to hold back as much as you feel like until you're comfortable with them. "
"No problem. Remember if you need a shoulder to cry on, I am here. I have been there. Take care of yourself and don't be ashamed if you need to go back and get more help. I would rather you get that help. Much love to you!"
"Set that aside. First girl, first, love, and shes your wife. I am not sure where to start. Sounds tricky. PM me your primary symptoms. Whays the actual problem.  

People don't really know themselves into thier 20s-30s..."
"That's really useful too. I never even think about my baseline and staying on course. I definitely could use some more consistency and probably greater effort in fighting this.

Edit: Yes, I'm feeling pretty creative too!"
"This won’t spontaneously go away. If it was going to resolve on its own, it would be gone already. Unfortunately a lot of people just make up nice lies when they see you’re freaked out. It’s time to take action dude"
You can warn someone about an abusive partner without armchair diagnosing someone (not only through the internet but *second-hand* through the internet) with a disorder that's difficult to diagnose even for professionals.
"I have a friend who just push her hair until the majority of it falls down. Same goes to me I had a bad habit of eating my nails until it hurt or bleed.

"Im bipolar ll but when im hypomanic i spend from 2 to 4 days with absolute no sleep, i talk an excessive amount but i do take advantage of it i do 1 months work in those days.

The meds i take are Depakote (mood stabilizer), ativan (for anxiety) and right now actually they prescribed to me Wellbutrin sr (i treats anxiety, improves concentration, decreases depression and more importantly has a really low chance of causing hypomania because it works in balance with Depakote)"
"Just be there for your friend... let him/her know that you care.  Don't pressure him/her to do anything.  Offer to get them stuff or just whatever they want.  

Make sure that they have any emergency plan, a list of people to call if they genuinely become suicidal.  The people on this list should know that they are on this list so that they know to answer their phone no matter what time it is.  Make sure that the suicide hotline number is on this list (it's #5 on my list)."
"Sounds like you picked quite a winner.  What a lucky girl you are?  I would start with a marriage counselor but I am far from an expert here.

Failing that, if you are in the US, try a mental health support group. These are for family and friends and for those whose loved ones don't think there is a problem.    There you will meet other people in similar circumstances and see what local resources are available.   Start here [NAMI support](https://www.nami.org/Find-Support)"
"Yes, totally. I'd like to clarify that it took a lot of hard work for me to build what is now a vaguely active lifestyle and I still have to fight the urge to give it all up and do nothing all the time. Eventually the pros outweigh the cons, but I don't mean to come across as though this came easily to me. I had to fight my natural urges very hard.

For me, staying single for a while was the key. It gave me no other choice. Relationships can make complacency very tempting."
"just an update, I felt better for awhile but, alot of the time my heart just feels weird or it's because I pulled alot of muscles in my chest working out/running but sometimes I lose confidence in the fact I'm gonna feel better about what I say because I'm still very traumitised and sad/angry that I couldn't do anything, and I was thinking maybe you could help me out a little and give me some tips... I know I'm asking for alot, but I really could use it right now 


please"
"Hi friend, another option for you (...in addition to this?) is to volunteer with Crisis Text Line. You do it from home on your computer 4 hours a week. They train you on listening skills and best practices, though as crisis counselors we don't give advice to people because we want them to be empowered to make their own choices (and because we don't know enough about their lives to make choices for them). So that might be a significantly different type of help than what you're looking to offer. 

We do provide people with longer-term resources and help them think through their problems and potential solutions. I'm just another volunteer with them and thought you'd be curious about it! Thanks for any reaching out that you do."
"Most of my childhood is hazy at best. No real trauma. I think doing a lot of drugs when I was younger (as an adult) didn't help. Also I feel like I used drugs to make drastic changes to myself, so perhaps I've lost a sense of who I was as a child and can't go back down the memory chain so well.

But in my case it's not so much that I have a missing area, more that it's all very vague and insignificant. I can't seem to ever feel a sense of nostalgia for my childhood. The things I do remember may as well be second hand memories.

I'd hope that the right kind of therapy can unlock things for both of us though. What another commenter said about asking trusted people to recount things to you also sounds like good advice I think."
"My Mom had recently died and I was already depressed, I just felt terrible all the time. At work, people asked how I was doing, I reply, “fine” and they’d put their two cents in as if they were my life coach and say crap like: 

•Why are you still sad? Get happy. 
•She’s in a better place. 
•Life goes on. 
•C’mon, smile. It’ll make you feel better. 
•It was her time. 
•It was God’s plan. 

My Mom was an Atheist like me. That just pissed me off. I was suicidal for a long time... much more stable and aware these days. Off of medication that made me feel sick. My work actually laid me off this Spring—no more work available. It was their excuse to not be responsible for someone who was mentally ill. "
"Professional help is definitely needed, and hopeful they might be able to find a different pill combo that might work.

It is a gamble, and I can't guarantee it will pay off, but from a person who has been in that position I can tell you that for me it opened up such a well of guilt and misery that I couldn't bear to inflict pain on those I love again. In my position, I'm desperate to salvage and repent and that kind of offers a chance of stability and building up from my point of view.

If you believe in your heart you can forgive him and live with it, I would say it's definitely worth trying at least. Forgiveness is a great healer, and could be the start of you guys being stronger than ever. I wish you the best of luck :)"
"Yes, I would definitely see a doctor about it, it sounds like something like antidepressants may be good for you. Obviously, things like this are what to do to help an illness
That being said, I’ve found the things that has made me most at peace with life is helping people. And make sure it’s in a way where you can see the person your helping’s reaction. It makes everything more meaningful.
After my experiences with Psychosis, Depression, Bulimia, and Anxiety, i was able to share my story with campers at a middle school christian camp, and I possibly saved this one girl’s life. That... gives life meaning again. 
So, all in all, i would recommend seeing a doctor, but to feel happier about life in general, help people"
"if it's really that bad, keep your focus on the long term. Not even the long term - the short term. The immediate future may look dim, but think of it like this: EVERYONE, and I mean everyone, goes through shit in their lives. You are no exception. It sucks. However, it's always temporary, especially in your case. When you hit 18, she has no legal authority over you. That's less than 365 days away. Mark a calendar with ""freedom"" on it. Do what you need to do to get to that day. Plan in advance...i.e. college, job, being self sustaining. If your mom truly cares about you, she will reach out to you after 'x' amount of time of you being on your own. Then you can set all the guidelines on your own terms. That's what I would do."
"From the university one I've been to, they had a checklist type form for mental health questions you fill out in the waiting area.  I imagine either the receptionist would give you one, or the doctor would ask them to you themself in a regular walk-in.

When I went in, they paired me with one for a tentative start, basically seeing how I'd work with them.  If you go in again, its not going to be out of the question to end up with the same one if you go into a walk-in a second time.

As for which one you need, personally I think making the wrong call (or in this case, the less efficient call?) isn't as important as making A call at all.  If you need a clinic to get started on the path to fixing yourself, then go out and do so.  Or just say ""fuck it"" and try a pro to start out.  

Consider finances of course, but as long as you can afford it consider just making a call and going out and getting it started, and soon enough you'll get a feeling which one would be better for you."
"What's going on inside you is that your body is secreting chemicals that circulate in your bloodstream and cause you to feel anxious, the so-called ""fight or flight"" response. These are not fun feelings, but they are real. What happens is that NOBODY'S body can stay at that high energy/anxiety level forever, and that eventually your body naturally calms down.  What happened, and how you developed this avoidant personality, is that you ran away when confronted with stressful situations. Your bloodstream got back to normal and you felt better, physically. What you didn't know is that, if you'd just have stayed there and stuck out the stressful situation, that your body would return to normal, and you wouldn't have had to miss out on whatever was going on that you ran away from.  Choose to be brave or be alone. It's going to be a constant struggle for you until you cure yourself. Good news is that you can cure yourself. Bad news is that nobody else can do it for you. Good luck."
"What you're saying is true - no, they don't understand us and we shouldn't expect them to. Our minds are different from theirs, from the make up of our perception of the world to the chemical imbalances that you mentioned. Lets compare this to another example of minds being different - men and women have different minds and different hormones but a woman can never understand what it is to be a man and a man can never understand what it is to be a woman. If women assumed that asking men a few questions about how they feel as males would completely show they what it is to live as a man, they would be very disappointed. You need to understand that a few descriptions of how you feel, no matter how detailed, will never show them what it really is to live with the challenges that you do. Don't put unrealistic expectations on other people or you'll set yourself up for disappointment. My advice is to be around people that don't focus on your mental health, or better yet don't even know about it. Try to escape for a while. It would also be helpful to teach someone, maybe 5 years old, something that you're good at and enjoy. Oh, and get a pet! Animals and children are so innocent, they can really light up the rainiest days. Goodluck :)"
Adderall twice a day. This has been the only thing that has helped me with this problem and I have tried different therapy suggested techniques and other medications but this has been the only thing to help significantly.
"I agree. I see a LOT of myself in the OP. I was just diagnosed as suffering from Pyromania, and it has been a wild ride for months and months. I never thought I would find another person like me here. I can relate so much."
"I don't find this odd or ""out there"" at all. My mind messes with me constantly. I would talk to someone about this. There may be something they can suggest to shut that voice up. :) Good luck and \*hugzzzzz\*

"I'd suggest seeing a therapist instead of a psychiatrist for a bit. Psychiatrists are not typically as warm and open - they're medical doctors. Their job is to diagnose an prescribe treatment, not be part of the treatment."
"Keep in mind that school counselors don't provide regular therapy anyway, but they can definitely be the stepping stone to getting the help you need. If you're diagnosed they can help you set up a 504 plan or IEP to help. "

"That’s a good strategy. In my experience doctors seem much more understanding about mental health issues than they were 10 years or so ago. They will probably want to do regular check ups with you, just a  fair warning. "
"The real question is why do abusers expect no repercussions? The short answer is, there often aren't many. Gender has nothing to do with it. Abusers wouldn't be abusers if they weren't also good at avoiding repercussions. "
"This is a documented side-effect of withdrawal from this class of medications.

"Yes. You typically need a referral from a regular doctor to see a psychiatrist. So schedule an appointment with your general practitioner first.



Edit: But if it's an emergency, then you need to take him to the hospital."
You just need to stop worrying about how other's perceive you. That's the number one thing right there. Just do what makes you happy. And ignore the people who try to drag you down. Don't waste your time with toxic people.
"You're an idiot because you're telling someone with existential anxiety to watch things die...

You didn't know that, but it's stupid to tell anyone with a mental illness to just ""toughen up"" because obviously we've tried."
"How are you with confrontations or conflict resolution in general and specifically with your parents? Perhaps the reason your brain jumps to contemplating suicide right away in the face of conflict is because you get too overwhelmed / have poor skills to resolve conflict and/or have strong avoidance tendencies, so you just wanna get away ASAP. Suicide would make all issues nonexistent, as there would be no life. Are your parents really mean? Is there healthy communication? "
"I feel like that's not right. Its invading. Say they were to be spying and this family member does try or succeed in ending his/her life.. What impression does that leave? If it's something they want to do, who are you to stop them? It may hurt you, but living is clearly making that person suffer. All you can do is to do your best to make the days for that family member go by easier and happier. Even if it's temporary. (My ""you"" is just a general use, not implying yourself)"
"She tells me that she was leaving cause it was selfish of her to keep stringing me on. But when you’re married that means that, like you say, you come to one another with your problems and support each other. 

I’m not  going to speak of behalf of women everywhere, but it my case, you are bang on! Whenever she couldn’t  couldn’t understand my feelings during arguments, I just told her to imagine how she’d be feeling in that scenario, but I don’t think she got it"
"I am very much that kind of a person, I try to look at everything in an objective which causes me to try to supress feeling either because they don’t make sense objectlivly, or I’m just scared they’ll hurt. One more thing I don’t feel are butterflies, I met this girl the other day at my place and where I would have felt really happy and giddy, I felt nothing much at all. I supose this makes sense in a way that it could come from there, I miss that excitment of talking to someone and really really liking it, to actually have a crush that makes you feel those butterflies.

Emotions for me have always been a think that kinda scares me I supose, but I’ve never thought that they would affect me in a long term kinda way."
"I had a ""friend"" like this in high school. We were friends since middle school and then out of nowhere she dropped me because my mental illness was toxic according to her and her family. I defended myself because I knew she didn't understand and that I did nothing wrong to her. Yes people you love get exhausted from our pain but the real ones will always find strength eventually to help you. Like my bf told me if he has a stressful day then he just needs a break from me and everyone. There are ways to handle friends and loved ones who are constantly sick so honestly fuck your ex friend. They probably have issues of their own for sure but they could have handle the situation better by just saying they needed a break from you "
"I’m not in your country but I have had about 10 therapists in my life time. Some were good, some were bad for me. I suggest that you view the situation as you are interviewing them. You can let them know you’d like to meet in person to determine if you think there is strong potential for a therapeutic relationship and also be upfront that you have been through painful things and are not interested in sharing these things until a relationship has been established. You set the terms, you know? Ask them a lot of questions too about their methods and beliefs and why they wanted to become a therapist. You can ask to speak on the phone before you meet to ask them some questions and see if you have a good feeling about them. 

"
"So they'll just give a non-blunt *don't do it*? I've looked at threads there before; most of it is people venting, people there want sympathy and that's what they get. There are a lot of kids and people without serious issues who are just down. Not as many people with lifelong, debilitating illnesses that seriously hurt their quality of life.  

I don't see the point to venting, personally. I know it helps others, but it's never made me feel better. I only care about solutions and I don't want sympathy or support. That does not change your life. I want a place where something like this can be spoken about rationally and objectively, because it's hard to process something like this completely on my own and decide what's best."
"Try seeing a therapist. They aren't just for treating mental disorders; they're also there to help you become the person you want to be. At the very least, a consultation with one could point you in the right direction for you to do the personality and behavioral work on your own. Your school may even have a free counselor on staff to help with everything from learning and concentration issues to the serious stuff. If you're dead set on not seeing one, try starting a journal and making an inventory of the ways you've changed and the steps you want to take to change those traits. But, if you find yourself getting stuck on how to change at that point, you might need help. There's no shame in getting advice from a professional."
"&gt;Then my thoughts would go from normal to frantic. Like I'd think ""I  wonder what time it is"" and the voice thinking it wouldn't be calm and  normal, it would be like someone freaking out. Every single thought.  Freaking out ~~lady~~ boy in my head. But the thoughts weren't different in  content than usual, just screaming and panicked in tone.

I also have to point out that along with your description of time weirding out, the above quote so accurately describes my internal headspace during an episode. I've noticed too that it was different from just ""being panicked"" There were times in my teens where I could keep myself *relatively* calm during a freakout, but one of the prominent factors of it was my head was doing this weird frantic thing that you describe here. It wasn't really associated with my sense of fear or panic at all, it was more of a switch into this manic mental state. The way you describe it here explains it well.

So thank you for sharing that with me too."
"I already recklessly drive and it's one of the few things I find fun, so I'm glad you mentioned that. I was meeting a bunch of strangers and having unprotected sex just for the risk for the past two months, but it got boring. I've been wanting to try hitchhiking but I dislike the idea of someone else making the decision for me, so I'm still thinking about it.  


I was planning on going to meet a girl overseas only having known her for a few weeks. She has ASPD too and the uncertainty of whether or not she's luring me into something, or leading me somewhere just to get a laugh is great. Though I think it's genuine, I'm still not sure if I'm going or just ending it. I'm going to plan the trip, which was in two weeks anyway. I get the fentanyl around the time I'd ideally take the trip overseas. That trip has been the one reason against the suicide but the want to end it is overpowering it by quite a bit; my mind is almost certainly made up, though a lot can happen in two weeks."
"I am similar to you. But here is the thing I’ve discovered; you have to ask for these things. If you wanted a friend to come over with ice cream, you have to ask a friend to do that. The friends that just know, well, that’s not common. Not impossible, but certainly not the norm. 

I came from an abusive home, and I was always trying to forge my own way without showing I was vulnerable, without asking for help because I grew up in an environment where asking for help always came with strings, where being vulnerable was showing a weakness that family could exploit. So I thought I had to do it all on my own.

I had friends. But I didn’t have close friends. It wasn’t until my life came crumbling down around me that I learned no, sometimes you can’t do it all on your own and you need to admit you need other people to those people.

I still struggle with it. Old habits die hard. But it seems like every time I fall down, it’s because I’ve forgotten these lessons again."
"Personal example. Mother started a daycare when I was around 5. She still runs it and I'm 26. Growing up my father was always working so before school and after school is be at my mother's daycare until she was closed. Because I was older than many if the younger kids I was always told to help, little things when I was younger but more responsibilities as I got older. Got to always watch my mother hold and cuddle and care for these young kids while I stayed out of the way and kept quiet. When she would close for the day (daycare was done out of a second house) I'd go home with her (obviously) where I'd again have to do more chores. Keep quiet and leave my mother alone. All I wanted was to just be hugged by my mother or even to just sit next to her and spend time with her. But because she did that all day with other kids she just wanted alone time until my dad was home from work. Then he'd get home and criticize all the chores I did because they were never perfect, eat dinner then go to room for the rest of the night. Have an older sister but she never wanted anything to do with her little brother so I rarely interacted with her. 

Not outright psychological abuse but in an indirect manner it is. Took years to accept that and several therapists all saying that intentional or not it is still abuse. Now I never went hungry or was physically abused, my family wasn't rich but were not poor, but I guess this is the best way I can describe what psychological abuse is. At least to me  "
"You're doing the right thing asking for help, but I'm afraid trying to make him feel better won't be very helpful. You should _definitely_ be there for him, be nice and everything, but depression is not the absense of happiness, it's the conscious or unconscious repression of something personal. This cab really be anything, from missing his study years, maybe for feeling like the ""fun"" parts of life are now over, or maybe he got bullied 12 years ago and it's affecting him on a subconscious level. Maybe he's repressing shame about something.

Really, it could be anything, he's avoiding, or repressing, or doesn't know how to properly process certain feelings he may not even be aware of. The goal you should be working toward is figuring out what's really going behind the scenes, and letting him process his issues in an adequate manner.
Note that this isn't easy at all, and it could take months, even in a supportive setting with friends, you, potentially a therapist, ... There might be hard feelings involved. And it's possible he literally ha has no idea what actually is going on. This is mostly _his_ problem, you can only be there too support him and guide him if he wants to work on it.

Ie; the goal is more akin to helping him feel _actual_ sadness, or anger, or something, much rather than helping him feel happy.
Happiness will come afterwards.

"i was diagnosed w/schizophrenia NOS around 4 years ago after my first episode of psychosis, since then i had another episode a few months ago. the first was more intense, what snapped me out of delusional thinking was discussing my experience very honestly with the psychiatrists i was seeing. 
it can be hard to regain footing in Reality, i recommend focusing on basic self care, getting enough sleep, feeding yourself, take a daily multivitamin, go for walks. reach out to your closest loved one (for me it’s my mom). maybe it’s hard to describe exactly what is happening but you can cry in their presence...be accepting of the care you receive 
maybe instead of following the delusional thinking inside your head and just being locked in there you write it down in a journal/on your phone. makes it easier to analyze or see what next step you need to take 
my second episode got me very focused on religion, its helpful to pray routinely 
as for ‘cognitive impairment’ try to focus on the things you can do and give yourself time and space to make mistakes. it was hard for me to drive too, i had to take time off my internship and i notified my supervisor of my condition. she was very understanding fortunately. 
as for suicidal thoughts, i remind myself that if i killed myself that would make me a murderer which is wrong, i also have to live for my younger brother, plus in my religion suicide is forbidden. 
it also helps to connect with nature, take walks, spend time with your pet

"Yes, the general public still has a very close-minded, rationalized view of mental illness. It also tends to be romanticizing, so I'm not sure the genuine awareness is really broadly spread.

Once people apply the label of mental illness to someone, they treat them accordingly. But they don't tolerate the symptoms and behaviors of mentally ill people before recognizing the mental illness. The less common/stereotypical the mental illness outs itself, the less sympathy you will receive. People will only start treating you respectfully once they have an ""explanation"" for what would otherwise be regarded as despicable character flaw. It's even worse for incurable or prolonged issues.

My best friend and I are both depressed, socially anxious and gifted. Same diagnosis, but varying symptoms and very different high school experiences due to that:

She cut herself, cried in class and constantly put herself down. As soon as our schoolmates figured she was depressed, they felt sorry and showed sympathy. Teachers picked up on her self-loathing and rewarded it as ""modesty"" or ""ambition"". While they wanted her to get better, people encouraged her perfectionism, since they romanticized that symptom like it was an admirable trait. She is still struggling really hard to be satisfied with herself.

Meanwhile I went mute, distrusted everyone, constantly got outbreaks of nervous sweating and had mood swings that made my academic performance drop from ambitious to careless in the course of a week. I was just the person in the background, not living up to his potential, the weird kid noone wanted to sit next to. I spent whole weeks chilling in the corner without ever talking and teachers wouldn't even notice whether I was missing. The bullying and isolation sucked, but at least the lack of attention gave me room to observe and reflect for myself. Essentially it made me realize how people still just see what they want to see, and will only tolerate mentally ill people they (illegitimately) relate to."
"A lot of the time, people who are suicidal are very good at hiding it and WANT to hide it because they don't want anyone to stop them. How does pinning the blame on other people help anybody? All it does is cause more hurt."

Id rather have a very dry mouth than ve very drowsy with anxiety and a headache. Thats my opinion.

"This is a mental disposition and I am not qualified to diagnose exactly what it is. The best thing you could do would be to find a therapist to talk to, who could help you identify what's going on and help you cope with it."
"This is why mental illness is so difficult.

Because the illness itself causes beliefs like having no worth and is also usually the source of the sort of self-blame seen here.

You could probably tell her. I get why you’re not totally comfortable with someone only a few years older than you and inexperienced. You can try to get a new therapist. Don’t stick with her if you’re not comfortable

"Patients with ADHD that do not receive treatment have worse outcomes than those who don’t. They’re more likely to go on to develop substance abuse issues and impulse control problems that negatively affect their lives. It has to be a disorder for it to be treated. If you look at study after study(valid ones), people with adhd are far less likely to function normally in our society without pharmacological treatments.

"Tell me about it. I've been prescribed so many different medications, and the only thing that ever worked consistently was Klonopin. Now, my tolerance is shot, and it doesn't work anymore. In fact, NONE of the benzos work. My pdoc and I have been through everything. I did manage to get a day or two of relief from Librium (which was the first benzo discovered), but even that doesn't work anymore. I'm already on a bunch of SSRIs, so I really don't have an option but to suffer."
"Thank you for your response! We did attend one couples therapy session but he didn’t want to return. The therapist said that I was not cheating and I think that upset him. 

I brought a third party into it today- my little sister who lives with me. She said she didn’t understand how he believed I was doing these things. It just seemed to aggravate him more. 

The kids and I are safe because he is so antisocial. We don’t see him all day unless I need to go to my room.

"This is a tough problem and I do think you should seek help again. It's hard to say if you should bring up your previous experience, it would really depend on the Dr. I will tell you someone I know as diagnosed with BPD and another doctor later changed it to Generalized anxiety disorder and recurrent major depression. I myself have had my diagnosis changed through the years. 

No matter what I wish you good luck, mental health problems are tough without this added stress.

"Well, in that case i will double down.  

I think it is perfectly fine to hold on to these boxes and you should rather accept them into your life, be happy with them and ignore what everybody else is saying.  
It sounds like they bring you only happiness and only other people bug you about them, do not let other get into your head.  

When they make your life worse at some point in the future, only then i would think about throwing some of it away.  
Until then, be happy! :)"
"Sadly one persons experience isn't the same as yours. Since you're diagnosed I presume you have a psychologist? Talk to them about it, 

The only real advice I can give you is to be open and clear with him. Talk about what's difficult for you what problems you run into. And don't brush things off on your illness I know that sounds harsh. 

However by I don't mean blame everything on yourself. Just tell him that something is hard for you to do or remember. And ask him to remind you or help you with it. I wouldn't recommend recommend telling him to do certain stuff you find hard. Tell him it's hard for you and do them together. 

I really hope your psychologist can give you better information about it. Just be open and honest. "
"Yea, I hate that. I feel like writing the letter is just another step along the way I could second guess the idea. I really don't want to wait six months. The problem with me is that it's really difficult to care about anyone with my condition. The only people I care about are the people I grew up with, the people I've known since childhood, and that number is going down as time goes on.  


I wish I cared enough about people to use them as a motivation to get out of this. I wish I cared enough about anything to enjoy it. So many people say they don't care like it's this tough guy thing but it's a curse. Really not caring has got me nowhere but lower and lower the less I care; and I cannot control it no matter how hard I try."
"You can talk to her about it, just like you can talk about anything in therapy. And if you want or need a new therapist for any reason at all, you can ask for that. She’ll be understanding. I spoke to a clinical psychologist who started practicing at about 25, and she told me she had a number of clients request new psychologists because of her age. When they were close to her age it was generally for reasons like you’ve said. She said she totally got it and it’s her job to do what is best for the client. I’m 23 and I don’t think I would feel comfortable seeing a therapist close to my age. And, you could speak to her about this (or not), and see her a couple more times, and be totally okay and ready to work with her."
"I have a diagnosis of  major depression and want to be a police officer. Been told by a few cops it'll make it harder for me to get hired, but not impossible if I stick to it and take care of myself. 

There are some careers allowed to discriminate based on mental illness and who require you show them your medical records. Police is one, fire departments, corrections, federal law enforcement, some lawyer positions, and military. But in every single one of these cases mental illness is a CONDITIONAL disqualification. meaning if you take care of it and your symptoms it should not hold you back. 

In my opinion it's better to get the help you need and get your issues under control that to suffer and let them potentially get out of control. Doing that will only make your career prospects worse in the long run. 

This is something I obsess about a lot when I'm depressed, so I hear you. But a diagnosis and medication shouldn't make you ineligible for any position to my knowledge.

"This is not nearly as serious as self-harming but I hope it makes a good analogy/comparison to give you something to think about... I bite my nails pretty bad (I deal with anxiety). I got a polish that makes my fingers taste bad enough that it helps me get them to grow. I've gone without biting them for a few months, had them nice colors etc. But then again sometimes I'll ""have a relapse"" too. Maybe I was nervous about something, forgot/stopped putting that polish on, etc. Suddenly all nails are gone, fingers hurting/bleeding and hands looking like crap. Well..spilled milk I guess. Starting over. I'm only human after all.

The road to success isn't a straight-line, especially with mental health. It may happen, you will have ups and downs. Forgive yourself for the tripping and keep going. Make sure you have back up ways of coping when you get the urge (I chew several pieces of gum together to make my jaw so tired I won't think of biting my nails)

Good luck and don't give up!\~"
"A piece of advice from someone a decade or so older, (this is just my experience, take it FWIW, which is nothing cuz I’m a stranger). 

I was extremely depressed since 12. Told parents about suicidal thoughts because my mom was called by the school counselor because my middle school girlfriend told the counselor she was worried about my thoughts. That was short lived, and I hid it after that. It got worse, and developed into severe anxiety over the next few years, amplifying in intensity beginning with going to college at 18. 

I didn’t talk to my parents about it until the past year, and all they wanted to do was help. I understand not wanting or feeling comfortable asking for help. I hate doing it. But you’re accurately recognizing that you need some help. Your thoughts are an illness. You need to treat it as such to have a good quality of life. 

Also, quite often people develop or increase in severity their mental illness in their 18-25 yes, particularly men. 

I had a lot of suicidal thoughts as a child, but since starting therapy around 20 and medication those have mostly subsided. It was the return of suicidal thoughts recently for the first time in years that indicated to me I was in a real out of balanced state. "
"I'm diagnosed as borderline. I was pretty offended when I heard this but understanding the disorder has really helped me understand what's going on and at least a bit of the ""why?"" IMO I wouldn't bring it up, at least at first, because putting an idea into someone's head may subconsciously drive them toward that even if they hadn't thought of it before. I highly recommend seeking some sort of therapy and possibly down the line after gaining a relationship with the therapist, bring up your concerns about it. 

If you do happen to be diagnosed, you are not your disorder. It just means you have very, VERY strong feelings that need to be worked on and dealt with. (Everyone needs this to some extent anyway.) 

On the other hand, borderline isn't really understood by a lot of mental health professionals and it's sometimes easier to diagnose a patient as borderline because the criteria is broad. There's even discussion about changing the name of it. 

Try not to focus so much on a diagnosis or the prospect of a diagnosis. Just work on what you need to work on and go from there. One day at a time, since that's all you can do even though it's frustrating. My inbox is open if you want to talk, vent, or want some more information on it.  "
"You just have to remember that you did all you could do. There's nothing else you could have done about it. There are some sick, twisted people out there who enjoy exploiting others. And they deserve to be behind bars. And reporting it is the only thing you could have done.

I don't blame you for being traumatized about it still. I'd say that's pretty normal. There's a good chance that it'll take awhile for you to get over it. But the only thing you can do is remember that you're not the person to blame for that video. You're not the person to blame. You reported it and that's all you could've done.

Keep working out and running. That might help you take your mind off it. If it's really bothering you still, then you need to keep yourself distracted until you're able to heal from it. Even if it's just browsing reddit, that's still a distraction that'll help take your mind off it. Keep your mind preoccupied until you're able to get over it. But at the same time it's okay to be sad and upset about it. Getting these emotions out of your system is part of the healing process.

You'll be fine eventually. And I apologize if this didn't help very much. But feel free to message me in the future if you ever need to. I'll always respond.

"1000000%. My anxiety hits the roof for days after drinking. Try not to drink too damn much. I know its hard, especially if you’re in college. But it’s either that or put up with crippling anxiety for days after a binge. "
Autism and/ or adhd could explain this. You could get some psych testing done to determine this and possibly work with someone to learn better social /communication skills and/ or take medicine to help w focus and attention
I can relate to ur silent. But I realize the more I isolate my self the more it get worse. So I sugget that u try to make a social contact with ppl more than u do now. It will force u to talk and get out of ur comfort zone.

"Yes. Therapy can make a difference. Go in with an open mind, and work WITH the therapist. It's a two way street. You are allowed to ask questions as well, and not blindly follow what a therapist might suggest you do or try. "
"A big part of the problem is the people who refuse to listen, pointing fingers at you that you are the reason and making it worse instead of helping. Everyone will appreciate the help/advice rather than criticism, I'd rather people tell me whats wrong and how to fix it rather than pointing fingers and just talking nonsense. If I didn't listen to it then thats another case. 

Thanks for the nice post OP, it helps a little finding out that someone out there is thinking the same"
"I’m introverted but I don’t struggle with social anxiety. Being around people exhausts me, whereas my extroverted friends are energized by others. My kid’s social anxiety is a different animal. It’s debilitating for her right now but we’re getting help. All you can do is try every day, but if you’re not able to try (severe panic attacks) —that’s when you need to find the right kind of help.  She will probably need pretty intensive therapy &amp; family therapy."
"People who have BPD dont self diagnose themselves and are unstable at everything. You don't seem to have it since you checked it.

That disorder is caused by stress it called disassociation it happens to everyone its a step above being spaced out.

It doesn't cause any issues neither does it develop into anything else.
If you want any advice go to a psychologist and they'll help you understand it.

"The only way to know for sure is to go see a doctor. Yes, it does sound like you might have some sort of anxiety disorder. But you'll need a proper diagnosis to know for sure. You might think that going to a doctor just for anxiety problems is a waste of time. But I can tell you right now that there's always a chance that it could get worse. And at your age, you don't want to miss out on experiences dealing with this. It doesn't hurt to talk to a doctor. Just to play it safe."
"FWIW I’m depressed and when I’m really struggling I don’t take care of basic necessities. I skip showering, I oversleep, my apartment gets messy and dishes and laundry pile up and I live in chaos day to day. Once I’m less depressed it takes me a week or so to clean everything up fully still. I just have very limited mental resources and have to ration them wisely. I drive for work, and I had expired car tabs for 3 months and my car insurance got cancelled for non payment for two weeks. I stack mail up rather than opening it because it’s depressing news. 

Also being away from work will definitely increase anxiety in my experience because your social skills degrade in some sense I believe when not used as much daily. "
"If I had to give one piece of advice to someone living with BPD, it'd be that it's not your fault that you have BPD, but it is your responsibility to change. I am infinitely empathetic to what you have to go through. Though I don't have BPD, I've been through something extremely similar and I know that it can be like living in hell. The good news is that you can change and you can be happy-- happier than you ever thought you could be.

Focus on yourself and your therapy (likely DBT and boundary skill building.) Think introspectively and critically about the traits you need to change, but remember to be gentle and kind to yourself. You are a person who is valid and deserves to be loved. I wish you hope, peace and healing ❤️"
"It seems like you’re asking if you’re overreacting or if this might be something they didn’t mean to do. Remember that there is no standard for how you “should” feel about anything. This is how I felt, and still sometimes feel, about an abusive relationship I was in that ended a year ago. In my case, there was a lot of gaslighting and denial on his part and a lot of self doubt on my part as a result. It could be that I was a bit more sensitive to that kind of abuse than the average person, but that’s no reason for it to be less valid. Either way, it hurt and it matched the definition of abuse. You can get help without it being about whose fault everything was. Same goes for your situation. Get help, you deserve it."
"Its very important that you are open and honest about yourself and your situation. If you cant spill the beans on the darkest corners or loneliest pits of your mind with a therapist then who is there that you can talk to about it? Just saying. Note that not all therapists are good. Some people can get very bad advice which can further traumatize them. I would suggest asking questions in your initial sessions to see what their approaches are and see if you would be a good fit for their style. I found one who knows a great deal about trauma and the long term effects of bad parenting which works for me, it might not work for the next guy. Remember that you are paying them and you should be getting the help from the right person. "
"Thank you so much, I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply back faster but I was with my friend.

I would love some recommendations. I bought a loved one a book yesterday (*No Mud No Lotus*) and got myself *First, We Make the Beast Beautiful by Sarah Wilson*. If you have any suggestions, I would happily take them.

Thank you. I'm seeing my psychiatrist today, and I think I'm going to ask him more practical tips for handling my mental health in certain situations.

**ADD**: Also thank you for your incredibly kind words. Seriously. 
I wish I could describe how *real* it feels when a relative stranger who's only connected to me via strange algorithms and computer wizardry, reaches out and empathizes. I hope you're also doing okay. &lt;3"
"If you think it will help, you can do the k10, it's a quick questionaire that
Say you do have depression, that's okay, it's very common and it's not your  fault. But we do have the power to change our brains,with little things everyday.

Exercise, eating well and meditation and sleep will all help. Make your bed. Do these every day.

Talking also helps. Well done for reaching out here. Try to talk to someone in real life. 
Youre not alone. Lots of people go through depression. If we take the steps to help ourselves, it can feel like it was never there sooner rather than later, but it's up to  us to take those steps :)

Do something. Anything. Write, draw, dance, sing, talk. It'll get the ball rolling :)
Seek professional help. It'll give you support and strategies to work through shitty thought patterns! The  first professional might not be the right fit, but if you keep trying you'll find one that works.

Its no quick fix, but its the little things that make life good anyway! "
"Sounds toxic. You sure you want to be with him?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing; people with this sort of complicated way of treating other people can probably change if they want to... but they have to want to. More than just that, change from that much damage is hard work (Im speaking from experience, not speculating about that). Its not easy. It takes time and effort. Followed by more time and effort. Ongoingly.

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion would be to see if he's open to that, and make your own assessment about whether you think he's capable of the self-reflection and of making himself vulnerable to doing the work. If you have doubts - if you dont think hed be capable -  you might want to rethink your longer term goals, in regard to whether you are better off - or not - to include him in them.... Because if he doesnt want to change, what you have is what you have got. And it could get worse, depending on what circumstances life hands him to have to deal with going forward. "
"That’s exactly how I feel and what I think. Like, my dad is a rougher old man but I still (rarely) see him show his love and compassion towards certain things, very rarely me or my brothers which is painful, but he shows it when he’s doing certain things or talking about some stuff. So when I’m a little more clear or not as bad or whatever you want to call it and I’m thinking more logically, I know that my dad wouldn’t laugh in my face. I know that he would show that same love and compassion and probably pain when I told him. He may take me to a actual professional and have them fully diagnose me, or he may diagnose me himself (he’s a doc but not in mental health.) and try to prescribe me some kind of pills to help, but still I know that he would most likely help. But when I’m bad and really need to reach out to him the most, all the doubts come back and clog my head. All I can think is him laughing at me, calling me some names, or maybe just saying suck it up because we all go through it. It’s dumb. 

I watched some videos that someone else linked in here, and high functioning depression or dysthymia is exactly what I’m feeling. My heart started racing and my head felt “clearer”, in a way, and I feel like that’s what I have. I feel more certain with a label, and now I’m hoping that I’m not just jumping on this since it sounds similar so that I feel better. I don’t know. It’s the closest thing I’ve ever found to what I feel, so I hope I found it."
"I did some pretty basic talk therapy, because that's been what I get things out of. Just talking with the therapist helped. She helped me with a lot of exercises like positive self talk, journaling my experiences, taking up regular exercise. 

A lot of my issues at that time stemmed from my undiagnosed ADHD, which I had suspected and she independently confirmed. She helped me work on getting more organized in how I approached my work and my days. A lot more of my issues came from stress on my relationships with friends, and she talked those out with me and encouraged me to set boundaries and be honest with friends about how much I could emotionally support them at any given time. (I love my friends, but most of our interactions were centered around them venting about their depression and leaning on me really hard as a replacement for seeing a professional. It had been going on for almost a decade nonstop and I was terrified that I would miss a call at 3am from an upset friend and that if anything happened it would be my fault. It made for poor sleeping habits and compounded my own depression, since that was the only interaction I had with those particular friends.) 

Just talking with a professional about the situation made my reactions feel more reasonable, I guess? And like it was okay to step away from something for awhile if I needed time. Basically, she helped me realize some truths about myself and she pressed me on what I wanted, which helped me set my own goals. I'm in a much better place now, pursuing a different job that I love, getting back into school, etc.

There's all kind of different approaches to therapy, to be honest. That's the experience I've had so far, but I'm looking to pursue a more clearly-defined CBT- or DBT-based treatment. I think the structure and the focus on changing behaviors and thoughts will help me better manage my ADHD and my depression, though .

If you do decide to look into therapy and feel like you're not clicking with the therapist, or they aren't helping you the way you want, don't be afraid to say ""thanks for your help but I just don't think we're a good fit"" or even ""thank you, but I would like to cancel my future appointments for personal reasons"" and try someone new. Every therapist isn't going to fit with every client (I had a therapist in middle school that a) didn't pick up on my ADHD and b) took me to a horse farm to explain how human social groups work so, I mean, it's all about using your best judgement to find someone you like).

Sorry this response is so long, but I wanted to be thorough. Therapy can be a little nerve racking to start, but I've found it very useful and effective in helping me regain control of my emotions. If you have any more questions I'd be happy to answer them."
"&gt; Sadly, the people I’m referring to are family members and removing them at this point in time isn’t exactly possible.

"Did your physical symptoms become easier to deal with as the medication began to work? My symptoms are triggering my “health anxiety”... lol, especially the physical symptoms! 

Why did you decide to stop after 6 months? "
"I live in the country/have citizenship/speak language so it's a very different situation. This policy applies mostly to USA, so I am not sure how helpful that is. I would find out in advance what the terms are to the service "
"I take a couple minutes out of each morning and make a list of 3-5 things I want to accomplish before I go to bed. Doesn’t matter how small or large they are, just gotta finish it. Definitely helps me with my anxious mind! "
I'm currently on social security because of my mental health. That's how bad it's gotten over the past few years. And that's why it hurt me so much that people didn't understand what I was going through when it first started.
"I've been where you are at, and rather recently as well. You should look into therapy if you have not already, specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is designed to rewire you brain into think more positively."
"If you don't change then be ready for an awful life ahead. As a fellow teen, you are NOTHING special. I don't want to make you feel bad but you sound like a shitty person. Maybe start changing by apologising to that poor guy."
"Its called existential crisis.
1) Do you perform any physical activity?
2) What do you think about death? What death means to you? What do you think will take place after you die?
3) Are you religious or non-religious person?"
"I’m in the same boat as you. I get these thoughts primarily when I can’t act on them but I’m constantly scared that I’m gonna get them when I can, and I’m a pretty impulsive person so there’s a possibility I could"
"Lol... Will challenge the assumption of gender but not the fact that you aren't a real counselor.

Ohh and I've just seen a comment stating that you're unlicensed. Please, PM me your place of work. I want to make a complaint."
Thank you so much. It means a lot. I’m sorry you’ve been here too. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to actually do it which is good I guess - I guess these are just the thoughts and feelings I’m going over in my head.
"Thank you. I’m trying, although it feels like I’m in a locked room that’s slowly filling with water. I’m scared. 

Right now the campus option is my best bet. I don’t qualify for medicaid since I worked most of 207."
"Thanks for your response, I've been digging a bit for more info on psychopaths and I definitely think it's possible to be on that spectrum. I've been seeing a therapist for about a year but I haven't brought this topic up yet"
Thanks. I think almost every drug changes your brain chemistry in a way. I'm trying my best to quit weed since it is the only addiction I have. I hope that when I quit it I can reverse the effects caused in my brain and body.
"This is probably exactly why they referred you to the face to face. If you're in that bad of a place, they probably wan't you in the hands of a real-live therapist that can read body language and also intervene if necessary. "
"Well now you're just being silly about semantics. I'm not trying to be confrontational, just wanted to offer you some advice because I feel quite strongly about this. I gave you that advice but I'm not here to argue with you."
You're right. You will have difficulties in the future. You'll keep struggling with this until you go see a doctor. There's no shame in getting help. Do yourself a favor and get the help you need. You'll thank yourself later.
"You’re in shock you may not cry for some time and that’s ok. 
It will come in waves and you just need to ride it out. 
It’s ok to not be ok and everything you’re feeling is normal and valid.

"sorry you feel this way.  you should read some of the writings and submissions from people (on their instagram) telling their  stories. if it reaches some people who are struggling with their mental health, i can support it. "
"Don't get to down on yourself. I've found that the bottom line for many health care professionals is money. Despite the illusion that they care about your physical and mental well being, if the check doesn't clear, you're no longer a priority. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't even view it as you being dumped but instead you dumping them as you find a better, more understanding doctor to see. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got your back dude. Message me if I you need to get some stuff off your chest. "
"Ethics aside, it's forcing me to be super healthy. I feel more energetic, or at least the illusion of more energetic. The energy helped me realize that I could feel a whole lot better in the first place.  Even if I can achieve the same on an omnivore diet, it's working well for me at the moment. You're right though, vegans through around some tenuous arguments and I think they undermine the good ones. What can ya do, eh? Cheers for all the advice btw, it's been really helpful."
"I understand the feeling of wanting to seek solitude after being in a social situation. I struggle with too much stimulation. And if I get too much of it, I feel completely miserable. I spend a lot of my time alone and in my bedroom.

I want to help you but the harsh truth is that you need to go see a doctor. Nobody on here can properly diagnose you. Get yourself into therapy and onto prescribed medication. There's no shame in seeking help. You'll feel much better afterwards.
"
"It gets worse.

If you are suicidal because financial burdens are overwhelming you and you can't see a way out, they'll involuntarily hold you until you're no longer suicidal. But now you have EVEN MORE financial problems because of the lack of work and possibly being billed for that involuntary stay.

A psychiatrist pointed out how rediculous that is. When someone is suicidal because of financial issues, don't spend $5k to hold them for a week. Just give them the $5k in cash."
"I have insurance and technically qualify for a sliding scale, but that payment would be $70 when my payment after insurance is $55, which I still can't afford. I totally feel you. 

I would second the idea of looking for an intern. Or if you're a college student by any chance, your school should have therapists that you can see through student health. 

I don't recommend doing the app/text based stuff because from what I've seen, it costs a lot more. 

You can also search around on your insurance's provider list and try to find someone who they pay more towards. 

Your employer might also have an employee assistance program where you can call and they will match you with a therapist. Those are confidential. Or supposed to be.  "
"Aw yeah I've definitely had a moment like that before! Once I responded ""um, okay"" to the ""how are you?"" and then on the customer's way out, he paused and asked, ""so when you said you were okay earlier, why was that? Is everything alright?"" and the genuine concern caught me so off guard that I welled up in tears and had to quickly change the subject and send him on his way out the store so that I could recoup. 

It was refreshing to see that somebody actually cared, because in retail you deal with a lot of people who don't actually see or treat you as a person. 

I hate when you greet them with the ""hello, welcome!"" and a big smile and then they don't even look in your direction, keep walking like you don't exist. I know its the nature of the job, but damn I'm very fragile so I take it to heart! lol

I try to use ""how's your day going?"" instead of ""how are you"" as my go-to social phrase, because it's not so much of a stigma to say ""ehh today's shit"" than it is to say ""I'm shit"" "
"That sounds really hard. Have you spoken to anyone else about this? Or a professional? 

Just a shot in the dark but it might be worth having a look at the symptoms of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD / otherwise known as Borderline Personality Disorder). Note though that there are lots of different types of personality disorder and you don't necessarily have to tick all boxes to experience it. 
If you identify with more of the symptoms it just might shed some light on what you're going through...

You might like to try writing down times when you've felt certain things and trying your best to explain how it feels to you vs what's going on etc. Emotions are very confusing and often come on for no apparent reason, so I'd say the main thing is: don't be scared to feel emotions, whatever they are. 

To add: EUPD symptoms also overlap with a LOT of other mental health issues so I'd recommend simply focusing on what YOU are finding difficult and seeking help for that. "
"Love this question &amp; am 100% spitballing here...

I'm thinking that specific goals are gonna be key.  You've goals in exercise, stands to reason you would have goals in mental fitness.  So, figure out which areas, specifically, you want to improve your fitness in, research how, &amp; then work out how to get there.       

 E.g., let's say I want better emotional management (this is all from my personal life, part of a much larger self-improvement kick I've been on lately).  Specifically, I want to be able to have an emotion without being controlled by that emotion.  Say if someone makes me sad or angry, I don't dwell on it and let it affect my entire day or if I want something (fancy coffee every day), accept that I can live without it.  Research says meditation could be helpful in making these changes.  How I get there is the same as the gym.  Do it regularly &amp; ignore the fact that I'm making no noticeable progress on a daily basis.  Just keep hitting the weights (or the cushion, so to speak).  Also like the gym, I've noticed the changes at random times.  A shirt is way too tight one day and the urge for a coffee pops up, but it goes away a lot easier than in the past.

Step 1, what areas do you want to improve?        "
"Depression is a physical and mental issue. You are correct. Cause if you can't function mentally, you obviously wouldn't be able to function physically....Ask a person in vegetative state....If you have all these medicines that are making you sick, have you told your physician? They will surely adjust your dosage. Get that taken care of ASAP. I remember when I was on Wellbutrin and my mouth would dry up. I already have a speech impediment, but taking that shit made me sound and look like I had rabies....very embarrassing.

​

Your depression can only win if you give up. Take a deep breath and plan out what you want to do each day. Plan out how you will maneuver from one task to the next. Don't be afraid to write things down and remind yourself you have set small goals to conquer the feeling you are currently feeling....which is doing nothing and sitting home all day accomplishing nothing. You may be exhausted sure, but guess what....You'll be more exhausted tomorrow knowing you did absolutely nothing to improve today. Get up. Get out there...Get back to work and take care of yourself. It won't be easy...and you'll have days where you'll doubt yourself...But remember your end goal....which I hope is to find your own level of a happy life...No one can give it to you...you have to find it within yourself, and once found...maintain it with hard work.

"I typically wouldn't give advice like this but you seem to be looking for it so here goes ...

Stop thinking about the big picture so much. There isn't one thing you can do that will fix everything in your life. You have some adversity to deal with, perhaps more than most, but everyone has to fight adversity one way or another. There's no point wasting your life away because of it. You will have to fight and struggle to make your life better but, if you don't start that fight now, then all you're doing is wasting time.

If it helps you, look at other people in much worse situations than yourself who have managed to be successful and happy in life. You may feel that you have been dealt a bad hand in life, but you can overcome it.

I think you should focus your attention on small, achievable tasks. Don't worry about whether it'll turn your life around, just focus on small steps. Find a hobby and set reasonable goals. Commit to it and do a little bit of work on it every day. Eventually you will realise that you have achieved something that you're proud of. This will allow you to keep progressing and to broaden your horizons. Eventually you may find something that you love doing so much that you want to do it for a living and it could become your vocation.

You are the only one who can do this. So get started now and be prepared to fight. You don't have to do much every day - just make sure that every day, you take a step forward towards something positive, whatever it is. The alternative is to be everything you hate about yourself, and you obviously don't want that, otherwise you wouldn't have posted.

Good luck - hope you find something that will give you a happier outlook on life, even if it's just a small improvement to start with."
"So, like i said in the comment before this one, my mood has changed to not as bad. I was angry earlier, but now I’m kind of void of any emotions. It’s still a weird feeling and I’m not right. 

If my mom ever gets her head out of her current bf, I’ll try to talk to her. I think I could do it if my mood changes from bad to angry or empty or something. It would feel easier with my insecurities and fears tucked away a little better than they are when I’m bad. Same with my dad, I’d feel better talking to him when my mood is different. The thing is, when my mood is different I don’t feel like it’s necessary to try and get help or anything. Life kinda sucks ass. 

Everyone I know doesn’t know me, honestly. My teachers so obviously don’t care about how well they’re doing their job or how the kids are doing, they just want to get paid and go home. Even when their job title implies that they should care about the mental and physical well-being of their students, they don’t do it. They just want to get paid and go home. My very few friends are barely my friends. My closest friends would probably just straight up tell me they don’t want to know about my problems and it would be too taboo to bring this up to my not so close friends. My girlfriend is... odd. She’s a sweet girl, so so so extremely smart and very talented in everything she does, and we have a lot of the same tastes like music and humor, but she’s odd still. She’s one of those people who participate and try to be social but they just aren’t good at it. She can barely talk to people and when she does it’s either typical small talk or she’ll bring up some weird topic and scare them off. I went on a tangent there sorrry. Basically, my girlfriend and I don’t have a good enough emotional connection for me to feel comfortable talking to her about this stuff. She broke down and cried on me last night, crying about the future, crying about her mother’s cancer, just crying about all the uncertainty. 

What the fuck is my brain?


Edit- I went off subject completely. I’m using Reddit like a diary and I’m not sure if I should stop or not. It’s momentarily helping. I’m saying things that I’ve never said and try to not think about. I’m sorry."
All these suggestions are awesome but what do you love? I think finding what makes you excited and that you find enjoyment is such a good thing for anxiety. There are so many hobbies that could help in so many different ways.
"I have only two ideas:

You could change your philiosophy to dualism and become religious. Or you can embrace your awareness that our time is limited and use it to make the most of your life and your relationships with others."
"Oh trust me they do. People do respect you more when they think you are in your 20s. I don't even look like teenager anymore and people usually treat me as an adult. Then I have to say to people ""I'm 19"" and it just goes away."
"Okay that really helps- I don't want to put myself in someone's hands if they misinterpret sth I say to mean that I'm a current danger to myself or others.  Bc yeah I'm depressed because of trauma I don't need more, thank you!"
"Possibly depersonalization/derealization. It’s a part of depression that doesn’t always respond to SSRIs. There’s a medication called naltrexone, and a way of using it called low dose naltrexone that can help with dpdr. "
"Totally abusive. I'm so sorry you had to live like that. I'm glad she is out of your life, because you certainly don't need that. I don't know if you've considered counseling, but it might help to speak to someone. Take care. "
"Using language like ""EUPD/BPD sufferer"". For any other illness we'd say ""person living with cancer/ dementia"" but it doesn't translate to mental illness. I might suffer sometimes, but I'm definitely living more than I suffer.
"
"You just keep going. Don't stop... Think but don't stop. Reflect but don't worry, keep going. Run don't walk but keep going. That's the key, to keep going, no matter what you tell yourself or what anyone tells you, keep going."
"different person everyday how ? do you change your personality according to whom you're around ? What kind of person do want to be, and what kind of person do you think you would be if you were the only person left on earth ? "
"&gt; Some of them suck. I mean, really, really suck.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of them are mediocre  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of them are great.

That's true for all the careers, I can see why you say that.

 

&gt;Some of the most important things you can  say are, ""this is working for me"", and ""that is not working for me"" if  you do that reliably, over time, your therapist will know to do more of  the former and less of the latter.

I'm gonna practice that, thank you very much.

"Controlled breathing and/or meditation might be able to help you with the heart rate issue. Also make sure you're getting enough fluids - dehydration can cause increased heart rate, or at least that's what they told me last time I was in the hospital (I always have low blood pressure and a sky-high pulse). 

How not to feel like shit in the morning... might need some more details on this one, sorry! Do you feel like shit mentally or physically or both? Can you be more specific?"
"Hi lovebug777,

Good question.

If you are using psychoactive medications, such as antidepressants, in the manner as prescribed by your doctor, then that would be considered medical use, and would not be reported on in this survey. However, if you are using prescribed psychoactive medication “recreationally,” then you can report that use. For example, if you were prescribed opioid pain medication, but are using them for “non medical purposes” you can report that usage. "
"I feel like I’m at a point of no return, and since I’m not suicidal (tho I do feel worthless at times), I just need to cope and deal with it. Like, this is my life now. Just need to learn to accept it. It ebbs and flows, tho.

I’ve looked at talking to someone, but I get confused with therapist vs psychologist, which is better, then overwhelmed with deciding because I don’t want to pick a wrong one, so I pick none. What helped you decide to call and make an appointment?"
"I’m in a unique situation, one of my parents is in the military and we’re overseas so if I ever say anything like having ongoing thoughts of suicide my other family would be shipped back to the states with me. We would be broke and it would be my fault. So I can’t talk to a professional until I’m back home. (Which’ll take three years) I just want to know if anyone knows what I could have so I could look up how to treat it and maybe make things better in the meantime. "
"My freshman year of college is when I realized I had horrible anxiety and depression. I suggest going to your school’s clinic (most have them I think?) to talk to someone - it really helps a lot! I completely understand the thoughts while being with friends and having fun, but try not to let it keep you from going out. If there’s one thing I regret from college it’s always staying in and never going out because I was so anxious about it at the time. I hope you find help! "
Schizotypal personality disorder is often diagnosed as depression and voices are one the symptoms. Does she have any social quirks that make her feel a bit... odd? Does her social behaviour sometimes make you think of mild Asperger's? That's one of the other possible misdiagnoses for Schizotypal. [https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/schizotypal-personality-disorder#1](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/schizotypal-personality-disorder#1) do any of these symptoms seem familiar?
"Totes where I went. DID is a covert condition, which can include having no consciousness of the parts yourself. Alters in real life are not what they look like on youtube or in movies, which was a huge reason for years why I dismissed my inner voices. 

I'm not going to try and convince you that you have a dissociative disorder, and even if you did have parts, it's common in all the trauma based disorders. Sure sounds like your dissociation is life impacting, though. Therapy?

"
"You are *partially* correct, insofar as I was miserable before meeting you, yes. 

But as with everything else you've said, the rest is absolutely wrong.  You *can* make other people sad, and seeing someone as willfully hateful and willfully ignorant as you hurt other people wherever you go hasn't done anything for my mood.  

So ... congratulations?  Your deliberate actions have made at least one person's shitty life just a little bit worse.  Just like Jesus would have wanted."
"absolutely, that's why I find keeping a journal is very important if you're dealing with mental illness, especially because you can approach the whole thing from a neutral perspective: if you're experiencing a depressive episode you can go back and see that even though some days were terrible, you got through it. Also while you're in it, it's hard to realize that it isn't always all blue, good times exist and you can really value them once you can revive them from your writing."

"Nah dude, it really sounds like bipolar—especially the time lapses with depression and then high energy, the risky behaviors, etc. �� I’m not sure how much it would help, but there’s a memoir I read called Manic by a lady named Terri Cheney that details her struggle with it. It was really eye opening! 

Edit: I have a degree in psychology (not a grad one yet, still working on it), and of course there are people who self diagnose with really silly things and suddenly think they have DID (the amount of YouTube videos—“meet my alters” GAHHHH it burns me up) or something rare like that just because it sounds cool. But I think you should trust your gut in this case and fight for your right to better mental healthcare!"
"Thanks for this and hoping you're right.  The scariest thing for me is the thought that he could get angry at me and snap/want to hurt me.  In general though, he is a quiet, introverted type.  He is more depressed/mopey than angry/explosive.  I am aware that when someone is unstable anything is possible, but I think he is more likely to hurt himself than anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I'm treading lightly - although I am trying to set boundaries, I don't want to upset or anger him.  Right now, my strategy is ignoring him some of the times and telling him I'm busy (which I am) at other times.  Eventually I'll probably talk to him again, listen a bit, and reiterated that I am busy and I don't really have the time to help him. "
"Yeah I understand what you mean. And I get not wanting to ruin or ""shake up"" your friendship with the girl. But you'll also never know for sure what will happen unless you make a move. However, that's a difficult decision to make. Just remember though that if you don't make a move on her, somebody else will probably swoop in and start dating her eventually. And that'll probably hurt quite a bit.

As for your parents, I doubt that you have to worry about scaring them. You just gotta explain it in a way that'll make sense to them. However, that's probably easier said than done. I think you'll be alright if you just tell them the truth. There's nothing wrong with wanting to see a phycologist. But then again, that's just my opinion."
"Yeah I'm working on it both in DBT and with my individual psychologist. We've come to the conclusion it's a mixture of my parents, brother and the bullying I received in school. I was an emotional kid and would always either be hyper or crying. I'd annoy people when hyper and when I cried I'd be made fun of by my brother and sometimes my parents (I have a great family though apart from that). I struggled to find a balance and with all the bullying since year 5, about 2 or 3 years ago I kind of shut off. Really the only time I'm very expressive is when I'm tipsy (I rarely drink though) so I need to try replicate that. I need to learn to have fun again. I'm a bit scared of going over the top and scaring people away so I shut off. "
"Hey there, you cant do that. Right now, you have a family, and thats how it is and your job is to make the best of it so you can raise the happiest, healthiest kids you can. There's absolutely no point beating yourself up about this. You didnt 'do' anything to anyone - you had kids with the best possible intentions and Im sure are trying to raise them in a loving stable environment. Thats all any of us can do. Thats the job of being a parent - todo the best we can with the cards we're dealt. 

What you can offer your kids - that no one else can - is your own life of dealing with mental health issues and all the incredible skills that come with that. None of us go through this thing without getting good at managing all the chaos it can bring. With time, and experience, we learn, and we manage. That means you and your wife have real-life knowledge and skills that you can support your kids with to help them grow and learn and be the best they can be. 

Your kids have issues. That sucks. Its also who they are and you no doubt love them exactly as they are - and thats the important thing. Your job - now - is to give them love and support, and teach them what you can so they can be their best. 

Plenty of kids with 'difficulties' grow into amazing, inspiring adults. Just because your kids have challenges ahead of them doesnt mean they cant be awesome people. In fact, its highly likely that /because/ they have overcome challenges, they /do/ become awesome people. You and your wife should know this - this shit that we experience - mental illness - if nothing else, builds character. Ask around - a lot of the truly inspiring people in the world attribute their qualities to hardships they overcame. 

Every moment you spend feeling bad about yourself for something you have absolutely no control over now is disempowering for you as a parent and will contribute to despair against the problem. Dont do that. Theres no point. You gain nothing. Your kids get nothing from that either. Instead of doing that, make the decision to focus your energy on what you can do for your kids now, going forward, every day, to give them the best possible lives they can have. 

Remember, of all the people on the planet, you are the best possible person to be a dad to your kids. There's no one else as equipped or able to do that job for them. And for their sake, take pride in that, and commit to doing what you can, not feeling bad about or trying to change things that are now in the past. 

Said with love. 

All the best."
"So cost is something that's going to vary between therapists. Many therapists have a sliding scale payment system that allows them to charge patients based on their income, so always ask if that is an option.

I'm assuming you're in the United States, but if you're not I'm not sure how much this information is going to overlap with your healthcare.

But if you have medical insurance, mental health treatment should be covered. Check your policy to make sure. If you don't have insurance, that sliding scale payment is going to be your best friend. Most therapists will be open to working with you to find a cost that is fair but affordable.

If you live in an area with a university or a hospital, look for psychiatric teaching clinics. Grad students in psychology have to complete a certain number of clinical hours to get their doctorates, and you can be treated by them during that time for very little cost, even without insurance. Teaching clinics should have information about these programs on their websites. Graduate students are on the cutting edge of psychological theory (which could be either good or bad, depending), and more importantly, they're completely invested in your recovery and well-being. You're one of their first patients, and they want to do well and they want to help you! Additionally, they have supervision, so you know for a fact they keep to ethical standards (the supervision keeps to strict confidentiality guidelines. As with any therapy or counseling, your information and the content of your visits are protected).

Younger therapists right out of school will almost always charge you less, and they'll be more up to date on the most current psychological treatments. Unless you're really uncomfortable with the lack of experience and age, I'd keep my eyes open for younger therapists.

Sometimes, counselors will have cheaper rates, and they often do similar or the same services as psychologists. I saw one for awhile during a crisis, and it was exceedingly affordable.

How often you want to meet is based on your personal needs and your therapists availability. I've done every other week and weekly therapy, and both have helped. Monthly is a large gap, but totally workable. Monthly meetings is likely what you would get if you started seeing a psychiatrist (unlike a psychologist they can prescribe medication. it's rare to receive therapy from a psychiatrist.)

A good place to look for a psychologist is PsychologyToday.com. They have a database on mental health providers in your area, and you can search by their specialties, what insurance they take, etc. it's a great tool to see what's out there. They also have estimates for the cost of appointments.

Group therapy is also an option, and can be somewhat cheaper. There are often free therapy groups run by the community. I'd look into the National Alliance on Mental Illness and see if they do anything in your area. They can definitely give you more mental health resources, even if you're not a fan of group meetings. Public libraries sometimes also host peer support or local therapy resources, so check there for free mental health resources in your community as well.

Again, sorry for the long post, but I'm trying to throw in any resources I can think of that might be of help to you."

This made my morning. Having a rough one so far...not feeling very happy. Also...the urges are back. I have to fight them with all my might right now. Thank you though! :)"
From my own experience as a client receiving mental health treatment my experience hasn’t been like what you described in your question...so if you have examples to educate me on what you’re talking about that’d be great
Go talk to someone because as you said lots of people struggle with what you struggle with. I remember the youtuber Dodie talked about it in her youtube video here https://youtu.be/YfOHh5mt9SM. I wish you the best of luck❤️
Have you tried contacting you state's Department of Social and Health Services? In other places it may just be the Department of Social Services. But they often have housing resources in my state that could be helpful for you.
I am 47 and I would like more people my age to relate to and who can relate to me. I have little in common with a 25 year old. I agree mental illness doesn't discriminate but it is nice to have another little space of our own.
"I know what that is all about. I give more of a fuck now because I can recognize better when I am feeling wonky. I hope you don't mind, but I would like to share my story with you, if you would like to hear a good tale of woe. "
Im not an expert about giving advice but for me i think you should be on her side all the time. Dont let her watch any movies or news for a week. It may affect her a lot if she saw a news/movie that is related in that accident.
Interesting! It seems people are either for it or completely against it. If you have a paranoid type of disorder I completely get it it seems like the reaction would be very negative. However most things I feel weed does help.
"Is there anything to suggest he might be actively psychotic right now? I've definitely isolated myself socially during episodes. 

That said, it could well be that he just doesn't want to talk to you. There's no way of knowing."
"Ok. Again I would recommend looking into CBT therapy, as I think it would really help you. I am dealing with Depression, Anxiety, and OCD and I am just starting CBT (my first session was today). 

I wish you well!

"Self-deprecating humor aside, it has less to do with what other think about me because I either need them and love them forever, or fuck 'em because why not and it can shift rapidly and everything to do with what I think of me."
"That's true. I don't think I saw your post on r/schizophrenia (which is mainly where I post) but I would agree with your assessment. I do think that APs taking it away makes for a good case that it's psychosis-related, though. "
"That’s great advice, thank you. I’ll keep practising for a while longer and hopefully I’ll start to benefit from it. I guess I expected it to work quicker and I just need to invest a little more time in it, to be honest. "
"This IS just awful advise. The key here is to do it EXACTLY how he does ������ trying to one up him is only going to show that you are vindictive and you’re going to play yourself

"Today is my 4th day of taking it. I’m on 10mg, I had been on 200mg Zoloft but that wasn’t working for me so my dr is having me try this. So far I haven’t noticed any difference except nausea when I take it without eating."
"Yea my mom was the same way she cried when I got my diagnosis. You have to stand up and tell her you need space, but your parents should know they’re your biggest supporters and will always be there for you. Same with family."
"Yoga is always good to try! Idk what gym you’re a part of or what your membership includes, but some gyms include free classes with their memberships so I say if it’s no charge to take or try a class, might as well try it! "
"A therapist can't help you if you're unwilling to communicate.  Sometimes in therapy, the patient is just not ready to engage therefore it leads to them saying they are fine and ultimately nothing gets resolved.  Your therapist is not a mind reader... You have to do your part to help yourself. Try writing things down prior to session and giving it to your therapist....that might be helpful to start a conversation and hopefully you can open up and make some progress.  Good luck! "
"Don't let that bring you down. You never know, they might be wrong, but even if you do, it's nothing to be ashamed of. You can choose to let it define you or you can choose to be just a person with borderline personality disorder. You are not your disorder. And I'm sure your personality is fine, and people will just have to get used to who you are. Keep your chin up. Stay strong and just keep doing you. Follow the medication or therapy that was recommended, but don't be ashamed."
"I don't think I do... At least, not a whole lot, if so. I've heard disembodied voices that never make sense, and I've felt pressure occasionally like someone's touched me, and I sometimes see a ball of light? But it just sounds like ghosts to me so it clashes with my spiritual beliefs and I just never know what to think &gt;\_&lt; but I have a therapist I'm working on it with! And I'm more inclined to believe concrete evidence, rather than religious stuff.

Thank you for asking!"
"I have had experience with all 3 (in the US), some in multiple settings. Overall most (but not all) of my experiences were positive. I don’t want to overwhelm you with details if that’s not what you’re looking for, but if you have specific questions I’d be more than happy to answer.

"This article is really helpful:
https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-living/sex-life/a2248/how-to-get-over-being-dumped/

I would recommend you to get some help for your depression and anxiety from a therapist or psychiatrist. I had the same situation with my ex where I couldn't see happiness if it wasn't with him. It took me a long time to learn that I needed to love myself and get help.

I wish you the best of luck, remember you have other people in your life reach out to them."
"When I get anxiety really badly I start to stutter a lot. That leads me to believe that there's likely a way a medication could be used to cure some cases. In fact I'd be surprised if SSRIs and benzos don't improve some people's stuttering. 

actually https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttering#Medications

it says there that studies have been carried out but most didn't stand up to peer review. In the only valid study it appears those medications and a few others do in fact help. "
"Thanks for posting this. I read it, and resonated with “Mariela” a lot. It’s really tough sometimes to give yourself a break. Especially since your conscious is with you every step of the way, so you’re left stewing over microcosms that led you to your current state of depravity.

With that being said, it was once recommended to me that if my head is full of negative thoughts that I was telling myself, to imagine saying them to your best friend (little brother, grandma, whatever). Seems silly, right? You would never criticize someone you loved as harshly as to yourself. But that’s EXACTLY it. You have to love yourself before you have love to give. So treat yourself with the same respect as you would your best friend :) "
"When I was 19, I started cutting myself. It was to relieve the mental pain I felt from life. I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts..even to this day.. anyway, I had had enough of life at the age of 19 and decided I wanted to end it all. I thought of my mother though,  I thought of how she would find me and never forgive herself. I called a crisis center and got help. I still struggle with the urge to hurt myself but I have ways to calm myself down.. I was in a low place.. I got into my first marriage and had a baby, which caused me to gain weight.  My ex divorced me because I was too fat for him. It caused me to get severely depressed, I cried all day every day for a while. About 6 months after my divorce, I started talking to a guy online. We met, eventually got married and I have a set of twins with him. I've been married for 8 years now, happily. Life can pull you through rough patches. If you need anyone to talk to, message me on here, or I have Facebook too! "
"It's ok to not be the perfect kid your parents want you to be. You have to be the perfect kid you want yourself to be. I am going through a similar phase in my life where I don't follow my parents' religion and face a lot of heat for it. My parents give me emotional as well as ""religious"" doses on a daily basis. What I did do is, just like you, to keep them happy I tried getting along with it for couple of days. But when you keep your mind open and consciousness active, your time in a church or religious place becomes a live torture and you feel annoyed looking/listening to half the things around.

And I don't think I can take it, it really takes a toll and gives you all the vibes for a bad day ahead. I have just started adjusting to it and have started ignoring quite a bit of their expectations of me. If you become the perfect kid your parents want you to be, you'll never become what your mind wants you to be and you'll always stay lost, somewhere in between. And then once you start becoming that model child, life becomes a puppet and the definition of ideal keeps having a lot more constraints added to it, time and again. 
It's not a bad thing you are doing, just might be a disappointment for others for a while. Just live with it."
"Thankyou for you kind words, and yes! These episodes can be extremely intense. It is a very unusual thing, that complete lack of a sense of how much time has passed, because it literally feels like forever in some horribly direct sense. And it can take a while to get your head round only a few minutes having gone by.

I also have vivid memories of crying at my mum that she was shouting/being loud or otherwise sounding like she was really frightened. 

It is indeed an incredibly weird experience, and I'm only glad that I've been able to discover the name of this beast, so to speak, and to find others that have gone through the same sort of set of symptoms. There's something very healing in that, because up until very recently, I thought this only happened to me.

It's been especially healing in being able to quantify all the aspects of it properly through the medical literature and accounts of other's experiences and developing a proper set of conceptual tools to begin unpacking those extremely disorientating experiences.

I'm glad you've been able to relate to my depiction. For me it's very much been like finding a really important piece to a puzzle of a really confusing part of my life experience. So it's all a healing process. :)"

"Check into getting on some meds.  See a psychiatrist. They'll do an evaluation. Then give a recommendation on a med to try.  You can ask about any concerns.  You can also choose to not take the meds recommended. It's your choice.  But basically, it's worth seeing a psychiatrist.

Google ""unipolar"" and ""dystymia"" and that might give you some insight.  You might also be interested in taking the MBTI personality test to get some insight as to who you are and some of your tendencies."
"Existentialism says that there is no inherent meaning outside of yourself.  You give meaning and a sense of importance to things.  There is nothing outside of that.  Its just you.

Nihilism basically says have a laff, its all bullshit.  There are seven billion people on earth and we are all going to die.  Nothing you can do about it.

 There are no Gods, Nirvanas or rewards; this is it.  There is some relief, if this is true which I am NOT saying it is true.  Nobody really knows."
"Hi. I'll be honest, I'm struggling a little to understand exactly what you're looking for here. It seems like this person needs to see a professional who might be able to give a diagnosis and hopefully a treatment plan.

I get the feeling from your post (correct me if I'm wrong) that this isn't possible for some reason.

Just trying to understand why you're looking to research this yourself rather than refer him to a professional, as that sounds like the best option in this case."
I feel it's not nearly severe enough to warrant medication. Basically I'm just looking for psychological help but I cant really get a psychologist. Im totally able to function just gets annoying at times. I could be wrong but I feel like I feed my problem if I make it out to be a bigger deal than it really is. Like I shouldnt be thinking that I need to accept it and build my life around it. I'm thinking more like realizing it's just an issue with my thinking that can be changed.
"It’s hard. It’s so hard. I told my therapist that sometimes it feels like my emotional energy is like cake frosting and everyone and everything in my life is a layer of the cake of my life. Not everyone gets frosting all the time, I just simply don’t have enough. 

Your feelings are valid. Not enough people in your life tell you that you’re doing great or that you’re enough. I’m here telling you that you are enough and that you’re doing enough. Be kind to yourself. "
"Mental health isn't your fault, but aspects of your lifestyle, that are within your control, can play a role in it. 

I have the tendency to get depressed, but I combat it with productivity, nutrition, and exercise. On days where I sleep in until 11:30 am, and fail to get work done, it's a lot easier for me to slip into a depressed mindset. 

TLDR; it's not your fault, but wallowing in self-pity and refusing to act on it, the consequences of which make it worse, ARE your fault. 
"
"I should clarify - by diet, I mean I am controlling portions, and have macronutrient goals balanced for my weight.  I am eating to lose weight, but foremost to maintain bodily health.  That's the idea, anyway; I kinda fell off the train in the past 2 weeks.  The issue does kind of seem to run in the family, though, so something genetic would make sense.

Do you have any more info on why that list of nutrients in particular is important?  I'm sure I could just google it, but I'd rather have an educated response if possible.

Re: masturbation, drugs, alcohol: curiously, is this something to do with dampening your response to dopamine?  Would something like a learned addiction to social media, shopping, etc. be similarly problematic?"
"I’ve done all of these things. Maybe I am getting bad information? But I’ve contacted the crisis centers. I waited SEVEN MONTHS.. to get a free trauma center to help me. But they haven’t been helpful actually and it honestly seems like they don’t know what they’re doing.

My parents have no money either so they can’t help out. My mother is in denial that things are wrong with me. 

The problem is that everything takes **so long** to set up. I’ve been waiting for so long to get these appointments and I’ve been trying to set something up with sliding-scale but so far no luck. And I don’t know why. Things are really confusing right now and I am having trouble making sense of normal every day things I usually can do."
"Perhaps it’s the way you are phrasing it to your mom? To make any progress in therapy, there has to be some kind of chemistry between therapist and client. You need to “click.” A good therapist can make that happen with most clients, but just as in the rest of your life, not all relationships work out. 

Maybe instead of telling your mom you want to quit, try explaining that you don’t feel compatible with this particular therapist and ask if you could try someone new. You can tell her that this therapist doesn’t seem to be listening to you and you don’t feel like it’s a good use of your time or your moms money - but be sure to emphasize that you are still open to therapy with someone else (I’m assuming you are?). 
"
"Honestly it was my boyfriend who induced the decline of sex. He claimed to just not want it as much as I did and I was rejected pretty often. It has destroyed whatever self esteem id rebuilt in the years. Finding that he'd been masturbating to porn while declining me for sex really made me feel bad inside. But, we have been scheduling sex to help improve that. 

Basically what I mean by the damage is done is that the constant rejection and feeling of being unwanted physically just brought me down so many levels. I stopped believing him when he called me pretty, got desperate, etc. 


It was quite inhumane. Although I try to explain to my boyfriend and on here what happened, I don't think I will ever be able. I don't think I could find someone more manipulative or corrupt if i spent my whole life searching. I was able to close the door on that relationship after many times of cheating and the fact the relationship had become LD helped me to move on but I never fully healed from it. "
"I would look up attachment theory and the bio social model. I had these major insecurities and always had (diagnosed) generalized anxiety disorder, diagnosed when I was 6 or 7. When I was 16, they normally don’t diagnose this but I was diagnosed with BPD traits and later BPD. I got Dialectical Behavioural Therapy and the right meds and also got diagnosed and put on a medication for ADHD and my life turned around. Almost all symptoms are in remission and I don’t act on urges anymore and almost never act on harmful behaviours to myself. I’ve changed a lot as a person and although when I’m anxious or maybe need medication adjustments or there’s a lot of things going on in my life I do need reassurance and validation, I can use wise mind (look this up) and understand it’s unlikely that this fear is true, and it’s okay to ask the person (non manipulatively) for reassurance and validation that everything is ok.

These things helped majorly with my anxiety and other issues. "
"I've tried. I go to counseling, I do groups, I read DBT books. I speak with ""I feel"" statements. I admit my faults. Yet it always ends with me ripping my own hair out while sobbing on the floor with him literally pointing his finger at me and screaming all of my faults at me.

He refuses to go to counseling. He refuses to move out (even though he'd actually be able to stay closer to his work). He broke the promises he made while I was in the hospital. 

Look, it's a lot more complicated than that. He doesn't want to listen to me, that's the problem. He refuses to listen, he takes his anger out on me, and then he gets even angrier when I say that's not ok. Every time I try to speak softly, or kindly about sensitive subjects, he immediately goes on the defensive and won't hear me. He just pushes his assumptions on me as fact. This refusal to hear me and refusal to let me go cultivated my suicidal thoughts because I feel trapped by someone who is supposed to love me but won't anymore."
"If you and your therapist have a good rapport, and you think it’s possible she COULD meet your needs but isn’t, it might be worthwhile to talk to her about it. Tell her what your goals are in therapy. Ask her if she can help you get there. If she says yes, ask her specifically how/with what techniques. She may be letting you direct the sessions, without really knowing what you want. (If she says no, or you know you don’t want to continue with her no matter what, you should still bring up these things at your first session with a new therapist. Goal setting and knowing what techniques they use are so important.)

Therapists are professionals, and people stop seeing them for any number of reasons. It’s okay to simply not schedule a follow-up. If you feel like you need to say something, just politely say thank you for what she’s done, but that you won’t be returning. Personally, when I have changed therapists I have always just not scheduled a follow up visit. 

Good luck!"
"My SO had difficulty dealing with how I acted when I was in a bad place in the beginning of our relationship. The easiest thing for me to do that I found helped was to 1)cry. It's always okay to cry, to remember that bad days happen to everyone, but dont let yourself fall so far as to believe everything has to end. And 2) remember the little things he says or does that make you feel good, or loved. Either the way he holds you, or the way he looks at you, something happy. I know that I always wanted to keep the bad thoughts going. I let them control me. You control your own mind. It's incredibly difficult to take the control back but breathing helps immensely and thinking of the love you have and see yourself taking back your mind as you would see fighting for your relationship. I spoke these things out loud very often. Repetitively like a mantra. And I'm in a much better place now. Not perfect, not always happy, but better and that's what I needed to give back to my relationship. 
"
"Those tests aren't usually accurate but if you were at all thinking you might actually have ASD just go to the doctors. If you're male then the diagnostic process is fairly simple, usually some questionnaires and talking with your doctor and stuff. If you're female then it probably won't be so simple as it presents differently in men and women and so a lot of women get told they don't have it even when they do because most of the diagnostic testing is based around male asd representation. I got told I didn't have it 3 times before I had a full cognitive evaluation for different reasons and according to that I have the exact profile of a woman with asd so I was then diagnosed but anything relating to autism and aspergers in women is ""more complicated"" (a term lovingly used by an idiot psychiatrist I once saw, during the same meeting he also told me I have no mental health problems - cut to half a year later when my new team is working out which inpatient facility to send me to lol)."
"The best way to find a good therapist is through word of mouth and reviews. If there's some kind of mental health community in the area where you live, it'll be good to approach them and see if they have resources to figure out who good therapists are. I found my therapist through word of mouth, and many others do so as well or purely through trial and error. You can browse through clinic websites online and check the profiles of therapists in your area too, see what kind of issues and therapy methods the therapists specialise in and narrow down your choices from there.

I'm not sure what you mean by therapists coming from the Bible belt, because therapists should not bring their own personal religious beliefs into sessions with their patients. If you find your therapist bringing religion into therapy sessions, do let them know that it's very unprofessional and I'd recommend you find a different one.

A good therapist should also be able to guide the direction of a therapy session, if you are unable to figure out which direction you want it to go in. But they shouldn't be dragging you along and forcing you to do things you are uncomfortable with. A proper therapist knows how to lead and ask the right questions to help their patient."
"Life can be so exhausting. There sounds like you experience a lot of resistance within yourself. If you can't let go of people or specific events, then thats just how you experience things, don't guilt yourself about this and feel bad that this isn't what ""reasonable people"" do.  It's difficult to enjoy people's company and make new friends, when theres so much self doubt and confusion, stress etc. It's okay to feel directionless, it's okay that things are dull, those aren't positive things, but they're just what you are feeling, so let yourself feel that without resisting it so hard. I used to have very bad anxiety, and I resisted so hard, i was pissed i couldn't control myself, that I felt so out of control with my body and mind. I'm still learning how to ""let it go and let it be"" rather than try to fight it. I heard this quote that stuck with me ""What you resist persists, what you embrace dissolves"". My anxiety has improved over the years, it's taken a lot of effort to let go of the resistance or the thoughts ""I shouldnt be feeling this way"". This is the way you feel, for whatever reason, embrace the discomfort and uneasiness, it will pass. And your comment regarding therapy, why would you not be honest with them, and feel the need to lie and put on a happy face?  Are you worried about judgement? If you plan to go to therapy, on your own will, then you must to a certain extent be aware that you want help. If you know you need help, why won't you receive it openly and honestly?  If you meet a compatible therapist, it will take some time, but you will soon feel safe disclosing personal things. Therapy is great! The biggest investment you could make is towards your mental health and well being. Good luck, and hope you reach out soon! "
"Then don't be strong. Stop being strong. Go weak. Let everything come over you. It's there anyways. What else can you do?

There's shit inside. Face it. Stop running away from it, stop trying to fight it, stop trying to conquer it. Face it. Let it go through you, because if you're in hell, the only way to get out of it is to go through it. There is no return back to the peace and happiness you felt as a child. When I say there's no ""return"", I literally mean that you can't reverse the direction and go back to that same place. But even though there may not be a ""return"", there is a way to reclaim it. 

The current is pushing you forward, and you're trying to go back to the spring from which the current originated from. It's impossible. The current may be pushing you into the fires of hell, or ""the desert"" as they call it in mysticism. But the desert is not the end. Obviously you're trying with everything you have to return from the peaceful spring from which it originated if you think the desert is the end and this is where you will face your demise, but it is not. Keep going, keep moving ahead and don't look back, and one day you will meet the ocean and become endless. That is my promise to you.

When going through hell don't stop. The fear is that if you keep going you will only keep encountering the more deeper and darker realms of hell, and that's why you want to return. But I promise you, the hell is not endless, and if you keep facing —not running away from— this inner hell in you, one day you will reach the end of its territory. You don't have a choice anyways. You know just as well as I do that there's no turning back. But the whole world tries to do exactly that and that's why the world is in so much suffering. It's trying to do the impossible. And in fact, I dare to proclaim that there is more human suffering from trying to do the impossible, to return, to reverse the direction, than from hell itself. 

So remember. There's only a going through. But there's no turning back"
"""Normal""? Hell no.

""Able to function like a person without the need to start damn fires several times a day""? HELL YES.

I can't stop on my own, though...and I am not 100% sure I want to stop altogether. It is so confusing.

"I can't diagnose you, but it really sounds like dermatillomania. I also have a mania, so I am right there with you. :) You can go look it up and then decide if you would like to talk to a professional for it. Good luck to you. :)"
I see. Thank you for your response! I didn't mean to use the term too light-heartedly but I just couldn't explain why I kept having those nightmares. PTSD goes deeper than its literal meaning it seems. Thank you for educating me!
"I think its normal but maybe its not normal to be so aware of it, like usually people wouldn't aknowledge it... I'm not sure though as its all subjective. Have you read Allan Watt's book on the tabboo against knowing who you are?"
"I understand it's tough but your choices are A) face it head on and get help or 2) carry on as you are.

I'm not sure if you're in the UK or not but here you don't have to declare any mental health problems if you don't want to. "
"I'm currently doing cbt + meds. Still can't go where I want and do the things I used to, but I'm improving. I can go to work and the store and things in my bubble. And my bubble is slowly expanding. It takes time. Can't rush it. "
"If you had mania you wouldn't be here. To be hypomania it Should last 4 days it brings high energy, no sleep, you make stupid decisions, you can barely think straight. If it last more than 4 days and it gets worse go to a doctor "
My mom had to remove and hide all the guns. My dad just tried to commit suicide last night. He voluntarily went to the hospital and was commited and now he can’t leave. Can you call your hospital or police no emergency hotline?
See this is what I'm afraid of. I always thought that I have rejection sensitivity related to ADHD but I think something else might be going on thats making me cling on to people and be so needy. :( Psych appointment here I come!
"Send them a message.

Often we worry about the act of caring, and we end up not caring in the end. Send them a message and if they don't reply, that's okay. Show them that you still care about them and you want to stay connected."
"Sounds like a form of dissociation. I would personally seek diagnosis and or therapy, but look into dissociation and grounding techniques + mindfulness skills (wise mind, observe, describe, participate - look up DBT mindfulness) "
"Thanks! It was just a general personality test, not a diagnostic test, but the moment I saw I was neurotic, disagreeable, and not very conscientious it made me think about my choices! I might set some goals and make some changes."
"Thanks. It's distressing for sure. I can't even say the NAME of it without having a panic attack (almost)...

Thank you again. :( Wish there were someone else here with the same problem so I can talk to them...:( I feel so alone."
"Think about it as if it is just one more day to go through, tomorrow will get better, you just need to go through today. That thought always stops me from doing something bad. If you need to talk I’m right here, I’ll listen. "

Are you in China? If so you have a right to complain. 

If not, start working on yourself and start asking girls out. "

"You know, that actually helps a lot to read. It's nice to know that there are people like me out there. Of course I know there are, but hearing it first hand is kinda more real if that makes sense.

You're not a bad person. There are some posts here that I can't answer because they either trigger me terribly or I have no advice since (at that moment) I am feeling like I can't give good advice because I would be a hypocrite.
"psilocybin microdosing. thats a huge one that is supposed to help a lot. also cbd if weed doesnt seem to help. im sorry that stuff hasnt worked out for you, i hope you find some relief soon man. ill be praying for you, good luck!"
"thank you for sharing your story &lt;3. I don't know if I'll be able to tell them exactly what I have, but I'm going to try. Since I'm way closer to my grandmother than I am to my parents, I think I'm going to talk to her first. "
"Definitely seek out someone to speak to. Whether it be a professional or friend. Talk. First part is acknowledging and then expressing. Youve already started that, which is awesome. Know that youre not some abnormality. A lot of us are going through our own issues. Myself included. Sharing about those feelings and knowing that they are just that, feelings. You are not your thoughts. Try to take some of the pressure off of yourself and allow yourself some time. Stay strong friend. "
"I struggle with this and when I have to ask for help in public it sucks because I feel stupid and like the person feels like I am stupid for asking them to explain what they said like 3 times before I can grasp anything.

I think this an adhd thing but I'm not sure. It seems like an 'executive function' dysfunction type deal. Like I hear what they are saying and can retain it most times but I just dont 'get it' until a key word just clicks. I dunno it's hard to try to explain lol."
"I think there's a lot of overlap between depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia/psychosis. I definitely experience this as well and haven't noticed any improvement in this area with either my antipsychotic (Invega) or my antidepressant (Wellbutrin). 

I wish I could give you some things that help, but I haven't found anything yet. I just try to latch onto anything that brings me any pleasure or joy, which is practically nothing these days. 

Keep on keeping on, I guess."
It’s bad enough to be having a hard week and then in comes your idiotic boss spouting off his opinions. I’m not sure what I would have done in that situation to be honest. I’m really sorry you experienced that and all that you go through. That 60-something baby boomer generation seems to be really lacking mental health awareness and understanding. I have a family member who told me to “just be positive” when I tried to explain my PTSD and anxiety to her. I just can’t.
"You shouldn't think about how you could have changed what happened because you cannot change the past anymore. And no imo you have done nothing wrong. Having sex and wanting to have sex is human nature. Those guys are in the wrong here. If I am to speak emotionally, I would fuck them up for you if I was your friend cos I get really angry over stuff like this. But don't let assholes define you. You are beautiful and there are a lot of guys out there that would definitely think so. "
"The Zevia will definitely help me. I know for sure I can cut out soda completely if I switch to carbonated water. Eggs are definitely a great idea for me, a couple of boiled ones will fill me up. Cheese is my weakness, so glad to know I can do a steak, hard-boiled eggs, and some greens for lunch. I could live off fast-food. 

Man that's awesome to know how your energy increased. My need for sleep is insatiable! I could sleep for 12 hours straight and wake up tired. I frequently nap on my lunch, because I'm up at weird (re: fluctuating) hours. 

I'll definitely Google Keto. Thank you for giving me an idea how life could change with my diet. I hear that exercise and diet will make positive changes, but it seems like I really don't know *how* life would change. 

Do you know how long it'll take to experience the change? I know by going back on my meds, it's not an overnight thing, it's gonna take a couple of weeks to see a difference. Is it the same thing with diet?

Thanks again mate."
"Hi Tyler. I understand exactly how you are feeling and wanted to message you that you aren't alone buddy. I too have up and down periods and have experienced this my entire life. I don't know you, and I can only speak for myself when I say, this will probably never go away. I realize i'm just not as happy as everyone around me. And even some of those people aren't really as happy as they put on. What you have to do is figure out what it is in life you want and just go for it. Stop caring about the outcome and just throw yourself to the wolves and don't look back. The issues you are facing probably stem from childhood and it is effecting your life right now cause you want more than you can currently receive. And due to the fact that you can't have all what your heart desires RIGHT NOW, you feel you can't ever be happy. It's true...You probably won't ever truly be happy, but you can surely put in the effort to be AS HAPPY as YOU can possibly be. If you're depressed, think about something that you can fix NOW and slowly chip away at that wall of sorrow. Trust me, the more you wait, the bigger the wall gets and the harder it is to bring down. I am recovering from long term depression myself, and it still effects me today. I just started to do things to say ""Fuk it"" and ""I don't care anymore""...Let me be me and show people who I really am.... Good Luck bro.

"Imagine what it would be like to be one of those people who doesn't have depression?! To have those days where normal-every-day things aren't a total struggle. God, it's maddening sometimes!!! 

This might be some help or not, but what I do so I feel like I can breathe is to 
1. Have a bedtime routine to relax (I like to escape and read a book or spend time with my partner before sleeping and have a shower/brush teeth and what not). As long as I get more that 6 hours I don't fuss over what time I sleep. 
2. And the other thing is getting out of bed the same time in the mornings (I do miracle morning too). 
3. Keeping the spaces I use de-cluttered &amp; clean. 

I know these are all just more habits and kinda sound like a drag. But these aren't really about being ""better"" or ""changing"", it's about bringing back structure and stability into your life where &amp; when you can. The modern world tricks us into thinking we don't need to, grrrr. But it's the same with kids, they need structure which I think is ideally what caregivers provide - like, we know that kids thrive when they have a regular bed time. Doing all of these things have helped me a lot personally (so it would be a guess to say they'd help you or even that you don't do these things already). But doing them has lead to my 7 years of depression totally subsiding except for when my anxiety feels crippling. Sorry if you didn't want this kind of advice on this post, but if you're open to it maybe this will help you out a bit. 

"
"Numb and paralysed by anxiety is horrible! And yes, being kind to yourself is a very important thing. People with anxiety and depression tend to be cruel to themselves emotionally.
Yes, I agree, it's a slow process. I look back at the past 8 years of my life and think I should've gotten a lot further in life than I am, but at the same time I'm so happy I'm not where I was 8 years ago or even 2 years ago. I'm so happy I've gotten somewhere. I still have every intention of moving forward even though I'm too slow in my own mind and I compare myself to others who are so successful at the age of 20 and I feel I should be in that same place, but we all have different roads and we come from different places. Some people are luckier than others and I just still feel motivated to move forward, because there's still so much time left and it's only too late when we're dead to do the things we want to do. Also, maybe the more stuff we do, the more active we get. I feel this is true because the healthier and happier we get, the more productive we get so there's a good reason to be motivated to get better (mentally) as well.
When I've been out running (as I was today) I do feel distinctly better in my mind and I feel better about life as a whole. It didn't come right away when I first started running, but I've been running for about 9 years now and consistency is key! I love feeling the endorphins after a run. And feeling my mood lift as well. It's better than the medication I've been on for years."
"When I've had a really bad day and I just want to give up, I decide that that day is done, and I finish off anything necessary for that day, then I get myself comfortable and snuggly in bed with either a good book, my phone or tablet to browse Reddit or Instagram, then when it's bedtime, I sleep. Tomorrow is a fresh start.

I don't know your past, but I've been in the situation where I thought I had no future, many times. I had to pick up the pieces and try again. I started again so many times. I'm finally in a good place after so many years, and a past that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Please don't give up hope. Perhaps right now you don't see a future, but things can change.

Is there anything you can do to make your days more worthwhile? A hobby, a part time job, volunteering, spending time with someone, having a penpal, reading a book? I just downloaded an app to listen to podcasts while I knit and I listen and they make me stop over thinking and obsessing and going down paranoid depths.

I didn't think I would find a future. I tried so many things that didn't work out, for so many reasons. What sort of future would you like? How can you attain that? It might be a long, slow process. It's taken me 8 years to get to my current state, and I'm just an entry level job, but in the industry I've always wanted to work in. I kept working at it slowly. There were plenty of setbacks because of my health. But don't let things like that stop you. You're a strong person, you can do this."
"I have BPD and I was treated at my university clinic by a really great counselor. Your gf's tuition might include the cost of the clinic so she may not have to pay extra for sessions. 
Keep gently encouraging her to see someone, if you have a mutual friend who has had counselling, get them together to talk about the experience and the benefits. 
The benefits for me have been tremendous. I realized that so much of my every day existence was possessed by fear and envy, and how destructive those overwhelming emotions were. It has taken me a very long time to accept certain truths about myself and being Borderline; but I would never trade my life for what it was before - I was not a person, I was a walking fire alarm. It's hard to explain but she might understand the feeling. To live in the absence of such fear now is an indescribable relief. It was worth it to go through therapy, as hard as it is sometimes; my only regret is that I wish I had started sooner. 
A lot of people have a negative view of therapists due to a past experience with a counselor-figure (I did, anyway). It is important to know that the first counselor she sees may not be perfect for her, if she doesnt feel a connection it is okay to find someone else. It is not a reason to give up! Some cities have clinics for women's mental health care; all she would need is her AGI from
 her yearly tax form and ID to sign up for a program like this.
I will also say this, it is rough being the partner in this situation, you might consider talking to your own counselor as well - it helps to talk with a third party as issues come up, you are going to need support. It's okay to ask for help - but do not go to anyone in her family, as that could backfire tremendously.

Edits: for clarity"
"My psychiatrist and I share the same birthday. Same. Exact. Birthday. Month, day, year.

It instantly reminded me of an article The Last Psychiatrist wrote (great blog, I recommend reading all his posts) about a patient of his that was the same age. The patient was really insecure about it, because the difference of what they have done so far in their lives was so different. I think the patient started trying to be just like him, and other times make himself better.

So when my psychiatrist said we shared the same birthday that article went through my mind. There's no way I could have gotten through medical school with all my mental health issues. I was struggling with my career, and now have lost my career. And look at him: married with twins with a nice 9-5 job.

Yeah, the thought kinda sucked. But then I realized it wasn't that different than anyone else around my age. We all have our different lives, and that's OK. This is the life I have and I'll try to make the best of it. Now I often forget we share a birthday, let alone the same age. It just isn't important to our relationship.

In the end, though, it all comes down to how *you* feel about it. Accept it exists and explore the feeling. See how it makes you feel, and effects your productivity. 

It's possible that exploring your feelings about this will open up areas of your psyche that will benefit your mental health progress.

It's possible it's such a nagging itch that it hampers your mental health progress.

I recommend talking to your therapist about it. Take some time and explore how you feel, and then make a decision of whether to go or stay.

It's OK to go if you think leaving is best.

It's OK to change your mind later and leave if it bothers you more than you predicted."
"All the time. I always imagine being back in high school, still knowing everything I know now. All the different choices I would make from then to now (I'm 29) I could be so successful right now instead of the worthless human I am"
"Depends where you live, and who you work for. 
I know the company I work for offers many resources for people with mental health concerns - talk to your manager or supervisor, they may be able to point you in the right direction. "
"Do you need a life preserver because it seems you may have gone off the deep end. 

Edit: This comment was hasty and emotional. I articulate myself at length in the comments below on specifically why I find OP's post distasteful. "
"Feeling the exact same way. With personal issues, family issues, friend issues, and all, I think I might have a depressed mood because of it all.

Try not to fret it *too* much (difficult, I know) and  ask for help if you need it."
Guilt is the main thing he is feeling now and yes it’s good that there is emotion coming back. It is a step in the right direction. It’s just so hard to know what to expect. I just want my lovely husband back. Hopefully soon.
"I have extreme anxiety. I'm taking prozac and hydroxizine, which both seem to work for the most part. I dont have any diagnoses; or my psych never said it. I've never had any visual hallucinations. Ill ask my doc next time i visit"

"It may be triggering but it's not about us. I think you and I have interacted before and you're a nice person, I like you. But this person clearly needs help so offense wasn't my first reaction, even if I have similar experience. "
It might also be getting worse cause i get seasonal depression at this time and im honestly starting to think ive been depressed cause i just cry and the weirdest time its like im always on the verge of crying for no reason at all
"Oh hun, I am so sorry you went through this. Good job on talking yourself down. I have nothing to offer you but lots of hugs and support. I don't drive (I am in my 40s) because of a fear of driving, so I feel you. Take care. &lt;3"
They can look into that. There is still a possibility that they will not but there is a possibility that they could. No file is ever really ''sealed'' from outside access especially from the military or some other government job.
"Well done, I'm happy to hear that you managed to reach out. Sometimes it never happens...
I hope your treatment goes well, all the best

(also I'm starting counselling tomorrow and it's finally the *right* time for me, so go us!!)"
"You did a wonderful thing...really. Try not to dwell on it too much, and just be secure in the fact that you saved a life. You can go talk to someone about it if you really feel stressed out about it, but today, you're my hero. :)"
"don try to prove them wrong (they might become deffensive or angry), dont agree with their delusion (you ll make him more delusional), try to change topic. Be there for him? he need to find the right medication for him to be fine."
"that's what I did, I'm officially quitting porn, blocked every website I could think of, do you think I'll feel this guilt forever...? I wish I could do something more and I can't and I feel terrible, and I feel like it's my fault"
"Hey, I'm also autistic and depressed and I know what it's like to feel like you're nothing to other people. Unless you want to be a charity, and there'd be nothing wrong with that, you're not going to be happy if you keep putting more in to someone than you get out, no matter who they are. If people aren't happy to receive from you, I'd say you should give less to them or try to find new people who appreciate you more, if you're lucky enough to find some you like and can talk to.  "
"I am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, a History of Anorexia Nervosa, Self-Harming behaviors, Alcoholism, and now the big one: Pyromania. I am messed up 10 ways to Sunday (as my older relatives say)...and none of that makes me a creep. It is pretty common to have 2 or even more things going on. We are complex beings. I hope you can talk to someone about your issues and feel better. I won't be scared away. If you need me, just message me anytime. :)"
"I have severe depression and even now (when the depression is ""in remission"") I can't seem to get into sex. I still love my husband with all my heart and I feel lonely and sad when he isn't here with me. Yet, feelings of intimacy are nil. I understand completely. I am also not really one who needs sex a lot (having 5 kids, I think I had that covered as a younger woman ha ha) but that also might be my age too. Having mental health issues has a huge impact on our sexual relationship."
"I think it just depends on the person, situation, and even individual mental health diagnoses (people may romanticize one illness while simultaneously demonizing another).  

Everybody's got their own experience, their own way of dealing with and viewing things.  I don't believe you invalidated your classmate's experience by sharing your own experience and world view, just as her sharing her experience shouldn't invalidate yours.  Your experiences are your own and both are valid.  "
"I used to do that. I would drink caffeine to numb the pain from the anxiety. I stopped drinking coffee because I found it was making my symptoms really bad. When I stopped, anxiety went down and didn't feel as much of a need to numb my emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I quit caffeine was to wean myself off over a period of a couple weeks. Then, I didn't touch it at all. If I had even a coke, I would feel like drinking more. I don't touch caffeine now, not even decaf coffee or soda."
"The best place to start I think is to see how often they are in touch after you move out. My father was very similar to yours and I haven't talked to him for years. Honestly, i feel great. I turned out fine. As frustrating as it is not having that ""ideal"" relationship with your parents, it's almost a relief when they're not influencing you negatively. As it sits right now, i don't have many friends and have no parental figures in my life that act like parental figures.
 I'm happy. "
"i'm not afraid of being in a crowd because i feel pretty anonymous when there's lots of people around me and the likelihood of someone addressing me is low, but i hate small get together's where i have to talk. the only way i deal with it is by asking lots of questions. it gets me out of my own head a bit and makes it seem like i'm friendly and curious about people. truth is i really don't care, it's just so they don't start asking me about my life. i really hate going out though. "
"As someone who has PTSD from childhood trauma, no, I think it is highly unlikely that one can get PTSD from screamers. It sounds to me like you are simply overly anxious to the extent of being paranoid and triggering attacks; which is still a condition that needs to be treated, but it is not PTSD. Post traumatic stress disorder is a serious and life ruining condition triggered by a severely traumatic event or events such as abuse, violence, or otherwise mortifying concepts that the majority of people would be mentally damaged by. 

I myself have anxiety and panic attacks with images popping up, screamers were a scary part of my youtube days and it can cause me to get paranoid; it is nothing like what a PTSD triggered attack is like."
"Check with your psychologists regulatory body or professional association. Here in Alberta the suggested price is $200 for 50 minutes. As a psychologist, I think that's outrageous. But it isn't about paying necessarily for expenses, it's paying for the knowledge, the very expensive education, licensing fees, and very expensive pre license supervision which costs the provisional psychologist something like 1 supervision session, which could be $200 an hour unless you were insanely lucky, for every six clients.

You could look at not-for-profits and government for lower-cost and no cost options. And you could also look for a psychologist who charges a sliding scale fee. Many of us have a few pro bono, and reduced rate spots available."
"I trawled through a bunch of meds before finding a combo that actually worked. I feel completely confident in saying it's not a placebo effect for me. I know plenty of people in a similar position.

The obvious answer to ""Do AD's work"" is ""Yes."" but ""Not as often as people think"" and ""only if you find the right one"". They're not 90% success rate wonder drugs you can just take and feel better. They're a long road of failed attempts that works kind of like trying to find the right form of birth control.

Both the ""wonder drug"" and ""big pharma lie"" factions are extremist views that don't accurately convey what antidepressants are, what they can and cannot do, and what they do for and to people. As usual, society is incapable of nuance."
"You should see a therapist qualified to work for you.

On a side note, your problems with self esteem have nothing to do with your makeup as a person. Nor are your problems the kind of thing that a simple acknowledgement can fix. While I can see that this person cares for you, and wants you to get better, most family and friends are not equipped to make significant changes to your psyche. A combination of psychiatric medication and therapy will give you the best prognosis. Treating your problems as symptoms of an illness, and not things you have control over will go a long way in your recovery. You can not think your way out of mental illness. You can not hope your way out. No one can love your illness away. I hope you realize that."
"Did the counselor recommend lexapro specifically?  Was the doctor a psychiatrist?

Nothing wrong with a counselor recommending you see a psychiatrist for medication. Recommending a specific one would make me leery. 

If your doctor isn’t a psychiatrist, drop him and go find one. A psychiatrist has the specialized training to take your reaction to various meds into consideration and work around that. They would never say “oh well, here’s some lexapro” (or if they do, find a different pdoc asap).

There are plenty of non-SSRI medications that can help anxiety, and you may need a combination of medications. 

It doesn’t have to be an either/or: live with anxiety or suffer side effects. Neither of those options make your life better. Go see someone who will work with you to make your life better. 

Edit to add: other people’s experience with a specific medication is irrelevant. Though the side effects may be similar, the effectiveness on your mental health will be different. "
"I won't lie you're in a though situation. Forgive me if you feel I'm being harsh it's the only way I feel I can explain my thought process. I'm not professional I'm only getting my insight and opinion. I suggest you contact them for a better guidance through this situation. 

I can fully understand why you needed to vent a about your situation, The situation with your mother is a difficult thing to deal with. I'm assuming because you're still in school your in the early twenties? having to deal with that growing up is hard. 

I hope we're all in agreement that your mother has a substantial mental illness. I can only imagine how it feels for you seeing her like that. It's however not your responsibility to enable her at your expense. She needs professional help. 

I'm not aware how she moved in with you. Did she just show up and refuse to leave? I do believe that you need to tell her to leave and get help. It's not your responsibility to harbor her, especially if she is detrimental to your health and won't get help herself. If she won't leave I'm assuming her name isn't on the lease contract call the police. 

I'm fully aware it sounds harsh too do against your mother. However if she's unwilling to get help and detrimental to your health it's the only way.  Your healing process can't start otherwise. 

For your mental health issues I highly recommend you get professional help. It's a difficult process. I can imagine that there are unprocessed emotions from your childhood and a lot more."
"(NB: Self-diagnosis should never include ""selling"" a doctor on a Dx. At most it should include suggesting it, so that you can be evaluated thoroughly in the normal manner. Anyone who's pushing a Dx is doing self-Dx wrong, and you're doing self-dx'ers a disservice by assuming we're all twisting our doctors' arms.)

""Selling"" an illness or treatment to a doctor is almost impossible. I have self-diagnosed conditions that are not professionally diagnosed, and self-diagnosed conditions that were later professionally diagnosed. I have self-Dx'd conditions that are professionally treated, and self-Dx'd conditions that are untreated. I also have conditions that were diagnosed and treated (or not treated) without my first recognising them.

From that 15 year breadth of experience in the mental health system, the one thing I have learned is you can't ""sell"" a doctor on anything they don't want to be sold on. Doctors are on a whole stubborn and biased. Presenting *any* of your own ideas to them puts you on supremely thin ice. It's a rare mental health professional who can hear a patient's ideas and take them on board without taking those ideas as some kind of slight to their professional reputation, a slight which must be responded to, generally by putting the patient firmly back in their place.

Even those who *do* listen to and take on board the information presented by patients, in my experience do not do so because they are being ""sold"" on anything. They do so because it's a patient report and patient reporting is part of the diagnostic process. They listen to what the patient says, ask further questions, compare it all together, and reach their own conclusions. And remember, these are professionals with plenty of experience. They know what these conditions look like when they present genuinely. They know how to compare that with people who are mistaken, or who are lying to meet the criteria. (If you believe otherwise, then you believe professional diagnosis is a sham and worth less than self-diagnosis. A valid view, to be fair.)

Perhaps it's different in other countries, but this has been the experience of myself (UK) and my friend (US). I don't doubt that there are some doctors who just diagnose whatever is suggested, but I do doubt that they're particularly common.

Self-diagnosis, and medical research in general, has benefited my life and the lives of those around me to an immeasurable level. It has led to medical interventions that have had a profound impact for me, as well as targeted therapy, and has been the key to understanding (and therefore working on and with) the way my mind works. My life and the lives of my loved ones have improved in leaps and bounds due to my self-diagnoses, and the professional validations that resulted of some of them.

I am doing exactly what you said in your post, ""finding a way to thrive"". It's not the way you approve of, but you are a complete stranger who doesn't know me or my life. So you're hardly in a position to judge what is or is not of benefit to me."
" 

People online will always be more mean to others and act differently to a certain degree simply because, well, it is the internet and that is partly the nature of it. We all know it is much easier to comment or voice an opinion online. We have probably all been there, we have all gone further than we wanted to/intended to/or would go in real life and said things online to others that we regretted later on, or even did so without realizing how it could affect another and not even giving it a thought really.

I am not saying that the internet is an excuse to do so and act like that, I am not saying we should just let it all happen. Things often go to far, even get to the point where they are just completely unacceptable. However, I personally think there is much more to this then what you seem to be implying.

Asking others to be nicer on the internet, it just really does not work like that and I think there is little use to it. It is good to think about it for a minute, realizing the possible extent of our words to others on the internet, yes, but if we can be honest here for a second ... we know that soon this just will be forgotten again and most people will not take much time to fall straight back into their old patterns. An environment like the internet will unavoidably lead this behaviour of ours towards a certain direction more than another because of its characteristics. There is an entire psychological aspect to this and a thread like this probably looks to some like a heroic attempt to make us change, and probably it actually is a really guine and well-meant effort ... And I often see topics such as these passing by, but I personally do wonder about the effectiveness and use of it.

&gt;Please be kinder in all of your interactions online

No. It does not work like that. I will not be more kind to anyone on the internet just for the sake of making sure nobody gets upset or even hurt. Not trying to sound super negative here, but I have to be honest with myself when it comes to this. I do actually try to stay polite as much as I can, I do try to not bash anyone or talk unreasonable shit to others on the internet just to get some fun out of it or whatever ... I know I might come across as a dick right now, so you would be surprised at how compassionate I can be towards others and how nice of a person I can actually be. But niceness is not something I try to spread all over, as if it were a goal of mine, no. If I would to that, would there even be any meaning left to it?

If ""mean"" should be based off a reason (and I think it should be, do not get me wrong), then why would I be nicer to simply anyone on the internet, despite their behaviour, despite what they are saying and so on. I am not here to solely be a people-pleaser and be compassionate to everyone and anything on here completely unconditionally. It took me a long time to realize the actual importance of truths and of not being protected from everything simply because of this or that. I learned so much more from other people being real to me and even explaining matters instead of just being nicer to me. And it also took me a long time to fully understand that I am more responsible for myself than I would have liked to admit.

So now I try to be as real as I can, as honest as I can. Oh, I never try to be inconsiderate to others on purpose, seriously. But I am not going to change my actual opinion about something, hold back everything or try to force myself to completely change my feelings towards something or someone just so that everyone would be happy and nobody would ever feel negativity anymore because the world has become such a nice place and everyone is nice to each other no matter what and it is all perfect. There is no use for that, because in the end the person on the other end will not benefit from my superficial and in that case forced and maybe even insincere kindness.

I am just trying to see the bigger picture here and putting things into perspective and trying admit to realities even though we often do not like them. I have no problem with trying to actually help others, and I do try to help where I can when I feel like it. I just honestly am convinced that ignoring someone else's actions completely and just being nice for the sake of being nice is not helping anyone."
"Have you ever been on an anti depressant before? When individuals with bipolar disorder are medicated solely with an anti depressant, it can trigger mania. You may need an additional antipsychotic to prevent the hypomanic episodes."
"I don't know. I've tried talking to professionals, but I just can't get the thought that they are only doing it because they get paid and not because they give a damn and it just makes me feel worse...

Thanks for responding tho :)"
"I feel like this is a bit too little too late being six hours later, but I hope you managed to talk to someone. I definitely hope you got somewhere a bit warmer and more comforting than a hospital floor as well, that sounds awful. "
"I think it happens when I feel somehow uncomfortable. I have a lots of intrusive thoughts, history of OCD, anxieties and depression. I keep daydreaming a lot and sometimes I get an uncomfortable feeling and start to squeez my eyes."
"I used to cry a lot at my office job bc of my depression and anxiety, and therapy did help me manage it a bit, and address my anxiety attacks at the source. Going for walks during office hours also helped. Maybe worth looking into?"
"I was actually thinking about talking to her today but missed an opportunity! She works from home most days, which is a benefit for me, but maybe next time she’s in I can at least introduce myself since she barely knows I exist. "
"I would give it time.  Sometimes you think you're fine and then out of nowhere, weeks, perhaps months later, you have an epiphanic moment where it all breaks through, and then you're destroyed for who knows how long.

Take it slow."
It does! Thank you! Asking what he needs is a good one. I tend to overlook this since by the time I get home from work he is in his room. I'm not the type to knock and check on him but maybe I should start. Thanks for the insight.
"It sounds like you are saying if you took hormones you would get kicked out and be homeless.  Your depression and anxiety may be making that reality up in your head.  I mean, did your Mom SAY she'd kick you out for taking hormones?"
It's just so stressful trying to work against it but I agree that it's useful to maybe just go at it as much as I can handle until I can handle more. And that's such a positive motive and sweet reason behind making that channel :)
"I’m bi polar. I get horrible depressive phases, sometimes last for a month or longer.  My manic phases aren’t as bad, sometimes I don’t notice it as much because I think I’m acting normal like everyone else, but I’m not. "
I’ve also been having headaches inside my brain as if someone was pinching a vein. It’s on and off but gets worse if my pulse goes up. Does this help in any way? I don’t know if this is medical or mental health to be honest.
"No, if you just simply want to talk to someone you can call them and their job is to listen to what you have to say. Whether is pertinent to their job or not they listen and talk you through your thoughts. Such as a therapist does."
"Ok, so I’m not depressed then. But something is definitely different/wrong. 

Getting more sleep would help me with my meals... but what about everything else on the list. Something has changed, and I want to know how to fix it. "
"Part of being not depressed, is just experiencing emotions as a normal person would. It doesn't mean you're suddenly happy all the time. A therapist can help you figure out what is normal emotions and what needs more intervention. "
"Thank you for taking the time out to suggest those things, I didn't even think of any of that. I eat sloppy right now, that is something that I have to work on. My other struggle are those lonely feelings... not being with family. "
"That's it. The feeling comfortable part. I feel that for me, it would be easier for me to talk to women about the subject matter, but that's just me. 'Know yourself and what works for you' is a good bit of advise in these instances"
"The main thing is that i just don't like him. I don't like spending time with him, it just drains me and makes me feel worse. I feel like an ass but i just don't want him in my life, he just doesn't bring me happiness or positivity"
When someone's involuntarily committed how soon can they get themselves out by lying? Will they be able to leave as long as they don't appear a risk to themselves or others but still believe they're a trillionaire head of the CIA?
"Yes!! There’s another one where you take a raisin (or anything small and edible really) and you feel it, smell it, taste it etc. It helps you recentre to the present rather then have your mind wander/panic in the past or future. "
You need to tell her the complete truth next time. Being honest is the only way you'll ever get better. Stop pretending that everything's okay and tell them how you really feel. There's no shame in admitting that you're struggling.
"If I remember right, what you have is called Maladaptive Daydreaming, or Fantasy Prone Personality.  I've got something similar myself, and yeah its a sense of escapism and power fantasies.  Delusions of grandeur because it's often one of the few if only places you can feel grand at all.

So I can relate all too well, so you're not alone in feeling the way you do.  If you can, look into a professional looking into this, as they'll have a lot more tools than I do atm to help you out."
"It could be an internal ear problem, but could be more dangerous.

Are you confused? Do you have trouble talking? Do you live alone? If not, just talk to someone about what happened.
If you are confused or having trouble talking, you should consider going to the er.

If not, well just try and look up : is the symptoms are worst? If yes, it might be labyrinthitis.  You will still have to go to the doctor, but you could go to a clinic. Just write down every time you feel the symptoms."
"I’m still in highschool so definitely take this with a grain of salt - but have you explored and found passions? For example if you love love love drawing and painting, you could incorporate that into your career and life in someway. You could be in that field or you could make sure that you are creating art every few days or weekends just to keep you level. Not sure if this helped at all but know that you aren’t the only one who struggles with this, and that you aren’t alone!"
"Oh fuck that sounds dangerous. I used to have episodes of pyromania when I got high on weed a few years ago I'd sneak into public places like schools and burn random stuff then get the fuck out before being noticed. Unfortunately I got caught and chased a few times but I ran until I was safe. That is long gone by now fortunately but there's always a way for insanity to manifest itself. Not easy living like this, especially last few days. I wish the Moon would just fuck off already. "
"it used to be like that. I used to just adapt to whoever I was around, always trying to make people happy and be accepted. I still was my own individual, but i would change depending on the circumstances. For the last 2 years, that's gone and now I just wake up and I don't even know who or what the fuck I am. Every day I feel like a bit different, and I never really feel like myself. Every day it's a little bit of the old me here and a little bit there. Wouldn't wish this on anyone."
"I don't have the answer, it was just to suggest some things because while everyone can feel stressed at times, there are different levels of stress and some people react to severe stress very intensely.

You can of course also always search online about angry outbursts and write as detailed a description of yourself as possible because there might be some ideas as to what it can be, especially since you don't know yourself what the problem is exactly. It can be something as simple as your brain changing due to your age and it can be a symptom of something important. Just make sure you don't have some kind of brain tumor - it's been known to affect and change people's personalities in terms of depression, anger and violent tendencies."
"I have never tried to kill myself but I have thought about it like 2-3 times where I thought “is this the night I will do it? Kill myself? Maybe... I don’t know, I know I’m crying and aching and I want it to stop now.” 

I never attempted it because what stopped me was how I would leave my relatives and family and possibly the one killing me depending on how I would end up killing myself. The world wouldn’t be the same without me. Neither would it be if any who’s alive right now killed themselves. 

YOU can make a difference. You can bring someone’s hope up and save them from killing themselves. You never know. Maybe you’ve already done it. 

Suicide in general is a lame and selfish action. Because it doesn’t make anyone feel happy. It will only help you if you succeed. But I understand how bad one can want to do it. It’s really horrible and something that should be taken seriously in almost every case. 

And yes. I’m very happy you’re still alive! ❤️��"
"May I ask how you know your son will be placed or end up with a family that acts like a family and has structure?  How old is he?

If you have a disability and are unable to work, theoretically, you would be eligible for benefits.  There is a process to accessing them, which you are likely aware of, but if not, there is SSI and others, which I'm blanking on at the moment.  I'm a psychologist, and the benefits piece is more social work.  There are options available, although I know it's an overwhelming and frustrating process to get things going.  

Have you considered a brief period of hospitalization?  Their multidisciplinary treatment team should be able to help you address the aspects of your life in which you struggle.  They will get you on appropriate medication, have you participate in therapy/groups (depending on the setting), assist with benefits, etc.  A good hospital will link you up with services before you're discharged, so you have a plan.  

If you need to talk, PM me.  "
"Nope.  In my experience both personally and with folks I've worked with, it rarely works out but just creates another method of avoiding getting the help the person actually needs.


Studies show that people experiencing depression and/or anxiety will have the best outcomes with a combo of meds and therapy.  It generally looks like this though therapy and meds&gt; therapy w/o meds&gt; meds without therapy&gt; nothing at all.  


It can be really easy to go down a slippery slope of self-medicating with addictive substances which makes the problems worse overall.  Supplements and eating healthy are always going to improve your mood if vitamin deficiencies were contributing, but they're not going to solve severe issues with depression/anxiety.  


You should never take psych meds without working with a psychiatrist and/or general practitioner.  


As far as nootropics go, I can't remember who said this but it's spot on ""If alternative medicine worked, it would just be called medicine.""  "
"Thanks for the link, I'll check out their resources. I've been wishing there were some sort of support group for people having to grieve their loved ones exhibiting criminal behavior. His birthday was the other way and my wife was super depressed about not wishing him a happy day. But it's also where the recent concern came from. He can walk into a gun store and walk out with a gun in 20 minutes now if he so desires.
The anxiety is too real though and we talked about moving into an RV until we're done with our degree programs in the spring. This would help with concealing utilities also because we wouldn't have any, plus no rent to pay and no permanent address. We could feel safe and relocate as we felt necessary (within reasonable distance from campus) and not have to worry about being tracked.
I appreciate you responding, we've only had each other through this for awhile. My wife goes to therapy, but it's been a few weeks since she's gone and it's been getting harder for her lately."
"Yeah, I get that. I don't think that you're lazy though. Having a constant internal battle with yourself is exhausting, especially without the proper tools to manage it. It's one thing knowing that you want to change, but having the right skill set to do so is sometimes a whole other ballgame. However, there are small steps you can take to get to get to where you need to be. I find that online communities like this can be useful for support from people who understand from a similar perspective. In addition, I'd again recommend seeing a doctor for a diagnosis or a therapist. Personally, I did a DBT program and it changed my life. I was a complete wreck before and now I'm much more stable and secure. I would highly recommend it for the symptoms you're describing. If you're not ready for therapy, you can even buy a dbt workbook online and work through it on your own. You're not a piece of shit, you're not lazy, and you're not alone in this. I know I don't know you, but I believe in you. "
"I get where you're coming from. It can make you feel like you're crazy sometimes, especially when you're dealing with the symptoms of more than one of the disorders at the same time. But mental disorders are like physical disorders. Many people struggle with asthma, allergies, and eczema at the same time. These are closely linker together. It's the same with mental illness. I struggle with OCD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Pyromania, issues with substance abuse, and although this one isn't officially diagnosable yet, I also have Dermatillomania. 

It can make me feel as though I'm a lost cause, even though that's certainly not the case. When one of my issues starts to go into a phase where it ""recedes"" I find that my other issues lessen in severity, or even let up completely. 

If you ever need someone to talk to, who can relate to what you're going through, don't hesitate to message. Having multiple mental health issues is a definite struggle, and managing them all (especially if you're on many different pills/different types of therapy)  can be made even more complicated. 

It really sucks to see another person going through this. Mental Illness is a terrible thing. "
My ex walked out when my youngest was 2 and my oldest was 9 and my middle child was 6. I ended up having a mental breakdown and I also lost my job and then our home. That train wreck portion of my life lasted about 2 years and another 2 years towards my recovery I'm finally feeling better about myself and going back to work. It was a very difficult time in my life. I don't have any family of my own. Other than my kids. I was very suicidal and depressed. My kids are finally getting older and more self sufficient so I am feeling safer about returing to work. You're heading into very difficult waters and I feel bad for everything that you will have to go through. Encourage your husband to be there for his child. I early on decided that I would never bad mouth my ex-wife in front of my kids and I can proudly say that I never have. My children know that thier mother loves them because I tell them. She made a terrible mistake by leaving them and that mistake she cannot undo but my kids know that she loves them. Your husband is in the process of making a terrible mistake but I hope he won't turn his back on his child. Good luck to you.  Get a social worker. A social worker can help you get the help that you are going to need during this time.
"Hey, So I have a *LOT* and I mean a *LOT* of friends who have bipolar disorder and I'm sorry to say it sounds to me as though you must have it too. The bad news is it actually incurable and will remain with you the rest of your life. However, the good news is you can get therapy to help deal with your episodes and keep track of when you're feeling high and low - almost like your menstrual cycle (which can actually effect it as well); and go onto medication to keep you stable, or at least more stable than you are now.

Your best bet is to visit your Doctor as soon as possible to get diagnosed and then they can help you with medication and therapy options best suited to you and your schedule. You need to be *PERSISTENT*. Explain in depth the contrast of feelings and the routine to which they seem to come. Lots of people seem to have a narrow minded view on bipolar - that it's a snap change in emotion within seconds or minutes, but that is not entirely true! Some bipolar's can go through daily episodes and some (like you from the sounds of things) monthly episodes.

The key to this disorder isn't attempting to overcome or ignore it, it's learning, accepting and understanding it. It's all about knowing which days are your good days, which are your bad and doing the things you can to make those days easier for yourself.

Hope this has been some help - and hope everything goes well for you.

(Yes I did post this to another r/mentalhealth thread and edit it but it still fits this scenario too)"
"I can relate to so much of that ... 

I’ve started using a light therapy box as of about two weeks ago. Sometimes, I think it’s helped with my circadian rhythm stuff, but now it’s midnight and I can’t sleep. So ... I dunno. Still keeping with it to see if it helps. Haven’t noticed specific mood benefits from it either, but, again, still trying it. 

Getting off my anti-depressants helped. For now. Sort of. I can focus a little better and accomplish minuscule tasks, but I’m still mostly worthless for getting anything done. And, the low swings are lower. 

I want to try psilocybin, but it’s not legal here, so it’s a bit dodgy. Weed helps me sleep, but that’s not legal here either. I’ve actually considered joining one of those churches that were started for substances so I could have a religious exemption for weed and shrooms.

A couple of months ago, I adopted a dog. She’s been a help, but not a big one. And, I feel guilty for not taking her out for walks very much. 

Last week, I had a blood draw done, and a second one today. There may be some underlying hormonal issues that are at least contributing to the severity of my symptoms. I’ll have to wait for at least the results of this second draw, if not also more of them, to know anything for sure. I doubt all of my ills are going to be revealed in my labs, but even if I can get just a small improvement, it’s something. 

I also think I need out of here. This place is mega toxic for me. The people, the vibe, the landscape ... I did better when I was homeless and parked on PCH in Northern California a few years ago. Ocean waves and breezes, the mountains, forests ... nature is good. It doesn’t fix me and I was lonely as hell, but at least some things were better. "
"Well, I can only share my own experience, hoping something resonates with you... it's my understanding that some people won't click with their counselor right away. That said, when you do click and feel comfortable with one, they help you navigate the maze your thoughts can become and untie the knots. That's all I have to say about that.

Also, don't underestimate the power of meds. I had the same fear as you, I definitely don't wanna rely on them, but 1) The smallest dose made my anxiety attacks go away (And i was having them every day, for hours, I was losing all functionality due to feeling sick AF). Same with the antidepresant. My mood swings weren't awful swings anymore. And I didn't feel ""numb"" or anything. I was just calm/centered enough to go about my day like a healthy human being.

Once my chest wasn't killing me I was able to focus on what's going on inside my mind. Going to therapy to work out traumas. Meditating to keep calm, replace intrusive bad thoughts/overthinking, draggin myself to the gym some days to break a sweat, go out and hang out with friends etc. 2) If you (example) had GERD (chronic acid reflux) you would probably had to take a pill a day, period. Why is mental health any different/unaccepted? Sometimes our brains are chemically fucked up  \[haha, genetics!\], you said your dad is the same. In my case my whole mom's side of the family has somatization issues (body symptoms coming from anxiety/stress): mom, uncle. When I heard my young cousin complain she had health issues and was trying homeopathic BS because of stress I thought ""That's it. We all have the same thing"" and made an appointment with a psychiatrist. BOY IM GLAD I DID. Like I said, everyone's different and just a little dose changed my life 180 degrees, but like I told myself when I went to the psychiatrist for the first time, I'm so desperate it's worth the try. I was also at my wits end and thinking of hurting myself, but had all the same concerns as you. Deep down I had goals and projects I wanted to see through, so I knew I didn't wanna die in my case. I just needed an immediate escape from the intolerable body pain. I told myself I'd give it 3 months to see if they were good or bad. I felt the effects within a week.

Suicidal intrusive thoughts aren't particularly a conclusive sign you want to die, either. There is a line that is crossed between thinking about it and when you start making actual plans, get stuff ready, etc. -at least that's what I've learnt from my counselor-.  Last week I had a very bad anxiety attack due to PTSD, my chest went over the roof so badly pills didn't make effect..brain went on auto-destruct mode and I said to myself ""fuck ima just go jump off the bridge"" (its full of bridges here in Chicago). I didn't wanna die, I just can't deal with how bad the pain is. I was this close to getting myself to the ER but an hour walk to go run an errand actually helped me pull my act together until I saw counselor \[shrug\].

&amp;#x200B;

I know you don't wanna hear ""this is temporary"" but consider this: it hasn't gotten better because you really haven't taken care of it the right way/haven't found what works for you. In that case, temporary is gonna be forever because you aren't being successful at finding the cause. In my case it's a bit of a chemical imbalance added to the fact that I was in an abusive marriage that I have to fully process/heal from. But you know what? I had been suffering from false heartburn and that aweful chest pain for the same amount of years (since I was a teenager), kept getting enraged when all my blood work came back A-OK and I still felt like shit. In your case it could also be just the chemical inbalance. But you won't know if you don't get help, try new ways of coping (healthy ones, not self-harming). There might be a whole list of things you could try but you don't know about them so you're still suffering.

Yes it's frustrating as fuck trying things and failing. But it also sucks wasting your potential of doing fun things in your life just because your brain can't produce enough serotonin and you thought there was no point in living. You can probably tell I'm a very science-y person by now.

&amp;#x200B;

That was my experience. I also don't have ""a shitty life"", I have a ton of things to be grateful for even though I'm living abroad away from family/friends, I'm doing relatively fine, healthy/sane boyfriend included, etc, yet I still have some intrusive suicidal thoughts from time to time. I put my life under the microscope every once in a while and that's when I know I have a low. My way of coping is just sleeping a lot and painting how I feel, then it usually lasts for a few days and then I feel better. Idk. I hope that gave you something to think of.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck!

"Can you ask your doctor for some techniques to cope with that? And how about carrying a pillow or stuffed animal to ""pet"" along the way? (real animals not recommended since they may misinterpret your panicky behaviors as aggression)"
"I agree with another comment on here.  Book on to see a doctor. Memory and cognitive issues can go hand in hand with depression and anxiety.  You really need to rule out anything else going on.  Esp ad you have been passing out.  

"
"I have one relatives in law enforcement (US) and he has some pretty gruesome stories.  He says you get used to it?  Not that I am going to try.

Something like what happened to her is traumatic but she should be fine in a few weeks."
"I would certainly be affected. I'm sure the guy who serves you coffee every morning would be affected. I've lost people who I didn't know entirely well, and it still affected me. You should live, you have plenty to look forward to. "
Just be kind and understanding. But also make sure he knows that life sometimes gets in the way. There's nothing you can do about it. And it's just something he'll have to accept. Just show him that you care and things will be fine.
"Mental health will never be truly understood because of how little evidence there is physically to some of the conditions we suffer with, it's as if, if it can't be seen then it doesn't exist, very typical and a sad reality for many"
No its painless. You get muscle relaxer and then thru put you asleep. Next thing you know you're awake and you sit in a recovery chair for like an hr then you go home. Nbd. Seriously compared to meds its safer with less side effects
Seems normal for the most part as you would want certain people to see you a certain way. Perhaps this could stem from a feeling of inferiority or low self image. If you have a therapist this might be worth bringing up in a session.
"Thank you for the reply, this is one the possibilities I was afraid of, I didn’t want to put out there since I didn’t want to seem too biased. 

I am not sure what could be done at this point (other than leaving the situation). "
"Thanks for the answer, I used to go but I left it 2 years ago. I still go to psychiatrist though and she is excellent. I think I will bring it up to her. Sometimes this fear goes away and I forget, but it happens regularly I notice "
idk how i would go about talking to a therapist. Even bringing up the idea to my parents scares me. If i did they sure as hell wouldn’t pay for it and i’m in high school and i don’t have a ton of money for a bunch of therapy..
"Are you looking for a solution this very moment? Or are you looking for something long term? Because if it's the second one, then you need to go see a doctor. He can prescribe you medication for your anxiety. I would also recommend therapy as well.

If it's something you're looking to solve right now then there's not a whole lot you can do. You'll just have to force yourself through it until the anxiety starts to go away or get better. Just take it easy until things start to improve."
"Gonna get downvoted. 

I don’t know if you saw the hbo documentary on that performance artist “the artist is present”, but a lot of the stuff they did (man and woman) was very physical. They would full on run into each other without protecting themselves over and over.

It wasn’t just painful stuff they did.

You could bring it up in class in front of everyone and then if you felt like it didn’t get resolved well you could speak to someone about transferring to a new class?"
"Hmmm...this made me think of something I went through just the other day. I was walking like normal and all of a sudden, I kept seeing everything on fire. I wanted to set everything on fire too. Before I knew it, almost an hour had zipped by me and I was walking home. I was disoriented and scared. I guess that might be closer to dissociation but guess what tirggers my fire-setting behavior?  Yep. Anxiety. It was pretty high that day.

I wish you good luck and I hope you feel better!!"
"I do get that's the basic intention going on in both cases. I think it's just more difficult when someone is struggling with mental health issues, as it can easily start feeling more empty and disingenuous, even when that's not the intention. 

I think it really comes down to delivery. Do they sound polite or friendly when saying it? Or is it really abrupt and non-consequential? I think that's the answer. Though someone who is abrupt may just by in a hurry, so I guess it all depends."
"I have had that same problem before. Im not sure how long its been now. I caved once after a few years. Now i think its been a little over 1 year since that. Its definitely not easy. I still get urges, more so lately. Jhst do what you can to distract yourself. I just started painting this week after not having done so in 8 years. It helps. Video games help sometimes. Go on walks, listen to music. Write. Draw. Play an instrument. Anything to keep your hands busy. 
It will get easier. "
"I was almost 302ed (involuntarily committed) twice within 6 weeks of each other, but they gave me the option of signing myself into a psych hospital here in the States. It wasn't a fun time, but I got the help I needed. Needless to say, I really needed the meds and therapy. I had just tried to commit suicide on two different occasions. If she really needs to go, you should call. The alternative is her killing herself, and that would be much worse for you and everyone else. Good luck."
"I'm relatively new to this subreddit, so forgive me if I'm wrong. Why do you feel as though those ""over thirty"" need their own space? Mental illness doesn't discriminate based on age, and having lived on this earth longer doesn't mean your journey is necessarily different/worse/better than others that aren't over thirty. Personally I'm 25 and can acknowledge that although unique, my experiences aren't any better or worse than the next person. We all wear pain and trauma the same way."
"I can't give you that much advice but from my experience trauma/grief counseling and mental illness counseling tend to have different, uh, vibes. So hating one doesn't mean you'll hate the other. 

Personally, I'm managing anxiety, depressive tendencies/past depressive episodes, and some other funsies on the side through a mix of two medications, vitamins, regular exercise, weekly therapy, trying to fix my social life, stimming for anxiety, actually talking to my family about my problems, practicing dbt and breathing exercises, and slowly working on a routine that accommodates my quirks (for me, that looks like everything from taking lots of breaks to carrying headphones everywhere lmao). And I still don't feel perfect, but who does. "
"I had a similar situation in undergrad. I had a severe bout of anxiety during one of my classes early in the semester and then every class after that I was worried I would have another (which only made me more anxious). I found it useful to sit in the back and doodle while taking notes. It gave me something to do with my nervous energy but I was still able to listen. Also I would normally do something that I liked that day, like buy lunch instead of bring it. It gave me the incentive to keep going to class. Eventually this professor will likely calm down a bit and you will also get more used to his demeanor. So if you give yourself something to like 'reward' yourself for going to class, then you might learn what will help you faster. "
"I have a long list of activities through my life I've ditched or avoided at the last hurdle, I also see it in other aspects of life where I'm very prone to just avoid entirely because it's easier.

Riding a motorbike doesn't sound like anything you should shame yourself for, for not doing. That impresses the hell out of me and isn't a common skill at all. 

I would say take your time, take a break and revisit it. Some things need tike - you clearly want this so I'm sure you'll get there. You don't need to do all your classes at once, just be patient. Oh and also put what your friends may or may not think behind you, it's irrelevant. Do it for you.  Your friends being your friends I'm pretty sure they won't judge you at all regardless."
"Yes immense. It still took 6-8 months to find the right meds but it shortened the list to about 5 meds that would work for me. Plus my doc is a badass who aggressively attack’s depression. There were moments that were grueling, moments that made me feel worse than I originally did. But I was willing to attack it that way. I fucking hated how I felt originally and the way she talked just made go “you know what fuck it, lets do it. ” All the trial and error in those six months were totally worth it. Just stay strong and believe you can get better. Because you can. Even though your body breaks it down it can still not work the best FYI. It just means that drugs you DON’T break down will NOT work for you. If that makes sense lol. "
"You are doing something you HATE. Where the fuck can you find motivation for that. Change your job. Quit, find something else you would like to do. It may feel like you do not want to do anything now. You may feel like that for a while. Yes, that’s the aftereffect of forcing yourself to do something you hate and all the self-blaming. Give yourself an indefinite time to rest, relax and not think or do anything. There WILL be a time when you’ve recovered enough to get back on your feet and slowly regain the energy to find something you love doing again. Just don’t rush it or push yourself. This is all of course based on personal experience and you may not feel exactly the same as I do. Any how, I hope this is of some help to you. "
"&gt; **He told me he thought I had a ""mild form of BPD.""**

Buffet, BPD is a spectrum disorder, which means that every adult on the planet exhibits the nine BPD symptoms to some extent (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).  Moreover, we all occasionally get flareups of our usual BPD traits, temporarily pushing us to the upper end of the BPD spectrum.  

These flareups can be caused by drug abuse but usually are caused by strong hormone changes, as occurs during puberty, PMS, pregnancy, postpartum, or perimenopause.  Significantly, these ""temporary"" flareups sometimes can last for 1 to 3 years (e.g., as occurs with pregnancy, postpartum, puberty, and perimenopause).  This is why the diagnostic criteria require that BPD symptoms not only be strong but also persistent (over many years).

I mention all this so as to explain why your psychologist's conclusion that you have a ""mild form of BPD"" does not mean you have the full-blown disorder.  Rather, it only means you are human."
"I agree with magpiegoo. For me, I may be self-diagnosing right now, but how the heck can it be anything BUT what I am thinking. It is SO specific, so obvious, that there is NO gray-area. This helps me because once I can fully admit it, I can start to heal. I need the name of this repeated over and over until my mind stops rebelling against it, accepts it, and lets me deal with it. I am not there. I need someone to come right out and say it to my face (so to speak) that I am suffering from (that word). According to my best friend, I am still in denial...and I guess so. I can't deal with this and I am hiding my problem from everyone except the bestie. :( I dunno. The stupid part is that when I go to the Psych next week, she may or may not ""officially"" dx me with this...I don't know. That doesn't change the fact that I have an obsession with something...I have strong and unmanageable compulsions a lot of the time...and that I need to hear her say that word so I can get the help I need. :("
"I sometimes feel this way, usually at the beginning of a relationship. For me, it's a mixture of genuine anxiety and a history of having a partner who made me feel like I had to constantly question things. I know that if I don't talk about it, it will only build itself up in my imagination to be 1000x worse than reality. So I address it with my boyfriend and tell him I am anxious and just need to check in. I word it exactly like that. I ask if we are good/peachy/whatever I decide to describe it as and let him know that I'm not asking because of anything he's done to make me feel insecure, but a culmination of things that feel out of my control. He's perfect and patient and wonderful and talks about it with me and because we have built this level of transparency, I have learned that I don't NEED to ask or be anxious because if something is off, he will tell me. I hope you can get to this place with your partner, too. Communication, especially about the tough stuff, is key. Best of luck!"
"Thank you. 

I do see what you’re saying. I’m not in denial about having depression, or that it’s only caused by external sources...

But when I’m alone/isolate myself I have a better grip on it. I do things throughout the day that make me feel better, make healthy choices, self care (gym, therapy), I try to make as much progress as possible, and feel like I’m on the right track to doing so... 

Then I’m around these family members/at home and I feel anxious, I feel like I have to walk in egg shells, I feel like any moment someone is going to get mad at me for doing something either a) that I didn’t do or b) something very minor and insignificant... and worst of all being home makes me feel like all the progress I made is worthless because I’m doing everything wrong....

It’s just night and day when I’m by myself compared to when I’m around these people... and I’m not sure how to bridge that gap or make myself not feel so depressed when I HAVE to be around them "
"It's possible that you do value it, but don't realize it, because you've never been away from it. Also, it's normal to distance yourself throughout your teenage and young adult years. Biologically, we are inclined to to that because that's when we're supposed to be ""leaving the nest.""

If you move out and start your own young adult life, your relationship with your family will shift. If it's a healthy attachment and a healthy shift, you will miss them and feel excited to see them when you visit, but you will not necessarily have the desire to live with them or spend as much time with them as you did when you were a kid. This is because you're developing into your own adult self, and part of that requires rejecting the need for the supports you had as a kid.

If it's an unhealthy attachment, you will grow more distant and have no desire to see them.

Edit:   
I should also add that not all of it is necessarily you having a problem. Parents have to be able to manage that shift in a healthy way too. It's natural for parents to feel sad about their children detaching, but they need to support the need for independence. If your mom is trying to guilt trip you for your growth, that's an unhealthy behavior on her part, not yours.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Awhh. That’s so rough for both of you. It’s really wonderful that you want to help her. Try getting her to see a therapist, since this seems like pretty difficult trauma she’s dealing with. I had a shitty abusive relationship when I was 17, but it didn’t last as long, and I wasn’t too deeply affected. My current boyfriend did a few things that have helped me get better.

Firstly, establish trust. She seems like she’s comfortable opening up to you, which is great. Don’t break that trust. Make sure you don’t judge or get offended when she shares her feelings with you because you don’t want to discourage it.

Secondly, don’t make her feel like she’s obligated to do anything extra for you, or that she’s somehow in your debt for helping her. Presumably, you’re doing this simply because you care about her, so make sure she knows that she doesn’t have to pay you back or anything. Make sure she knows she’s not a burden to you.

Figure out how to subtly check on her. My boyfriend does this, I suspect. He’s somehow able to detect when I’m struggling without asking. The asking part can sometimes trigger me, so he gets around it by picking up on my subtle cues.

Remind her that she’s strong and that she’s doing really well. The struggle she faces is totally legitimate and it’s important that she knows that she’s doing her best and there’s no “normal recovery speed” to match up to.

If she likes being physically comforted, do that too.

Hope this helps!"
"Oh, this is something that so many of us go through and it really can only be exacerbated as we age as we will encounter more and more people that may be considered better off than us. Trust me, comparing ourselves to others can be such a burden to bear. I want to let you know it is a common thing and that it can take a while to navigate it. Truthfully, in my life, I like to take two approaches to these kinds of situations. One is that I try and consider that the very fact I bear these feelings symbolizes I would like to grow and evolve myself, which in and of itself can be motivating and is noble. Secondly, I try and honor something I hear often in yoga classes, which is that we are all on our own journey and so need to honor that.

In my eyes, it's good to come to a philosophy about things. I've shared how I interpret my feelings, but I think it's good to develop/honor your own thoughts. Don't be afraid to sit with the emotions. However, don't be afraid to switch to a new therapist if it does bother you.. we won't always be ready to face every challenge in life. Hey, you never know how things will turn out and I bet there are a lot of great things about you that you don't realize, from qualities to stories from your life. Anyways, life is full of comparing and judging, so it's good to come to terms with it. Even in the workplace, you'll encounter all sorts of dynamics, from power struggles to jealousy to downright rudeness. Life is a trip so try to enjoy it. Also, you can always model yourself after people you admire and do try and cultivate yourself. I seriously think everyone has some goodness in them.. it might be hidden away like gold that a dragon guards, but you can find it. Maybe I'm overly hopeful, but I wish you well. 

Namaste"
"In response to the title question, I would say that it is possible to hold yourself back from getting better, but that's often the result of mental illness out of your control. Not to get into one of my hippie schpiels, but experiencing an alternate perspective can give you a deeper awareness of what's holding you back. I started with a much needed marijuana binge personally that changed my life, but an alternative could be some honest feedback from different people. The trick is to treat those opinions as truth in their reality, and combine it with the truth you're dealing with. Hearing different perspectives though isn't nearly the same as experiencing them and having your eyes forced wide open.

No, this isn't all your fault and it's not just you imagining it. You were born a certain way, raised a certain way, and live in an insane world. For those who've never experienced what you're dealing with, their reality is stuff like ""no it's just you,"" and even psychiatrists opinions are just that. You know what you're dealing with. 

Take baby steps in coping with your illness. It's not about eliminating the illness, but learning how to live with it until it dims out. Start with figuring out ways not to let these things eat at you, but benefit you instead. If you're able figure out a way to honestly say to yourself, ""Okay mom. That's what you think. I'm not going to let it hurt me, but rather try to use it to my benefit,"" then you're already halfway there. 

Second step I'd take is learning how to cope with the adhd (as you've noted it may be the source), until it's not a burden on your life but rather a honed gift that most others don't have.

Thirdly, if something is working, you should continue working your way through to your other issues. One coping mechanism that's helped me is making a list of all the issues I'm currently having that I can think of in my own words, and checking it every now and then to see how things change. This is especially helpful with the waves of bipolar disorder, because when things get better we trick our brains into forgetting aspects of our illness, and it can be hard later to remember how to phrase the exact problems we're dealing with. Let me know if I can do anything else, hope that helps, and best of luck!"
"I always hate the kind of responses you find in threads like these; yes, he sounds toxic as hell; yes there may be a disorder you can link to his behavior; it doesn't fucking matter. People aren't disorders, actions have consequences, behavior has reasons.

In the end, I don't think it matters what mental illness you link to his behavior. He sounds deeply traumatized and very insecure, as if most of his behavior is to overcompensate for some deep, dark shit.

There is no way that if he shot people during the war, that he actually feels proud or happy or great about having done it. _No way_. I can tell you that with absolute certainty. There are two kinds of responses killing can evoke in people; it either breaks you, or it does nothing to you. The second only happens if you're a full-blown psychopath; and I can tell you he's not a psychopath.

There's a reason you're with him; you love him, despite of whatever nasty responses are given in this thread, ""he's Borderline, he's narcissistic, he's traumatized, he's toxic, he's fucked up""; borderline people can be loved, narcissistic people need love more than anyone else^1, traumatized people are estranged from themselves, and need to be reconnected to their actual selves, toxic people may just be hurt; _no person is a disorder_. There was something about him that attracted you, is that still there? Was it ever there to begin with?

My guess? He's really broken and hurt. _Really, really fucking deeply broken and hurt_.
He uses the behaviors you listed to compensate for his unprocessed pain, his insecurity shows through his belittling -- _""Are you deaf?"" or ""Are you dumb?""_, his fear of being abandoned by you by controlling you -- _Very possessive over me. Made me delete all my friends on social media but my 2 close friends and my family._.

Ask yourself these three questions, think about them deeply.

1. Why are you with him, do you want to be with him?
2. Do you think he has the self-awareness and courage to accept that his behavior is seriously fucked up, and that he needs help? If he doesn't, do you want to stay with someone who seriously limits you to live your life the way you want to?
3. If he does admit that (1) his behavior is *fucked up*, and (2) that he authentically wants to get better, will you be there for him while he's drowning in darkness?

And last, but most important.

**Are you happy?**

^1 Although, narcissists are the most pervasively fucked up people around, the problem with narcissism isn't limited to their behavior; borderline people, sociopaths can be way worse, but they often have a sense of humanity in themselves _somewhere_, _somehow_. While traumatized people are estranged from themselves; narcissists have literally _lost_ themselves. They don't have an identity, and live their lives through others. It is nearly impossible to truly help a narcissist, since all help solely relies on whether they can see their own behavior as wrong; but there is no ""own"", there is no ""self"", there is only other people, and they are wrong."
Actually I do have a question. Do you know how I could get all this done without my parents knowing (I'm 16)? And do you know how the canadian mental health system works? I'm planning on asking my therapist during my next appointment
"Depression is a chemical imbalance in your brain. And it can get whacky sometimes, even without a trigger. It sucks, but meds can help you thru that so your serotonin levels don’t drop so significantly. You’ll get there, friend. "
"Does he not *want* to go to therapy or can he not *afford* therapy?

There is a huge difference and all of the ""If it really mattered, he'd find the money"" sentiment in the world won't change not being able to afford to see a doctor."
"Fair question. Its obvious this incident is causing you to view yourself negatively, as if something is wrong with you. It is impacting your feeling of self worth, such that you are willing to reach out to strangers on the internet. "
"Happy to hear your doing better. May was my one year. Its been hard but its true things get better. Keep your head up high, same to anyone on this thread reading this. I want you all to know i care and hope we all find peace in life."
"I don't know if you are schizophrenic, but those are some paranoid delusions.  Therapy might be a good idea to help learn to cope with your brain doing that to you.  Medication might make those feelings being judged go away entirely."
"I have to agree with This-Is-Peppermint. You guys need to go talk to someone. I had Anorexia Nervosa, and it does not get better without the help and guidance of a professional. Same with Depression/Anxiety. Good luck to you both. :)"
"May be your childhood was not so much happy and your apathy is a kind of coping mechanism .You can't magically change your feeling towards family . If you have sympathy for someone or something in world , you are completely normal . "
"Some places aren't rhis bad. I really liked my spot, and according to patients who were there when I was, there are some really good, and some really bad. It depends on what's available, what your insurance covers, and what you know."
"Thank you for sharing that with me. I’m proud of you for knowing the right way to manage it even if it came after using alcohol. 

He was 19-20 when he was diagnosed. It started his freshman year of college. He died at 30 years old"
"Thank you! Ill try mediating and happy to put in the work. Ive been recommended the headspace but didnt realise it could help with my sleeping.

Im not on any medication and would prefer to not take any but will if needed. Thank you!"
"That sucks some things that help me are to make it very dark at night, to drink tea, and listen to music. Sometimes when I was starting to freak out because I can't sleep I would take a bath and just try to stay calm. Hope this helps"
"Well I can't tell you if it's worth it, because I'm not in your head. I think whether or not you can deal with it yourself is something you have to figure out. 

Counseling can always help. It's up to you if you think it's worth it. "
"What do you feel while the person is talking to you? Do you feel like you're receiving the information,?
 Do you feel like you're in a state of panic while you listen? Or do you perhaps have problems focusing on what the person says?"
"Yeah, I was on Zoloft but it caused hypomania. I haven't had it before that or since then, and I've stopped taking Zoloft, so I was just wondering if it would happen again without taking antidepressants. I'm in a mood stabilizer now."
"You got this. :) I like how you say you're a good catch! That is awesome to hear someone say that and I am sure it is true. Love will find you, no worries. Just keep your head up and I hope you feel better!  


Sending love your way!"
"You need to stop bending over backwards for other people. Learn how to say ""no"" to somebody if necessary. If people don't respect you then, then don't bother going out of your way to help them. Don't let people take advantage of you."
"thank you, its nice to hear that. it can be, but my panic disorder unfortunately can come hand in hand with everything. but you deal with it too. we're not alone, but we, while it may not even be curable, can still kick its ass &lt;3"
":/ With OCD the trick is push to yourself forward. Keep trying to move on. By doing activities :such as exercising, working out at the gym, gaming,dating..etc Keep yourself busy. Also having the right type of diet helps.   Doesn't matter what theme it is. if you keep working on yourself  for improvement you will eventually get there.Therapy is just there to provide you with the tools. The rest is up to you. Even if the thoughts bother you. Just let them float and keep looking forward."
"Do not compare your experience to someone else’s. Matt Haig’s book is brilliant but my experience was totally different to his. You have to try, if possible, to separate your experience. Everyone’s problems are subjective to them. Don’t be afraid of at least trying to seek help if you think you need it.  I avoided getting help for the longest time until my minor issues turned into major ones.  You’ve made a great step in at least trying to get help for how you’re feeling. "
"If you correctly blocked them, you won’t see any of their posts or comments. If you still are seeing them, make sure you’ve actually blocked them. If you want to talk about kittens, stick to those boards and choose not to engage with people not talking about kittens, and quit feeding trolls. Not trying to be harsh, but you have obviously been baiting this person which, no matter how awful they are, isn’t helpful. 

I hope you have fun talking about kittens, which are awesome. :)"
"I’m no pro but sounds like anxiety and maybe slight paranoia. Might be OCD, might not. I definitely recommend seeing a psychologist for testing. Check out Psychology Today to find one in your area that meets your needs. Don’t convince yourself that you have a disorder just because Dr. Google and WebMD said “Lookie here.” Be absolutely honest with what’s going on and your daily behaviours/thoughts during a psych appointment; honesty is crucial when it comes to mental health. "
"Not at all.  My high school biology teacher explained it this way. He said that in the elephant seal population, 20% of the males are responsible for copulating with 80% of the female elephant seals.  They are really busy guys!   That means that the other 80% of the other male, elephant seals are really bad dancers.

The other statistic he threw out was this one.  50% of all human males, will raise someone else's kids.

So do you want to be a male elephant seal or a male human being? "
"I broke up with my gf who I was codependent with about 6 months ago. Being alone has seriously sucked sometimes, but I think the important part is to not date just because you feel lonely. We gotta push through the bad times. If you want to be alone to prove to yourself that you can survive alone, that's ok. But I don't think it's necessary. Some people just prefer to be in relationships. The important parts here are being in a healthy non-codependent relationship and again not going into a relationship just because you're lonely.

Btw I'm no expert. This is just what I've figured from my experience. Take all internet advice with a grain of salt. Some people love to talk like they are omnipotent when they're really speaking on opinion."
"I was stuck in the house agoraphobic for about 2 years. 

Exposure therapy and medication compliance are your friends. 

Exposure sucks, it'll make you panic and make you feel worse, you'll have days you don't feel strong enough. You have to be kind to yourself on those days. You can't be making forward progress all the time. You need rest too.

For me, medication compliance wasn't too hard but since going into remission (almost no panic attacks in a couple of years now) I've come off two of the four medications I was on (with the help of my MH team.)

These days it's all about managing my moods and expectations. I know how to take care of myself much better and when stress is getting too much I get on top of things before they spiral."
"If your friend has high functioning autism, this is kinda par the course. A lot of people with autism struggle with understanding social norms and boundaries. They also struggle with empathy. There's nothing wrong with this, but it takes some getting used to.

Also, it sounds like your friend is also using his autism as an excuse not to learn. People with autism struggle with social norms, but it's not like they're incapable of learning them. He seems like he doesn't really see a reason to learn and grow, which kinda just makes him a jerk.

It's up to you to decide whether you want to put up with his behaviors. You can't change him if he doesn't want to change. But you can change your responses so that at least YOU have peace of mind. "
"I’m so sorry to hear. I’ve been through this myself and it is ever so challenging, however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and one day you will look back and understand why this has happened - I believe everything happens for a reason and one day you will be with someone who loves you so much it will all make sense why this has happened. Good things fall apart so better things can come together &lt;3 separation anxiety is a b*tch but use this time to focus on yourself and learn to enjoy your own company - go to the gym, spend a lot of time with supportive friends, practise meditation. One day this will all be a memory which will shape you and make you stronger. If you need a chat, feel free to message you. Lots of love x"
"(I am not a doctor and don't know anything about your medication, so this is just general advice based on my own experience.)

Doctors never agree, because mental health is kind of a grey area and it's just about finding what works and then doing it. Your first doctor thinks ""Patient seems fine now, so lets lessen the medication so they don't have to take it for life"" and your second doctor thinks ""Okay the patient seems fine so lets not change ANYTHING""

The first one probably should have explained the risks of being medication-free a little better, because it does mean there is a risk of another breakdown **if** the medication was the only thing keeping you stable.

The second one needs to realise that you're already below the therapeutic level, so changing it to be even less at this point is very low-risk. They should also have acknowledged that even if you kept taking the medication for life, that won't necessarily prevent you having another breakdown.

So, what it comes down to is what do you want? If it's not something you want to continue taking, then continue weaning off it. If your new doctor won't help, go back to the old doctor or find another new doctor.

Either way, it is possible you may need to take it or another medication again one day, but that doesn't mean for sure that you need to be taking it right now. And, I mean, if you stop taking it and immediately have another breakdown, it will suck, but at least then you'll know it was necessary and you can just take it again."
"i find this disrespectful even when my male friends say it to random women, it’s really demeaning (fyi i’m not a raging feminist). if my boyfriend said “i’d fuck her” to me i’d go fucking mental, it’s really inconsiderate on your behalf and quite frankly it’s disrespectful in every way possible. if he carries on EVEN after you’ve explained calmly how it makes you feel and he STILL does it, then personally i’d give him a taste of his own medicine, you see a fit guy on tv (he doesn’t even have to be that good looking) outright be like “crikey look at him, i’d have a go on that” or whatever, be creative haha. also whenever he says it you can just use the classic “doubt she’d feel the same about you mate” because truthfully, the men that usually say they’d fuck someone is way over their head and this woman they’re talking about wouldn’t even give them the time of day. do whatever you can in your power to get him to stop even if it means losing your temper big time, personally i would not tolerate this kind of behaviour from a partner, to some it may seem silly but to me it’s beyond disrespectful. imagine, he feels comfortable enough around his WIFE to announce he’d happily fuck another woman then god knows what he’d say when you’re not there to his mates or whatever, and if he has no consideration or respect for your feelings and boils everything down to “you can’t control me” then he’s extremely immature and selfish, he needs checking. "
"Could she have something like Autism? She is mimicking you, and I think there might actually be a word for that too. You need to find space for yourself and get her out of your hair sooner than later to save your sanity. Good luck. :)"
"Dear OP, I am so glad  that you are still here to encourage others not to give up. And to all of you who have commented on your past attempts I am so happy that you decided life is worth living. Wishing all of you the very best.��"
"Do you have an Adult Protective Service in your area? That might be a good place to start. They have some resources that they can point you toward and they might know exactly how to go about this.

Good luck to your mom and to you. :)"
Have you considered talking to your Mum to discuss how she treats him generally. Maybe giving some constructive feedback on how she could best improve? I appreciate some people don't react well to this sort of thing but it might help.
"I believe there are newer more desirable meds out there. If it’s not managing depression, even if not originally intended for that, you could speak to your dr about a change in therapeutic dose or a cross taper to a different SSRI. "
"I mean ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic. So if you've used it recently it might be that. In any event, bringing it up to your therapist and doctor is a good idea as there are many things it could be (including physical maladies)."
I’ve felt this way before too. Like I don’t want to go the rest of my life doing the same repetitive shit over and over again. And then a bunch of nihilistic shit on top of that. I’m gay too but white. Please feel free to PM me.
"Just because one doctor said it, doesn't mean it's true. I think you should get a couple of more opinions, perhaps from a doctor who focuses on maladaptive symptoms, rather than giving you a label that you will have to carry forever. "
"Thank you. I’m happy for you, too.

My doctor also prescribed me an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication. I’m hoping that the meds and therapy together will help.

Good luck with your treatment. I hope you feel better soon!"
"Yeah, it's like I'm doing something I made before, exactly the same thing, but you don't remember you've done it once you're finished with the action. And I don't know if I'm dreamy, but I can't tell difference from dream and reality."
You just gotta show him tough love if you start getting even more worried about him. That's all you can really do. He needs to know that he's loved. But he also needs to know that getting help is nothing to be ashamed of if necessary.

"I did indeed have a good time, it's just in the back of my mind. But I do believe pushing myself to admit that and say it openly (even if only to strangers) is a good first step. I know I need to change the way I think and make it so that kind of memory is okay, not a bad thing to hide from. But instead a moment to grow from and realise I am better off trying and enjoying myself than being too scared to even try.

Besides everyone looks silly now and again no matter what. Baby steps :)"
"I know your therapists outlook is obviously more high priority than some Guy in therapy on reddit, but even in that case I feel it's somewhat of a top-down characterization of what you do. Self moderation can be a component in quick and effective communication. I realize quick and effective has its merits and downsides too, but the implied idea that your whole vibe and personality lacks authenticity, to me might reflect a level of self-righteous ideology from the individual themselves."
"Meditation, working out and medication work for me. These 3 things are the only reason I'm even functioning enough to succeed.

Honestly though it hasn't gone away. My mind still races and usually goes to bad things but it's become manageable to the point of not doing stupid things as a result of it.

Also, in class almost nothing sticks. Taking online classes help a lot but when that's not an option I just do the work outside of school with youtube videos or tutoring where its 1 on 1."
"Right, but if people with adhd were educated on these things, just like people  know to brush their teeth every morning, then people with adhd would become more aware. Things like blurting something out - impulsivity can all be controlled if taught early. The only reason why they don't get taught early is because society is constructed by people that dont fully understand the implications of ADHD. There are jobs that specifically require traits that people with ADHD bring to the table."
"Thanks, I really appreciate your sentiment, and thank you for you kind words :)  


I hope in some small way this can go to help someone else out, because the worst part about it for me has been not knowing what it was and why it was happening for so many years. If there are others out there that are in the same boat, maybe if they come across this it'll give them the same lifeline I received.  


Because I really wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I did on their own as well."
"The bad one goes away on lexapro for me but when the drugs wear off its instantly back and worse, like its been just repressed abd built up, waiting to come back and fill me in on all the bad thoughts i missed while on the drug. I feel like its aware im trying to get rid of it and fights me when i do things to stop it. The worst was when i was at the doctor to get meds again and i felt tge most intense feeling that i was being chased. Like i had to get out of there or id get attacked. "
"Yeah I've been told many times by people that I am not this or that. I've spent most of my life learning to hide these things and have got pretty good at it, so it is somewhat frustrating when people make surface judgements and presume to tell me what isn't wrong with me.

Generally I don't let it get to me because the people that do understand don't need any explanation.

Luckily so far I haven't had this kind of attitude from healthcare professionals, only from friends/acquaintances."
"You need to cut off contact with anybody who's treating you badly. If somebody doesn't respect you then they're not worth your time. Don't be a doormat. Stop stressing over whether or not people like you. If you're constantly worried about others, you'll always be miserable. Your worth isn't based on other people's perception of you. It's based on your own. And the only way people will ever value you, is if you value yourself. Get those people out of your head and learn to enjoy life. "
"You see I’m in a really weird situation. I don’t really want to live forever, and I don’t want to die.

The only way I would want to live forever is if we were sort of stuck in the same time period forever.

So perhaps a mental simulation would be cool.
Give me the ability to live forever with only pleasure and never get bored of anything that might be neat.

In the end I sort of with I was never born. It just seems easier. Not really any point in this break from none existence. "
"&gt; Believing a woman should be allowed to consent to sex, have access to birth control, and be paid an equivalent wage as a male of the same qualifications makes me an extremist? 

yeah all of those positions are extremist.

consent is a bullshit concept. birth control is almost as bad as abortion. and women get paid less for obvious reasons, there should be no equality.

the only way i can eventually come to terms with what happened to me is to accept responsibility for my role, my actions. i was old enough to know better. i was a teen, a minor but not a child. the feminist bullshit narrative would have be blame everyone else but myself. blame my parents, blame the elders, blame everyone but the whore who is actually responsible: me."
"I've been seeing a few psychiatrists over the years, but have yet to find one that would really sit and listen to me. Typically, when I'd voice my opinion that a medication wasn't helping, they would just keep increasing my antidepressant dosage to the point I felt like a depressed zombie. My former therapist wasn't covered by my new insurance which is such  shame because she was a huge support over the years. For a while I'd bring up my suspicion of BPD, but she firmly believed that wasn't the problem. I don't believe I fit the criteria either. I had to stop seeing her before my suspicions of bipolar surfaced as I had never experienced a manic episode prior to 2017/2018. Now I'm starting over again with my mental health team \*sighs\*."
"I've heard from male friends too that they sometimes prefer masturbating over sex with their gf's. It's just nice to change it up a bit sometimes. I think this is pretty normal? Try not to take it as a personal rejection as it most likely doesn't have anything to do with you. He could have done this with other girls he was seeing as well, if that helps.   
I'm all for privacy as well, but ""texting with his back facing the wall"" sounds a little extreme. He does this on purpose so you can't see what is going on or just because he's comfortable sitting and texting that way?   
It sounds like you want a lot more reassurance than he is able to give to you at this time.   
do you personally feel like this is currently a healthy relationship? "

"You seem to be laboring under the assumption that I ever asked you anything.  I did not.  

Your supposedly anonymous survey is poorly and ambiguously worded and asks for enough bizarrely specific items--along the lines of: the first letter of mother's maiden name, first letter of the city where I was born, year I got my driver's license, etc.--that it pings my bullshit detector.

That is all.

Do kindly shut up now.

**EDIT:** And before you chime in to say it doesn't specifically ask for anything in that list of examples, please pay attention to ""along the lines of.""  I'm not about to go back to your phishing scam to get the exact wording of all your questions that make it sound like a phishing scam.  You don't matter enough for that."
"I joined reddit immediately after betterhelp denied me, after being denied by a real life therapist who told me she ""simply didn't know how to help"" (I've exhausted local resources at this point, she was an hour drive away). I struggle to talk verbally with other people, between speech issues, poor social skill, and anxiety it's very difficult for me; so I was looking into online therapy to be able to actually communicate with someone. Mention you're suicidal and now all these resources made for ""depressed people like you!"" suddenly can't help. Where are those of us who keep getting denied for help supposed to go to get help then? I'm not in a crisis, I don't need to be locked in a psych hospital (and I have been), I just need a therapist that's willing to listen and won't run away once they hear 'suicide'.

My heart goes out to you OP, I wish better days for you &lt;3 and better days to all the people who have been denied by betterhelp and have to see their snarky ads all over the web. "
"This may or may not help but I used (still do sometimes) to have super bad health anxiety and was terrified of dying. Someone told me I’m wasting my life worrying about dying. Basically you’re missing out on the very thing you are scared of losing. They were right. As for nightly panic attacks I can definitely relate. The only thing I haven’t tried yet is a weighted blanket, which I just ordered. I hope it helps, maybe it would help you too. I got a hypnosis app that helps too. 

I   also have to fight my brain constantly. It is exhausting. But it’s the only way to get by. I have to keep telling myself that negativity feeds on negativity, and the opposite is also true. I know it is much harder for people like us to stay positive. Something that helps me is watching videos of people dealing with something terrible in a really positive way. I might have to watch a lot of those just to make it through the day but it does help. I really feel for you because I know exactly how it is. "
"My god. This was something I needed. I've been told by everyone around me that I just need to ""suck it up and deal with it because how else will you feed yourself you don't wanna starve"".
You're right. A lot of my problems come from school but it's not for the obvious reasons. I have A+'s in all my subjects and A's in two...  Grades arent the problem. It's just that I'm being told to improve even more, which is nice. But I do have my limits. I try to be as happy as I can at home and school, so no one sees me whining like a pathetic teenager because I'm better than that. I have much more to endure. But it gets too much sometimes.
You're honestly the first person to tell me to ""fuck it and prioritize myself"" and I feel so grateful I don't think I have words to explain. 
I'm basically emotionally responsible for my family, some close friends and myself. I listen to everyone and try to soothe their pain but keep my mouth shut because no one here understands. Living in South Asia surrounded where mental health is stigmatized sucks. 
However your words really touched me. I'll try my best to follow your advices, learn not to give a fuck sometimes and follow my dreams...  When I actually have set some, that is. 
you're amazing. 
Thanks a million "
"I second EVO-Atticus. I also have severe anxiety which manifests in panic attacks. The genesis for mine is a fear of death, but one of the ways it manifests itself is similar to yours. Learning about the earth, our solar system our galaxy, far away galaxies, just how big space really is. I know we are important to people in our lives, but I’ve always wondered to, in the grand scheme of things, how important are we really? The truth I’ve come to realize is, we aren’t. But, I’ve also come to realize, that’s ok. Because it’s simply out of my control. I can’t force you to believe that, but my advice would be, keep learning, keep searching and keep questioning. Will it lead you into panic attacks and anxiety? At times yes, it has for me as well. But also think about this. Have you ha down if attacks before? Yes you have. Are you still alive and breathing on the other side of that? Also yes. Realize that going through those moments of fear and anxiety will eventually help you. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but eventually. It took me over 2 years, but eventually I found my why. Why do I wake up each day. Why do I recover from a panic attack and carry on like nothing is wrong? Find your why and you’ll start to find things any get easier. I too still have anxiety and panic attacks, over the same things. Not for the same reasons each time, because with help I’ve gotten better at confronting my fears and addressing them, but it isn’t easy. Have a “why” and a reason to believe and carry you through is meaningful to me. I hope it can be for you too. 

I honestly think you may be experiencing a lot of the exact same mental blocks I do. If you need someone to talk to in the future, feel free to PM me. I’d be happy to try my best."
"Horny, I suggest you see a psychologist and ask whether you have moderate to strong traits of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  One reason I mention this is because a person exhibiting strong bipolar-1 behavior in the past year has a 50% chance of also suffering from co-occurring BPD.  It therefore is common for these two disorders to be comorbid.

The second reason I mention the BPD possibility is that, in adults, cutting is strongly associated with BPD.  Indeed, of the 157 mental disorders listed in DSM-5, BPD is the only one for which "" Self-harming behavior such as cutting"" is listed as a defining symptom.

A third reason I mention BPD is that it might explain why your ""coping skills are shit.""  If you actually do exhibit strong BPD symptoms, you lack of number of coping skills that you had no opportunity to learn in early childhood (probably due to a trauma or inherited over-sensitivity to stress).  

In that case, you would need to learn, e.g., how to do self soothing, how to better regulate your emotions, how to avoid black-white thinking by tolerating  strong mixed feelings, how to trust, how to intellectually challenge  intense feelings instead of accepting them as self-evident ""facts,"" and  how to stay aware of the present instead of escaping through daydreams  into the past and future.  

Absent those coping skills, you would continue to  rely on the primitive ego defenses:  projection,  denial, temper tantrums, magical thinking, and black-white thinking. The good news is that, if you really have strong BPD traits, most major cities in advanced countries  offer excellent therapy programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that teach people  how to acquire these very skills. 

I caution  that BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person  either   ""has""  or ""doesn't have.""    Instead, it is a spectrum disorder,  which   means  every adult on  the   planet occasionally exhibits all  BPD   traits  to some degree.   At issue, then, is  not  whether you exhibit BPD traits.  Of course you do.  We  all  do.   

Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong  and persistent   level (i.e., are on the upper third of the BPD spectrum).   A psychologist or psychiatrist can help you answer that question. 

&amp;#x200B;"
Also things like people asking me personal questions sets my anxiety off and I need to know why they're asking and what they wanna do with that info. If I go outside I feel like I'm gonna be jumped or arrested for something I didn't do

"Eh, I was in the same situation. Long story short I had a fuckton of emotional / psychologic issues and my brain was altering my reaction to outside events. Both my grand-parents died in the past year, and seeking therapy helped a lot."
I can't tell you for sure honestly. But you're not the only one who's ever been attracted to a woman that's much older than you. I know that I have. You're going to have to bring this up to your therapist to get a better understanding.

"I have hung out with them on occasion, but there was always some barrier of professionalism...

I totally get this. I went from 2 years of unemployment (due to mental health) to a full time job. Reqlly struggled. 3 months in I ask for part time hours and got flat out denied despite appeals. Had I leave so I'm back to square one.
In what aspect ? There is no culture of diagnosing mental histories where I am from - so no idea if any of them suffered from anything specific. Nothing that I could see. What common things did you notice among these friends of yours ?
"Okay, I’ll do those things. I’m a woman by the way, and can share my feelings rather easily, but the situation I’m in right now is so stressful and I feel so overwhelmed that I’m doing everything I can to avoid it emotionally. "
"Sounds like a defense mechanism from abuse in your past. I do the same sometimes...I totally numb out. I don't feel, I don't see anything around me (but I do see it at the same time), I just go into total ""robot"" mode. \*sending hugs\*"
"Thank you thank you, this makes me feel so much more better about myself and the situation. 

My boss was understanding, she brought me orange juice and offered to get me something to eat and wouldn't let me leave until I calmed down. "
Thanks for this. You are very kind. I have tried to speak to a counsellor about this but she said I was fine after 8 sessions. I should probably go back but my health insurance only allows the 8 sessions. I just wish I could be happy.
"You can try mindfulness excercises, they tend to bring me back for a bit and I believe that over the course of time the bits might be longer. 
Also I endorse the previous comment, in particular the part about anxiety and caffeine haha."
"You’re unbelievably kind and worth it too. Seriously, this response means more than I can express through text. Thank you for being an incredible person. My messages are always open if you need to talk as well. Seriously, thank you. "
"&gt; how the computer does the maths I do not know

Which brings us back to how you need to take an introductory statistics course.

&gt; that does not mean I don't know how to interpret the numbers it comes out with

If you don't know how it generates those numbers, then yes it does.

&gt; you're clearly getting joy out of looking stupid

I'm not the one who admitted to plagiarism, doesn't know how the magic box makes the pretty numbers, or calls people stupid here.  That would be you."
"&gt;Positive pulls in positive energy. Negative pulls in negative energy.

I'm glad we can all agree that trauma victims and people with life-destroying mental defects or unconsolable grief after losing a child were baaaaasically asking for it with their ""negativity"".  

I think this is awesome advice for, say, childhood abuse victims who carry those scars into adulthood.  If only they had been less impure and shitty,  maybe they wouldn't have attracted the abuser...

Eye roll, forever."
"Definitely sounds like you're getting sensory overload and/or dissociating. I would talk to a therapist and look into mindfulness meditation. There should be YouTube videos online to try. It's about reconnecting yourself with your body and your space in time. It helps me when I start dissociating and when I have anxiety attacks.

Meditation sounds silly, but it can ground you when you feel like you're not entirely present."
"Its not a sign of mental illness but more like the sign of the times. There are outward facing  cameras on several houses where I live.  Its a  little too ""Handmaid's Tale"" for me.  I too, am a little nervous about where all this technology is leading us. 

For a real eye opening book, read [Rise of the Robots](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Robots-Technology-Threat-Jobless/dp/0465097537/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1536959943&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rise+of+the+robots).  This is not sci-fi."
"Were you high on hash or weed? (Being serious) 
THC revealed alot of things for me. What youre writing is an over analysis of how you act in society and how your thought process works, almost as if youre a spectator and not alive ( or dissociated), usually caused by anxiety. Im guessing youre an intelligent person with a lot of analytical thinking when it comes to human interaction and consciousness. You need to get out of your head, vent those amazing skills on the outside.
Good-luck  "
"You’re not a bad person for it, but it might be worth giving him a chance. It seems like he’s trying. Perhaps suggest something you like to do when he tries to see you. You don’t need to commit to much, he’ll likely just be happy you’re willing to do something with him. If it turns out he isn’t good for your mental health, then you have every right to distance yourself from him, and you still have that right now, but I think it’s worth it to let him try before doing that. "
"Drug use can actually bring about depression because your body adapts to the overload of serotonin and your baseline of happiness is moved too far up (requires more stimulants.)

The best way to try and get yourself back on track to happiness is to understand that you deserve to be happy and calm. The only way to accomplish that is by stopping the use of drugs. Everything they give you will be taken away many times over. Sometimes the answer may seem like to continue to use drugs, but you’ll need to understand that you have to live with the consequences of using them. Taking all that in together means we realize that using drugs isn’t worth it. You’re worth it.

Tell yourself you deserve to be calm and happy. The rest will follow. "
"Getting diagnosed was really the best thing for me. You can start to notice certain behaviours of yours and figure out your triggers and from this you can finally start working on your mental health effectively. Recovery might be harder, it might take longer, but you will get there. Many people say it lessens with age as well.

Personally for me, having ongoing counselling (2-4 times a month) with someone who’s trained to work with borderlines,being on anti depressants and getting sober worked wonders for me. I still sometimes have outbursts when I’m really pressed by someone, but handling my reactions and emotional responses to things has become x1000 ones better. 

I really hope this diagnosis is the best thing for your reconvert x"
"I have a blog where I document my problems, a book that is called ""what I have to be thankful for"" or something, which I write one thing each day I'm grateful for, some uplifting reading books, an uplifting music playlist. I find that exercising is really helpful if you can find the energy to do it, it really pays off. Anything like swimming, cycling, jogging, going to the gym etc. Also shopping can be therapeutic but not if you spend too much cause you end up feeling guilty. But treat yourself every now and again and maybe even tell yourself you will treat yourself if you reach certain goals. Also speaking to friends, family, or a professional can really help. 

I've been where you are, am still there... but those little things help :) "
"I'm sorry I can't offer advice. I just wanted to share my experiences. I liked reading your post, not because I want you to feel that way, more because I don't see many posts about employment and mental health problems when I know it's something I've really struggled with and it's the main thing that bothers me (let's face it - being out of work isn't good for mental health either!)

Fingers crossed for you. You don't know until you've gone full time. One thing I will say - ride it out for a bit. You may find it super hard at first and may even start thinking ""I was right"" in the first week or so but force yourself to give it longer, at least a month, to see if you settle into it and get used to it. It's easy to draw conclusions early on"
"You know, just a couple sessions of therapy would probably help you sort all this out. I also think many, many people have been affected if you reached out. 

But here's what I read recently from a psychologist. He had a patient come in who said, ""I think I've been raped."" and talked about how she would go out, get drunk, and be taken advantage of, but continue to do it. 

He said he had a few choices. He could say, ""Yes, you've been raped, and here are the resources to help you with support and safety and you should feel like a survivor."" and she might be able to heal. 

Or, he could say, ""No, you're being irresponsible and it's time to deal with why you feel like this."" and she could feel more mature and strong. 

Either one of those might heal her, or they might not. But his point was, he wasn't going to say any of those things, because they would influence her story. 

And it's all about the stories we tell ourselves. Our memories are there to serve us lessons. 

So sure, your story could be about being psychologically abused, or, your story could be about how you heroically escaped this situation, and are actually quite fine, with a few issues that many of us have, and you're going to be just fine. 

I feel bad about the insane private school I went to as a kid, and I know it had a big effect on me. But I'm best friends with some of the other kids, and all we can do is laugh it off and do our best. 

Good luck in whatever route you choose to go, I care about you and wish you the best. "

Alienation and lack of self-determination can't be fixed by prescribing SSRI's or valium. We are treating this as a problem of defective individuals so we don't have to face the hard truths about the system that creates this situation.

"Everyone grieves in their own way, and not everybody cries. Everyone has different triggers, and it sounds like personal stress is more triggering than death. And that’s perfectly fine. You just probably have different views on death."
Gotcha. I don’t know much about BPD but I wish people treated you with more respect. I hope we can find that somebody that can help us. Honestly I wish I lived back home in California because everyone is much more understanding there.
"I once hallucinated a lawn mower sound for 6 hours. From midnight to 6am. My brain obvi didn’t want me to sleep.

That also makes a lot of sense. I actually just made a chart to separate this belief between anxiety and psychosis and it’s filling more on the psychosis section. Mainly because the belief still is there even in the face of evidence.
"That's true, I'm trying to find resources for general information about psychology and psychiatric treatment today from a consumer's perspective. If you don't know that's ok, thanks for reminding me of something basic I'm pretty stupid."
"Then I would say defiantly go and talk to a professional. I have no qualifications to say anything but it rings with the idea of body dysmorphia. But I really don't know, defiantly sounds like something to talk to a professional about. "
When do you see your psychiatrist next? Definitely bring this up to them. Sleeping 39 out of 48 hours makes it just impossible to function. That would not be an acceptable side effect for me. Maybe you can switch to something different.
"Yeah I don't feel depressed or anxious so anything like that, I just don't like feeling out of it. I just feel like I can't work to my best ability and that I'm not motivated to do things because I'm not able to focus enough to do them."

"Being mean doesn't make me feel good, no matter who it is, but I understand. I'm a Buddhist, so the ideal is to try not to be angry even at people sawing your limbs off (actual example from scripture.)

There is a place for defending the defenseless or defending yourself, but I don't have the stomach for it."
"Healthy, happy people don't usually ask if they are depressed. I don't like to associate the word lazy with mental illnesses. Mental illness can cripple someone's ability to even brush their teeth every morning. If you have been eating normally, not under or over sleeping, and have been concentrating properly you most likely are not depressed to a large degree, and could be persistent depressive disorder. If I knew more, I would give you more insight. It might help to see a psychologist."
"I can only speak about my personal experience, I believe I was depressed which happened while I was in a relationship and I definitely still loved my now ex-boyfriend at the time and still wanted to kiss him, however yeah I wasn’t ever really in the mood for sex but I’m not the kind of person who does want sex a lot. However, having a mental health issue can put a strain on the relationship and it was one of the things that broke up my last relationship (it wasn’t the only factor)."
"Hypomania only last from 4 to 7 days if this periods passes and it hasn't calmed a little stop the medication, also if your financial status is at risk stop it and visit your doctor.

Antidepressants only change the thought process easier for you it will not make you happy. The sleep pattern could be your body's way of adjusting to intense exercise which i recommend you to tone it done a little. Melatonin helps a lot in the regulation and maintenance of sleep since you seem like you need more sleep go to Walgreens and buy the melatonin 10mg extended release (trust me it helps a lot) but you need to stop using tv, phone, laptop, etc anything with a screen since melatonin works through the eyes and blue light destroys the melatonin hormone."
"I'm afraid I disagree with you on this one. OCD is perhaps the most widely misunderstood mental health issue. So few people have any idea what it is. It has been repeatedly described by TV shows etc. as being very anal and nothing else.

Sounds like OP's boss is among the majority who just don't know any better.

Speaking as somebody who apparently has OCD (still working on a diagnosis but this is what they tell me so far), I wouldn't be offended if somebody reacted this way to me. Frustrated, sure, but I would just try to explain exactly what it is and what it does to me. If they still choose to be ignorant then sure, forget about them. But you have to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially somebody from a different generation."
"if you're aggressive maybe some fighting sport or weight lifting can be good. i hate team sports and other people, so i picked lifting. can just let the beast out in the gym. getting stronger and bigger is a good feeling. 

i'm more than 10 yrs older than you though and i don't have much else. i wouldn't have convinced myself if someone told me this either, lol. but i feel like it's good to be honest next to douchy older people who always say it gets better. not without making radical changes in your life it doesn't. 

i wish someone told me when i was 15 that life really is shit, people and governments are corrupt and it's all pointless. maybe i could've skipped the whole ""mr nice guy"" act i had going on in my late teens/early twenties. "
"oh oops! sorry i misunderstood the initial post then. Ya, i think sometimes we have a tendency to want to ""fix things"" when a loved one is grieving. but i think the best description of grief that i've ever heard is, ""grief is just love with nowhere to go,"" and none of us have the ability to take away that pain. Just be there for him when he needs you, and that's the best you can do.

I can tell that you put your heart and soul into the people you care about.The grief that your partner is experiencing might be making it difficult for him to see what a toll it's taking on you though, but I bet he wouldn't want ya this exhausted/drained because of what's going on for him. Rest up so you can love even harder once you're back to baseline &lt;3"
"Hey,

What I am seeing here (also by your strong defiance as responses to comments that say to just push though) is that you already know this is not sustainable to keep living there and you actually want someone to repeat it back to you. It is very responsible of you to think about money, however you don't have to. You really don't. You really should call home and say what you posted here. That's hard, but being 17 people will have to sympatise bc they remember how vulnerable they were themselves at that age (and if they don't they are just assholes). The great thing about calling is that there do not need to be made decisions then and there.  I would really avoid a dramatic ""Hi mom, I need to go home, I hate it here, I'm packing my bag, will be on the first flight tomorrow"" so my advice is take your time with making decisions and explain mainly what's bothering you. If you take a less dramatic approach people will take you more seriously and if you explain more they will understand more."
"I cannot put as much of an effort into anything as you are right now in trying to help me. Not caring about anything or anyone makes everything so one sided. I've pretended to care my entire life but it's got to the point that I'm tired of pretending. You telling me that it may change makes me want to hold out but I think our situations are so far apart it may not apply to me. I don't get anxiety. I've felt depressed during traumatic events and abuse when I was a teenager but I haven't felt that way in a long time.  


I definitely have some PTSD but I just hold it all in. None of the events seem traumatic but I relive them in dreams, or certain things in life that trigger flashbacks, which always feel so much more traumatic than the events themselves felt at the time they happened. So maybe this is something to mention to the psychiatrist.   


Though this does not change my mind about the suicide, I may call back and see if I can get an appointment sooner. Thanks for your help, stranger."
"I went through a similar thing with my ex. I’ve been diagnosed with countless mental disorders on top of numerous physical health issues, and although my ex tried very hard to understand them and always insisted that they would never come between us, it definitely was a burden on him. I tried my best to keep everything to myself, but when we lived together it was difficult to manage all of my disorders and prevent them from taking a toll on his mental health as well. 

We did not break up to due my mental health, however, and it is more than possible for you guys to last and work well. 

Keep this in mind: Work together, not against each other. 

Really try to understand each other and communicate. Making plans ahead of time for potential triggers or crises are a good idea. Additionally, putting a plan in place for when you two have a fight would be productive. 

Sorry if this is confusing or difficult to follow - let me know if you need me to clarify anything or have any questions etc. "
"There's a lot you can do without medications. Some things proven to work are; meditation, 30 minutes of walking a day, yoga, exercise in general, eating enough dark leafy greens, eating a nutritious diet in general, avoiding alcohol and drugs, spending time with others, volunteering, etc. I didn't want to go on medication so I did all of these things religiously for 8 months before I'd let myself  start taking an antidepressant. While those things did help a lot I wish I had let myself start meds earlier because I truly need them but a part of me is glad I tried to do it without them because now I never have to wonder about it. Medication won't magically fix everything of course and my experience has been that I feel like my best self when I combine a healthy lifestyle with my meds. I can feel a real difference if I miss my walks or if I've been eating poorly even on my antidepressants. I think lifestyle changes are a great place to start but no one should feel bad if they need more help. "
"First off, kudos to you for taking this important first step in admitting a problem and calling for help, nothing wrong with that and everything right.  You have valid problems.

So it seems what you need to do is a give and take, first is the latter, you need to take away the harmful habits nominally for a coping purpose but are actually harmful.  For binging, put limits on money use, either actual withdrawal limits or a business card you hand out to kick you out if you come up to the till with junk food.  For purging, willpower is going to be at the forefront, but you can keep track of how many times you do, and try and go without for longer and longer.  

And as you have taken from yourself, so you must give.  Start small, but just go ""fuck it"" and head to the rec/community center for a gym and/or pool and start for the novelty.  Change a route to find some small bit of nature on the way to something, and/or start writing about how you feel.  The point is to change habits from negative to positive, you can't just take from yourself to ""not"" do X or Y because mental austerity usually backfires.

Remember, your life is YOUR life, at the end of the day you just have to go ""fuck you I'm alright"" to the world.  Not perfect, not horrid, but alright.  Want to be ditzy and bubby?  That's OK.  It's OK to be annoyed when that gets to be childish and dumb as well.  You don't have to answer to anyone more than yourself, so YOU get the ultimate choice in how to go about your life.

Keep on keeping on."
"Well with ADHD and similar disorders the prefrontal cortex of the brain (the part responsible for human's increased cognitive abilities) seems to be underdeveloped or under active. 

Some of the functioning of that part of the brain can be restored simply by taking ADHD medications. So in that sense we can already partially reverse some aspects of some intellectual disabilities. 

The hippocampus of many depressed people shrinks. That part of the brain is responsible for our memory, which is interesting because one of the symptoms of depression is impaired long term memory. And when patients are cured of depression the hippocampus returns to it's normal size over time and their memory improves to where it use to be(or close). 

Stimulant medications have a gradual effect of increasing intelligence slightly over time in ADHD patients. So some portion of our IQ is kind of ""built"" by our brain as we experience things. What happens here is the improvement in focus/attention from the medication allows the patient to learn more effectively, slowly improving IQ above where it would have been had the person not been medicated. 

I don't think it would be possible to reverse brain damage though. And I'd wager brain damage is involved to some degree with conditions like iron deficiency.

The best we can probably do is train the brain to make up for it's disabilities. That's pretty much what the stuff I mentioned above is doing. 

Btw, did that Ted talk happen to have anything to do with gene therapy? "
"Ok, Sorry for the way you feel about my comment. I can be very direct and I do so purposefully as I don't sugarcoat anything. I just go off what info people display. You stated you haven't had to deal with DID for 4 years but never gave a reason why not. Is it because you were actively taking meds and speaking to a therapist, as DID is treated by LONG-TERM psychotherapy. Did you stop seeing one? If so, Why? And if so, You know exactly who you need to talk to. Not Reddit. DID is quite rare, so all you'll get is opinions like mines here....As you can tell, i'm the only one who even bothered replying with any advice on the matter....Do with it what you will. I never said you were faking it, but you gave absolutely no reference to a therapist which was surprising given that they usually are a DID patients saving grace....As for your abandonment issues, I am assuming your friends are not suffering from mental illnesses currently? Are they fully on-board to coddling you and your 5 personalities as you switch back and forth at any given time? Are they immune to having their own feelings on your issues and live to make your day go as easy as possible? If not, then everything I said above still applies, as YOU are the one with the illness and issues...not them. They are effected just as much as you are by the way you act and/or respond to them. For you to expect them to just deal with your issues and not care about how they feel says more about you than it does them. And you should rightfully be concerned about them leaving you to...Which is probably why when you text them, you can't go a second without their reassurance that they are still there. I'll leave you alone and I hope someone else comments...as I would love to hear a different take on this."
"I’m bipolar and this is what I’d need you to know and how I’d need someone to handle me in this situation:

-Keep everyone safe. It isn’t your responsibility to handle him on your own. Don’t be afraid to call 911 if a situation is getting out of hand. Also call the police if he makes threats to anyone’s safety. 

-Get his medical team involved. You’re not trained to handle a high risk person. Make sure they know what’s going on. 

- Being confrontational with him runs the risk of his behavior escalating and results in a higher chance of him becoming violent. He’s not rational right now. Logical explanations aren’t going to work. In my experience the least confrontational way to talk to him is to try using his own logic to convince him. You can also completely avoid/deflect the subject (ie, I’d love for you to stay with me but my in laws just won’t leave). You somehow have to figure out how to set firm boundaries without outraging him. 

You might be able to say something more direct like “I’m worried about you for these reasons... Let’s talk to your doctor about what’s going on. I’m here for you but don’t feel comfortable having you around my family at this time.”  But don’t do this if you think it’s too dangerous. 

-Once he’s in a better mental state, talk to him about how he’d need support next time. This would be a better time for you to address the safety concerns. But remember, this is still a really sensitive subject. After a bad episode Im feeling guilty, embarrassed, worried my friends will leave me because they can’t handle it anymore. Validation that you’re still here for him and not mad helps. 

-Lastly it’s really great that you want to help him. I’d want my friends to step in during an episode.
At the same time, it’s absolutely not your responsibility to save him. Frankly it’s asking a lot of someone to know how to appropriately handle a manic episode. Rely on his doctors to manage this issue and keep your family safe.

"Well I've done different psychedelics in my heyday and I can definitely say that this is very different to that. It comes from a different 'place' entirely. What's happening at the technical level during an episode is a malfunction in the ability to properly integrate visual-spatial and somatosensory information in the TPO-C region of the brain.

The experience is essentially the internal subjective manifestation of a breakdown in the minds proper ability to integrate spacial temporal somatic visual etc information into a unified comprehension of reality. So everything becomes paradoxical, infinitely big and small, fast and slow, loud and quiet, soft and hard e.t.c. It becomes both at once and neither. It's very discombobulated and honestly, terrifying. The room doesn't go anywhere, things don't physically change, but your veritable *understanding* of how things fit together, and your core level *sense* of how things are, alters in an extremely difficult to handle and very dizzying and panic inducing way.

There's no merit to be had from the experience. It may seem awe-some as it were, and I appreciate that sentiment. but a better description for it would be *completely overwhelming,* not in any way that you could gain any value from it after the fact. It is very much like entering some kind of twisted hell dimension. The words I used to describe the situation are still not properly adequate to really represent what it's actually like to have an episode. But they are the closest I can manage at least to attempt to convey what it's like. The experience itself is, as with life, actually a fluid continuum of sense of self and surroundings, all-be-it one that shifts, during an episode, into an incredibly scary mode of being. My writing above attempts to describe that experience through description metaphor and allegory, but it is not those things.

I have through the years actually gone through many of those sophistic musings about what the nature of the experience must be coming from, and it's been, I suppose, daunting, to carry around those possibilities as to what's been happening to me (and something to which I've inevitably ended up cycling through the mental health system trying to answer, possible co-morbidity notwithstanding, but that's another story). So honestly it's been a massive saving grace to find out that it's as simple as a misfiring of certain areas of the brain. I'm ok with that, it's far easier to deal with than the kind of set up's I alluded to in my opening paragraph in the OP."
"As it turns out, a lot of people care about sex in relationships. Even if you tell them from the beginning that you're asexual and they are okay with it, at some point they start pushing and get frustrated. I guess that's just how it is."
"Done. I've been in his shoes. It makes me emotional, no matter who the person is. I am a big advocate of mental health awareness,  To write love on her arms. I always tell people, they may not know me, but they can talk to me. I do care."
"I can, more or less, relate. 

Also, be kind to yourself. From what you said, I wouldn’t guess that it’s a “discipline” issue. You don’t sound like you’re lazy. Most lazy people, I think, don’t give a shit about being lazy."

I'm no mental health expert but I'd point you in the direction of OCD. I know a lot of people say they have it but they're actually talking about something else. Over compulsion disorder I believe is what it stands for. You might have it

Maybe once he’s recovered take him to a suicide victim group sort of thing. Let him see the damage suicide causes to peoples loved ones and ask him if he’s really willing to inflict that much emotional pain to his family and friends.
Maybe you should hold off on having children if you’re suffering from mental health issues and pain. I got mental health problems myself. Better really think hard about if you can still be the best mother while having this infliction.
"Oh, so one having prerogative as you call it should according to you, prevent me from writing?

Wow, seems like we now know who's really prerogative here after all. Not me of course, I am just here writing my advice, dear useless critic."
"PhD in what?

Also, I don’t care what you say because if my quality of life has improved because I take a certain drug, you can’t convince me or anyone else that we shouldn’t be taking something that is CLEARLY improving our lives!"
"Simple answer is no, it’s not your own fault. Not at all. You Mum sounds like she’s got zero tolerance for you and just wants to make you feel bad about yourself. She’s still wrong though. No science on her behalf; just bitterness "
"Sorry to randomly come here &amp; ask something in addition, but I relate to OP's topic and wanted to know by anyone who knows lol how old do you have to be till your memories of such traumas as sexual abuse aren't removed by your brain?"
"Sounds like you’re just using marijuana to make you feel better about your life issues, but of course the “high” it gives you is just temporary. I can’t comment much further because you really did not mention any of your issues. "
"Thanks so much :) The stories have worried me a bit for my safety so it’s sensible I think. Maybe I should try and sleep early so he doesn’t deprive me of sleep as much. 

I’ll look into the laws. I might get some free legal advice"
"We went no contact. It's the most painful experience of my life, but gives her space which is the most important thing. Sometimes you need space to think without him contributing, you know? Then you can clean slate further down the line."
Would you be opposed to a low dose antipsychotic? I was having a difficult time about a year ago and was prescribed a low dose of seroquel and it’s changed my life. For the first time my mind was quiet and I felt a true sense of calm.
"I upvoted you, but never replied because I needed to think. I wanted to thank you for the advice. I searched out counseling specific only to my problems and spoke with their secretary. They take my insurance and said I didn't need a referral anymore. So I'm giving it another go. I will be sticking with my over the counter plan though.

I also saw my old counselors advertising elsewhere! They sound so good on paper, claiming they can handle problems like mine... Too many promises, I guess."
"I was in a very similar situation myself. For a long timenI would bottle up every emotion because my parents would always shame me for it. I.e. Don't have an attitude! or Why are you crying? Did someone die? 

You need to find someone to talk to. Not necessarily someone to find the answers, but just someone to vent to. You can message me if you want to talk or you could find a councilor in your area. However I can tell you that bottling it up will just lead to more problems down the road."
"I was on it for around 2 weeks and experienced hot flashes, auditory hallucinations, and maybe a few other things I cannot remember. 

If you haven’t been on it long I would say that it clearly is not the right medication for you and you should make an appointment with whomever prescribed it as soon as you can. (the sooner you get off of it the better ya know?) 

It took me about 5-6 different medications before I found the right combo, which coincidentally is the same as my father’s."
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

"I’m sorry and surprised you haven’t received a response to your post. Unfortunately, you are not capable of helping her if she is unwilling to help herself.  Have you told her you are concerned about growing more resentful? Perhaps if you frame it that to seek help is helping YOU cope in the relationship. Or try couple’s counseling with the intent of figuring out how to manage this together. Ultimately though, she needs to know that the survival of your relationship is in jeopardy. "
"So, I'm not sure if you're on any new drugs... but, black box warnings are definitely there for a reason. I was put on Prozac and everything seemed fine for a while and then all of a sudden I had those bouts of deep depression and severe anxiety, like you described, where I constantly wanted to kill myself. 

SO. If you're on new meds or recently changed the dose, that definitely might be the cause.

If not, maybe try yoga nidra? It's a form of meditation, somewhat like hypnosis I guess? "
There is no point trying to guess what is going on in his mind as you will never know. I also have a lot of difficulty not thinking about people. I have relapsed back into anorexia when 2 of my serious relationships ended because I just could not cope with the pain. Whenever we try not to think about something we end up thinking about it more so I would just let yourself think about him. Keep trying to do things you enjoy and live your life and hopefully one day the thoughts will lessen.
"Alright, that's good! Have you spoken about all this with your therapist? 

I know you'll probably get told this a lot, but your therapist is the best person to tackle these problems with. If you feel like your therapy or medication isn't helping, make sure they know that so they can take a different approach/put you on different medication if needed. You'll never be a bother to them, the way you're feeling is valid and any good mental health worker should never make you feel like it's not.

Make sure your friends and family know where your at as well, which I know can hard sometimes, I've been there. You're loved and people will be there if you need them to be. The good folks here on Reddit will be happy to talk to you as well, of course."
"Yes!!! Same here with ADHD. I noticed that there’s a lot of focus on kids that have it (which is great, don’t get me wrong) but it feels like there’s not as much support for adults as there is for kids. I usually see ADHD online as something that’s funny to have, which sometimes it can be when it’s harmless, but we do suffer also in reality.  Unfinished projects, losing things as soon as you put it down, forgetting things ALL THE TIME, hard time concentrating and focusing. All this makes it hard for us sometimes to get jobs or keep jobs if the ADHD is left untreated. Even small tasks like paying bills or doing laundry is a challenge itself. I wish it could get the same amount of “awareness” as all other mental health issues. "
"You do realize this is a mental health sub right? I'm not trying to be rude or imply that your issues (if you have them) aren't as bad. But overthinking is pretty common in a variety of mental illnesses. It's not voluntary trust me I wish and I guess most do that we could ignore them or stop them. 

I would like to add that for me personally having ADD It's something I do on hyperdrive. It's not a problem when their happy thoughts though, it's a nightmare when I have suicidal feelings. I literally play every bad memory over and over and over. And I have no way to stop it without medication. 

Once again I'm not trying to insult you or anything. I just hope that you realize that for some of us just ignoring or stopping them isn't an option."
"When you think about this, do you, even for a second, contemplate the damage it would do to the other person?  Do you think you do that, and the other person just gets up and walks away like it never happened? I really hope you're not thinking like that because it would be woefully myopic of you to not consider the immense harm that violating another person will do to their psyche.

Do you know what PTSD is? :

* Re-living the traumatic event through unwanted and recurring memories, flashbacks or vivid nightmares. There may be intense emotional or physical reactions when reminded of the event including sweating, [**heart palpitations**](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/heart-arrhythmias-and-palpitations) or [**panic**](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/panic-attack).
* Avoiding reminders of the event, such as thoughts, feelings, people, places, activities or situations that bring back memories of the event.
* Negative changes in feelings and thoughts, such as feeling angry, afraid, guilty, flat or numb, developing beliefs such as “I’m bad” or “The world’s unsafe”, and feeling cut off from others.
* Being overly alert or ‘wound up’ indicated by [**sleeping difficulties**](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/sleep), irritability, lack of concentration, becoming easily startled and constantly being on the lookout for signs of danger.

&amp;#x200B;

Add to that, possibilities of various types of anxiety and depression and you start to get a picture of what someone considering raping another human being is actually proposing to do to them. 

You're on a mental health sub, so I am thinking you may, yourself have symptoms of a mental illness?

If so, think about yourself and then add the symptoms above to what you have. Think about what that would be like, and then consider if you think raping someone would be an Ok thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

And get help. Please. Get help."
"Definitely got some general anxiety going on. Possibility of OCD but that's for a psychiatrist to determine based on more information. If all this is causing you distress, please seek professional help. It is possible to get some relief. "
"Doesn't your depression bother you though? I get what you're saying, you don't really know what it's like not to have it since you've had it so long, you don't know who you'd be without it. Have you done anything to help your depression? "
"Hang out here with me...this is my socialization. Sad, but true. I am a total social dumbass. I will talk to you...or you can just hang out and we can ponder the universe together...or ponder our bellybuttons. Whatever you like to do.  :D"
"I get that part.  I am with a therapist for my ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences) as well but I have no fascination with fire.  At least not yet. 

Just stay safe until you can uncover the root causes.  Again, I know nothing about this."
I know this is probably no help but I never lost the weight until I stopped taking the drugs. I would speak seriously to your psychiatrist about the concerns you have about the weight gain and they would have a better idea of what to do.
"I need to go to the doctor, as I think I do have this but I keep forgetting to sort out my doctor's where I have recently moved. 

What support is there when you are diagnosed? Does it make life easier knowing? Is there medication? 1-2-1?"
"I wouldn't pin this to OCD solely, like u/blurredgreyskies said, go and get a full evaluation and speak to professional because there seems to be something more prominent at play here, Good luck to you and please seek the help you need :)"
"Just as an example of how bad the guilt gets is that today for lunch at work I had a small packet of noodles and a mocha, I didn’t even have breakfast. I feel so bad for eating that, that for dinner all I’m having is a glass of water."
"Thank you. At least we're not alone in feeling this way. That is somewhat comforting, not that I would ever wish anyone to feel this, it just makes me feel less alone in a way.  I hope you are able to find a way to better times soon too. "
"Yes but a lot of the time I feel worse afterwards for not having gone to the thing. Sometimes you have to kick yourself in the pants, sometimes you have to listen to yourself and stay put. It's hard to choose which one is right sometimes."
"Yes i do believe mental illnesses are heavily romanticised. I believe that it is damaging, because it paints a false image of what it really is like to suffer from a mental illness. I feel miserable as fuck, and i'm so unbelievably tired."
"You can message me anytime if you need to talk. :)

I used to self-harm all the time, and it was always because I needed to feel \*SOMETHING\*. I was always numbed out, and it was scary. Good luck and I hope you find a new therapist soon!"

"could be a number of things but a lot of people struggle with prolonged eye contact, my mum for example she’s very outgoing and social but eye contact for more than like 6 seconds makes her uncomfortable. don’t worry about it too much"
"*You* are the one taking people down. You are taking them down by insulting them, piling on unnecessary guilt, and calling people sinners for having a disease.

You claim that you cannot hurt people with words, and yet you have also claimed in other threads that you were depressed because you lived with a mother who had depression.  Unless this is just your arrogance talking, that means you could not have developed depression from living with her because her words couldn't hurt you either."
A professional will help you figure that out. There are many different degrees and classifications for each “blanket” affective disorder diagnosis. The best thing I ever did was get REAL help and be totally honest and informed. Self-awareness is key and it sounds like you already have a lot of that. You can feel better with a support system and using your own personal strength that you already have inside. You are welcome. Best of luck. You can do it and it’ll feel freeing and great!
"Definitely talk to a professional. :) The US health system is more than fucked...it is a cluster fuck on top of a fucking mess. I only have coverage because I am disabled on Medicare/Medicaid and I have had mental issues my whole life so nobody questions my disabled status. :( 

I wish you luck though. Find some friends and maybe you can get your mind off things. &lt;3 Good luck. 

Oh, I am a woman and your post just touched my heart. I feel so bad for what you've gone through. Seriously. "
"I have Major Depressive Disorder and I actually was put in the hospital twice because I tried to kill myself. I kept having thoughts that nobody loved me (not true!) and that my family would be better off without me (NOT true). I wouldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, and I felt like I was in a constant dream-state. Everything didn't look real to me...and I felt like a ghost, just floating through my days. I don't have the mania part of that, though.  Just depression and anxiety. Hope that helps!"
"I live in a rural area with a GP and a LCSW. I don’t have insurance. With my anxiety I’ve had my entire life, things have been up and down, but lately down.

I’m pretty sure I have OCD with intrusive thoughts, etc. For immediate relief, what can I do when I start worrying?

For my trouble concentrating, low energy, poor sleep, what else can I do?

My main concerns are money for the bills, transportation (don’t have a car) and stigma...

Anyway, sorry I kinda hijacked the thread...."
"I suspect (I will be going to see my Psych next week) I have...Ugh. I can't write the name out. 

I start fires. Not large ones, but small, controlled fires. Several times a day. The urges are overwhelming, but I feel so much better once I light one. I can't stop myself a lot of the time, but when my family is around, I am able to control it. :( 

This causes much shame for me. I am glad we can talk though. There aren't any other people with a Mania here right now except you and myself. :("
"I think when you’ve lived the issues yourself it is a lot easier to understand and help people. I think having someone to talk to is sometimes all you need so if I can be that person then be me even better. 

I have a big heart and having quit my managerial job after 14 years last week I have had a lot more time to think. I may completely change vocation and start a career where I can help people. Thank you for the upvote and if you ever do feel like you need to talk please hit me up :) "
"It’s weird I know if I did these things my life could improve, but I keep seeing why I don’t do these things. Like, if I was honest with my parents a lot of repercussions would follow, makes my head hurt. Thanks for the advice though I’ll try to do it but you know most of the time we never listen. I think the reason a lot of people don’t heed internet advice is because the poster doesn’t
 give the full background so my fault as well, your advice though I could use the gist of it."
"I’m not an SJW. I don’t even call myself a feminist. What I said is absolutely true about how language is used in USA, and it isn’t useful to society. I assume you’re an adult, yes? Would you like to be referred to as a child? 

If I went around having the subconscious opinion that people near my own age were children then that speaks volumes to how I perceive my own capabilities and those around me. An issue that I think OP clearly has a either problem with or is concerned about. "
"I am so sorry you’re going through such a difficult time! I have felt like I needed to give up, too. I’m so glad I chose not to go that route. I promise you the universe is not telling you to give up. In fact, you’re here for a reason and the universe wouldn’t be the same without your existence. I really encourage you to tap into your heart space and give yourself the love you so deserve. This guy clearly has a lot of growing up to do and doesn’t deserve someone who cares as much as you do. If you feel like spending 15 minutes giving yourself some love, this is a great video. It’s not a workout and she says a lot of encouraging things. It’ll give your mind a little break.

"It’s definitely easy to feel that way. I think you just have to keep in mind it isn’t a competition, there doesn’t have to be a winner. I used to feel that all the time the smallest things would really set me off and bother me. I felt like I was so affected by everyone else. I would fixate on such irrelevant things.  Over time I just had to convince myself that there’s no need to be jealous, it doesn’t matter what everyone else has/is doing/etc. I will never be exactly like someone else so I can’t expect things to happen exactly the same for me. Definitely takes some convincing but you’ll get there. Try and realize when you’re doing it how unnecessary it is to compare yourself. Life isn’t a competition. Keep your head up! "
"Well his jokes are way too overly offensive. He makes jokes about race, gay people and people dying. I dont mind dark and offensive humour but his humour to me is just flat out horrible. He also says hes excepting of everyone but makes weird jokes or comments about people for being gay or a different coloured skin. Ive asked why hes like this because its something I dont agree with at all and he says not to take it seriously and he dousnt actually mind them. His 21 year old friend is also dating a 14 year old (She only just turned 14 this month) and I blocked his friend on my social media accounts and have been actively avoiding him and my boyfriend dousnt understand why I find this man so disgusting. Ive told him its wrong for his friend to be dating practically a child. He says love is love (Ironically enough from someone who makes nasty homophobic comments.) He was joking about how this young girl has sent nudes and done ""stuff"" in video calls for his friend and I was actually disgusted. "
"Things can get better.  However I think realistically it's better to look at it like it will never totally go away, but symptoms and things can and medications can help and coping skills and behavior modification.  I personally don't feel like it's a good idea to ever think you will be ""cured"" of a mental illness, but it will always be there.  The goal is to find tools to manage it and keep it as distant and in the background as possible.  The ideal is that you don't feel like you have a mental illness :)  

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, it sounds like a good idea you are in therapy.  It can be a long and tiring and hard process to find a therapist who works well with you.  Just keep that in mind, not every therapist is a good fit for everyone, so it can take some work to find someone who you click with and who is helpful.  I am sure you can talk to them about things you are feeling and dealing with and they can help lead you to someone who can properly diagnose (maybe you have BPD\[borderline personality disorder\], or depression etc).  

&amp;#x200B;

When things get too much for me, I have learned that I have to let things go and focus 100% on myself.  For you this might mean leaving the grad school program.  It might mean finding alternate ways to deal with so that you can stick in the program and get through while working on getting yourself better.  

&amp;#x200B;

Things can get better- just keep seeking help.  They only will stay this dark and sad if you give up and don't get help.  "
"I couldn't agree more and this is likely, for the overwhelmingly most part, accurate for most people making good money. The more money you make generally means the more you work. When I was making $3,000/month roughly 5 years ago, I had an easy life. Yes, I was depressed because my wife and I were only able to save $1,000/month (great compared to most people but still won't get us anywhere in the grand scheme of things). So my money situation sucked but my life was easy. I was able to take mental health days when I felt like it. I did things I enjoyed which made me much less depressed. In fact, the only thing that egged on my depression was my financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 5+ years. I am now making roughly $10,000/month after tax. I work at least 14 hours a day...every day except Saturday. But, I'm in the office for a few hours Saturday night. I have no life. None. I rarely see my wife and kids. I don't exercise anymore because I don't have time. I take one family vacation per year for 4-5 days (and it's not even a vacation because I'm checking in on work for 2-3 hours during those vacation days). My life is literal shit. From experience, let me tell you this: do NOT try to make more money if it means you will end up working like a dog. Most people who make this kind of money will NEED to work this hard in order to see financial success. It is just not worth it IMHO. Will I now then go back to making $3,000/month? Ah - great question. This is the problem. Once you make this kind of money, it is hard to go back to what you were making before, even with your mental health on the line. More importantly, if you have a family, you have a big responsibility. I am trying my best to give my kids the best (financial) life possible, even at the expense of my personal mental health. I know - it's a shit situation but I don't have a REALISTIC better alternative. I am stuck and this will be my life for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

Point is: forget financial success. It is good to grow financially, but don't try to double or triple your salary. Be happy with a 2-5% annual salary increase if you get it. And find a job that is 9-5 - where you can clock out at 5PM and not have to think about work until you walk in at 9AM the next day."
"I don’t and have never taken anxiety medication, 

But this has been happening to me every weekday for the past month or so. It’s tough because it creates negative thoughts to start the day. My issues are definitely work related though"
"I missed the thing where everyone got together to release balloons, but I had been considering that. I might just go out in the woods and build a bigass fire and dance around it like a crazy person. I think that would have made him smile. "
I skipped out on my last four therapy sessions and also have distanced myself from my friends. It's such an issue that I always have to tell people beforehand it's not personal. I know I'll get out of this but it just makes me so annoyed.
"I've always worried about the same thing. I don't want to be thrown in there only to have them ask me, ""So, whats your problem?"". I don't know what to answer when I get asked things like this. I need questions that are clear and precise..."
"Maybe, as long as I had proof that the third party wasn’t sharing data with company. And then there’s also the peer I’m paired up with. What happens if I express suicidal ideation? Will peer go share this info with my manager or HR? "
"Painting is the thing that lifts my mood the most. I'm not extremely artistic but even just throwing some paint on a canvas is incredibly healing for me. Also, getting active. It's harder to be anxious when you're out of breath from a jog."
That sounds like fun. I should definitely get a gun and try hitchhiking or train hopping and see where I end up. If I have the pills on hand I can just do it whenever I'm up for it. Maybe I'll wait for the pills then try that. Good advice.
"That's just insecurity and I'm sure it's something that will come up in your sessions. There's nothing wrong with seeing someone so close to you in age but if you're more comfortable with someone else, tell her that and ask for a referral."
"They told her that her 'Care plan' would be discussed on Monday for the week, so even though she only agreed to stay through Monday that's their way of indirectly saying she's going to be there for longer.  

Thanks for the advice, though."
Think about this way..most therapists are not good. 50% say.  Find someone that you personal feel comfortable with. Follow your gut. You should walk out feeling trust and a sense that the therapist sought to understand your difficulty. GL.
"Yeah, gaming is supposed to be a thing we enjoy in our spare time, something to wind down from work or studies. If it's causing you this much stress I'd definitely recommend stepping away, maybe doing something that you find more calming. "
"1. Why do you see others as inferior? You didn't go to MIT or Harvard. You (probably) aren't a generational intellect. Why is this the first shield you throw up against people?
2. Why are you looking towards dates as validation? Other people being happy with you won't make you happy with yourself. 
3. Go back to that place that you owe sixty bucks. Give them the money. Explain why you fell short and what's going on with you, they'll help. Nobody listens better than an objective third party."
"As a young female myself, I felt better seeing another female therapist closer to my age. Therapists and psychiatrists are supposed to be well versed in cultural and socioeconomic differences, but they’re regular people too and have their own biases and such. So find someone you think you could identify with. They’re not there to be your friend, but it helped me to have someone relatable showing me how to help myself and who also understood whatever dumb memes and shit I’d reference. "
"Don't get too hung up on your diagnosis.  Don't make your diagnosis part of your identity, because it's just a label.  It's like your therapist said, ""You have abandonment issues"" that's all.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked as a counselor and had to give people diagnoses.  Not only do we not always get the category right, but we're not sure the categories themselves are right.  If you view yourself instead as a person with a collection of symptoms, the diagnosis won't feel like such a heavy burden."
"I think it's normal to behave differently with your parents vs. friends, but it sounds like you have anxiety when you're around them. There must be a reason for this.

Maybe they have certain expectations and you're nervous to fulfill them?
Maybe they expect you to act a certain way, but you feel like you're restrained from acting naturally?
Maybe they have certain opinions which clash with yours, but you feel yours are oppressed because your parents can't listen to or accept your opinions?"
"I took one of those official tests (from a known psychology site) and I got 100% that I am a Pyromaniac. I'm not bragging but that test made me realize that I needed to seek help. I called the counseling center that day.

They aren't 100% for everyone but darn of this one wasn't dead on. It probably saved me a lot of heartache. Just seeing the words ""You suffer from Pyromania...get help now before you hurt someone with your Mania (sic)"" made my heart drop and it freed me.

Good luck to you."
"If you feel that way you should seek therapy ASAP. Reddit isn't going to be enough to help you.

If what you're feeling is an intrusive thought, like you think ""I could do that"" and then immediately think ""oh shit, what a horrible thought, I would never do that!"" then you're unlikely to be at risk of actually hurting someone. But if it doesn't stop there, like if you think of ways that you could or reasons you could use to justify it, that is pretty serious and way above Reddit's pay grade."
"If you're looking for coping methods, my number one way to deal with depression is by exercising. It helps you release negative emotions and it'll also give you something productive to do.

I also do house work and yard work. Those two things might not seem like fun but they help take my mind of my depression. So it works for me.

It doesn't matter what it is. You just have to find healthy coping methods. It can be anything really. And it help if it's something that's considered productive."
"Oh dear. I know that keyed up, tied in knots feeling. It’s terrible isn’t it? Remember (even reread your own post and updates) it passes. I can’t get my body and mind under control until I calm my breath. Perhaps check out a breathing app to turn to when it gets bad. I use BreathPacer which helps me stop, breath, and get my mind under control. Other options are reading aloud, singing a song out loud, even blowing bubbles. They help me disconnect from intrusive thoughts. Best of luck. "
"What’s really annoying to me is when people claim to have social anxiety and then you see them in a crowd of strangers telling a dramatic joke.  Feeling shy is not the same as social anxiety. The next time someone says, “My kid struggles with social anxiety too,” (kid is probably a cheerleader) I’m going to say nicely, “Oh, good to know, who’s their doctor?...When were they diagnosed?”

"p/s its also not about being tough. If i was dismissive towards someones feelings i would want them to come discuss it with me, and let me know what ways I could respond that would actually be helpful or at least neutral/not hurtful. Again, its hard to properly discuss this when we are speaking about a generalized population, and not a specific person/incident, but it sounds like you just had personally experienced something very negative to feel so strongly about  placing blame somewhere? "
"When I finally took the leap and decided to get help for myself, I called my GP and asked to be seen right away. I explained that I wasn't able to function at home or work. I was throwing up constantly. I was in a bad way. He prescribed me some medicine and checked back with me after a few weeks. He continued to try different meds and dosages and then referred me to an amazing psychiatrist and therapist. It took me a month or two to be seen, but once I did.... man she changed my life. Legit. My therapists too. I'm sorry that it is taking so long for you to get seen when you are doing all the right things. I hope you will be persistent and fight for your life. Are you in the US? If so, what area? I'd be glad to help you coordinate something. "
"Do you live in a large city? Bigger cities have Community Mental Health Centers which provide free or low cost care. 
Another idea is to have your friend contact their prescribing doctor and ask for an increase of meds to help through a difficult time. 

The new job sounds like something positive happening in your friend's life, a reason to live. Remind your friend about their reasons to live. Remind them that you care and are willing to listen.

Hospital debt can often be reduced if you simply call and negotiate, tell the billing department that you do not have this money. Usually they can get the bill reduced, they can sometimes find grants or charity to reduce the amount, ask that you pay a small amount per month so that the account is not delinquent. 

Ultimately though if this friend's life is imminent danger then you'll want to get them in the hospital, the debt can always be dealt with in some way such as bankruptcy, payment plans or write off, but the friend's life cannot be replaced."
"Thank you. I am considering going back to therapy. I read your other reply to the OP and noticed you mentioned CBT. Without meaning to impose on you I'd really like to hear your view on this: 

Honestly I am a bit hesitant about going back to therapy after my first experience with it properly between 2012 and 2014. My depersonalisation developed after going to counselling with CBT. My therapist very much emphasised the 'don't believe everything you think' mantra and encouraged me to think of my thoughts and feelings as 'passing mental events' - described as my mind and imagination being overactive, it doesn't necessarily mean I truly feel that way. I found it very helpful at the time but honestly I feel like it has been very destructive to my mental health in the long term. Does this sound like a total misinterpretation of CBT to you? I'm nervous to return to conversations about disentangling my thoughts, feelings and environment again because that relationship is fundamentally broken down..."
"Mindfulness seems to only work for people who are already in good mental health, with no history of past or current trauma, no ongoing anxiety, and who generally aren't already aware of what they're thinking or why.  If you've got PTSD or anxiety, mindfulness will just have you ruminate on those memories or thoughts again and again and again and again and again and again until you have break yourself out, and then you'll have mindfulness advocates pouring out of the woodwork telling you you're doing it wrong because it can *never* be that mindfulness was a bad idea for you.  No, never.  

And if you're already aware of what you're thinking and when, then mindfulness will, at best, waste your time.  At worst, it could send you into an anxiety or PTSD spiral.  And then the mindfulness-pushers will come out of the woodwork *again* to tell you you're doing it wrong, because one of the secret core tenets of mindfulness is that you're always wrong; that's why you need mindfulness after all.  It goes hand in hand with CBT, which I note you're also unfortunate enough to be stuck in at the moment.

Mindfulness *does not work for everyone*, and that's okay.  If mindfulness is not helping you, OP, *it is okay to stop*.  Good luck.

P.S. And to jump on in ahead of the mindfulness-pushers out there, it's not just me saying this, no matter how much you'll say it's just me saying this.  Less than five seconds on google turns up articles like these:

"FMLA is available to those who have been employed for one full year and have worked 1,250 hours or more during that year. If you are a part time employee that would mean working no less that 24 hours per week every single week of that year."
Get into a hobby that you highly enjoy that requires a lot of your attention. For example I do a lot of pottery and love it. It completely engulfs my mind when I'm doing it since if I took my mind off of it what I'm making would fall apart.
"Have you told your therapist that the techniques that they taught you aren't working?  There's a ton of different ones.  

Don't kill yourself.  You won't feel this way forever.  It's simply a matter of finding what technique works for you."
I agree! I think a lot of people if they are prepared for and expecting the experience can find a lot of good out of it. That's why there are sitters and guides etc. Idk though after what I saw idk if I'd ever be prepared for it again haha.
"I'll try talking to a therapist if I ever have a chance, the Canadian mental health system is fucked. Maybe I'll find myself a circle of guy friends to spend some time with, probably some other outcasts so I can feel comfortable. Thank you."

"To be honest this sounds different to AIWS. seeing people that aren't there isn't one of the symptoms here. This is more to do with a discombobulation of the sense of time, scale and proportionality in the visual, somatosensory etc domains."
Ugh thank you that really helps. I’ve always struggled with self love and letting relationships define me. The general recommendation I’m getting is to just be single and enjoy myself and the right one will come when I least expect it!
Yeah that’s just a tough situation all around. I wish there was something I could do or say to ease both of your burdens. Do you go to therapy? The caregiver carries around a big burden. It could be beneficial to have an unbiased outlet.
"Attraction can be about really subtle things. I have certainly found myself attracted to people that really weren't all that attractive, physically and/or personality wise. But then there might be one subtle aspect of that person that just SUCKS you in .

Have you played the fantasy out (in your mind)? Sometimes, that gets you over it. Or, try talking to her and figure out something you don't like about her, that's a real turnoff, and sometimes its just like POOF wtf was I even thinking. lol"
"Have you tried meditation? It's not a quick solution but it may help in becoming aware of the anxiety and how it arises.
It sound like you grew up in a difficult environment but that isn't you, it's how your family affected  your perception  and how they treated you.
I also have a lot of problems with perception and blame which manifests in various ways. Unfortunately society usually doesn't offer wisdom, it offers academic degrees, jobs, money, all of which do not directly lead to healing. "
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

"Main difference for me is that my previous therapists used to tell me why I was feeling the way I did or talk for way to long about medical terms and such. My current and bet therapist constantly asks questions and let’s me come to my own conclusions while helping me stay on the right mind track. 

This has been the biggest help to me as I am now able to step back and ask those questions to myself to help realize what I’m feeling and why, instead of just ‘talking there word for it’.
"
Thanks man. I’m just having a hard time because well it makes me believe all sorts of things. I’ve noticed that since my sexuality is one of the biggest things I have anxiety around. My geometry teacher is an anecdotal guy and he just said “when you’re talking with your wife or husband” and after he said “or husband” my urges slowly started changing from heterosexual to homosexual. What the hell is going on anymore!? UGH. I’m fricken tired of this! And yeah I see your point.
"You don't sound psychotic but the fact that you're even having these concerns (and they are somewhat concerning) is probably a good reason to seek help. It was the right choice to stop seeing a therapist you didn't feel was right for you. That said, just because the one therapist didn't with out doesn't mean another therapist wouldn't be great for you. It's important to shop around for therapists since everyone is different and the styles of different therapists are suitable for different people.

I'd also strongly recommend seeing a psychiatrist. While a rapid ideological shift could be normal, it sounds like that combined with your own perception that your behavior is a bit off the wall makes for a good reason to get a professional opinion."
I can relate to the whole fighting the thoughts thing making them worse. Have you tried ACT? It is a bit different to CBT as instead of trying to challenge your thinking you just accept it and let it be in the background rather than engaging with it. It is not something you can do straight away but a therapist can help. I would also try some medication. There is no harm in trying. I would also discuss your suicidal thoughts with the professionals. I know you are prob afraid of being sectioned in hospital if you are honest but unless you have a set plan which you are going to act on they won’t do that. You would be surprised at how common these thoughts are. I think most healthy people have suicidal thoughts at least once in their life. I see a psychiatrist and a psychologist and am completely open about wanting to die and they have never tried to admit me to hospital. Just discuss your thoughts but at the same time reassure them they are just thoughts not an action plan and you will be fine.
"I don't think it would be a bad idea to see a therapist about this; they help with this sort of thing. Often when people don't have a constant core self, it stems from an upbringing where a child was expected to live up to expectations and be someone they were not for the benefit of the parents. Sometimes, they were punished if they were themselves and rewarded when they minimized differences between them and their parents. They may have been enmeshed with their parent and often couldn't tell where one person ended and the other began. 

Many people with this issue also have ongoing difficulties with boundaries and can get easily enmeshed with others. If you find yourself needing to emulate the people around you and it causes you anxiety to refrain from doing this (or like you said, if it's impossible to refrain,) it may be time to ask for some help from a therapist. It's sometimes hard to navigate boundaries by yourself and there's no shame in having someone point you in the right direction. "
"Thanks for the reply. It was just a letter that said 'We're sorry you couldn't make your appointment on the xxx, your care is being returned to your GP'. I agree that zyprexa is a tough medication. I've gained so much weight on it and having memory problems to the point I can be scared to cross the road without triple checking for cars first.

I don't suffer from psychosis (unless I've a litre of whiskey or vodka in me) and was told it is for mood stabilising. Been on so many different med combo's over the years and really want to take control of my health before my brain is fried. I did miss two appointments in a row, first one i forgot that it was on that day, and the second we know. Takes months to see a Dr and the time between my psych appointments has averaged about 3 months and a lot happens in that time window. I'm going to call the GP to have a chat. Feel quite useless as i'm unable to work atm either and work makes such a positive impact on my sense of self-worth and being kept busy. "
"All I can say is this:

I haven't met you, but I love you. Woman to woman, I know how hard it can be when someone you thought loved you takes advantage of you and then leaves you high and dry. Just remember that he is the broken one, the monster who abandoned a woman who loved him and a baby who could have loved him. You are so strong for having made it this far, and we here are proud of you for that. Hopefully one day you can be proud, too.

Whenever you feel like you're drifting down into that abyss, remember that your family would miss you. I am sure you feel like a burden, but I promise they love you and your baby. If they didn't, they wouldn't help. Remember that your baby would grow up without you. You may think that would be for the better, but I know from experience that he/she will always wonder what it would have been like to grow up with mom's love.

If you feel like you can't go on, go on for them.

You may be able to find some groups that aren't too expensive that can help you. If you call a crisis line, they could help you find those. You're not alone in this struggle, and finding people who understand is more therapeutic than I can explain in words on Reddit.

Just stay strong, be brave, and love your baby with all of your heart."
"Hey!

I'm sorry to hear your not feeling well. Do you have anybody to talk to? Maybe a friend, parent, teacher, coworker, psychologist? It might help you to just talk about why you're not feeling well. 

I really believe that you can do it! "
"How old are you? And you mentioned that you have a good relationship with your bf, family and friends... have you kind of pin pointed why you’re depressed? I’m just asking because everything you wrote sounds like something I would write."

"Yea, I can't change how they think as it's beyond my control. I guess I should just keep going down my road to recovery, and if they're gonna be supportive, great! and if not, get rid of them as this current situation is making things worse."
"Yeah. “How are you?” I’m okay. “How was school?” Fine. “Are you feeling okay?” Yeah.
Feels like I hit a block and just can’t say anything about it. Like I’m being held at gunpoint not to, as much as I need to talk about it."
Yes he knows I have intrusive thoughts going on. When he wasn't available his coworker phoned me to make sure I am all right and have the needed resources such as the help line and the reminder to head into a hospital if things are not right
"i'm really glad you're striving for recovery and therapy. i'm in therapy and the days between appointments seem so long and so tiring, and I miss having someone who is on my side and no one else's. 

I've been tired and its been really rough"
"Hi, its really amazing how you are being able to recognize and question what's happening to you at your age. I respect you. You are dealing with what is known as dissociation, or the feeling that you are not in your own body anymore. This can be triggered by many things, mainly anxiety. Since this happens to you in social situations, it is safe to say that maybe you suffer from social anxiety. Seek help, talk to a parent, teacher, counsellor, or anyone who has an open mind. 
Good-luck 
Rm :) "
"I can share!! First a disclaimer as we all know how mental health is personal so what helped for me might not help for you. 

Realising how bad it was was step one for me. I was taking all my pent up anger out on my ex and when she left started taking it out on myself.

Personally I then started removing myself from high stress experiences though work being the worst I can't really remove myself from that. 

I then gave my anger another target which wasn't me or another person, video gaming. "
"I'm talking mc 100+ and cutting between traffic not a roller coaster or something inherently safe. If Your so board you want to die, then you put some skin in the game. Rock climbing(free style), squirl suit, swimming with sharks, ECT.

"I tend to look at it from the perspective that your guilt of acceptance makes you a good person, or at the very least it means you appreciate what a huge deal it is and how generous your granddad is being. Don't trivialise that. There are plenty of people who are too spoilt to appreciate such a gift, so I think it's great that can see how big of a deal this is. 

However, it's really not that big of a deal on your granddads end. I'm sure he loves you and is so proud of you for going to uni, and I bet part of that is him wanting you to do as well as you possibly can. He wants to support you in this, and this gift is his way of doing that. He's offering you a tool to do better, or to make your life easier, and I think that's something you should accept. You might never get rid of all the guilt, but don't feed sad for this. There's no pressure, the man wants to help you and by accepting his gift think about how happy you're going to make him in return. Better yet, go to uni with his gift and smash your exams, get excellent grades and repay him for his support. 

It's good to be modest with gift acceptance, but this is a family member who cares about you and wants you to succeed, you'll make him happier accepting the gift than you will declining it."
"I totally understand how you feel. For so long I justified everything I was feel. I felt down because I didn’t like my job, I was upset because I felt disconnected to my friends, very similar I think to what you’re talking about. 

After talking with my therapist, I was able to realise that I’m human and we need things to make sense. I wasn’t feeling depressed because of these specific things, I was depressed and my mind was trying to justify that feeling. 

It wasn’t that I was trying to find a reason to feel depressed, it was that I was depressed and my mind was trying to explain it away and I’m in the process of trying to allow myself to accept that.

I felt I was being dramatic for a couple years and I deteriorated until my family and friends were noticing there was something wrong. That’s when I decided to just give in and go and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. Even if you don’t want a therapist to sort through all your issues, it’s extremely helpful to let everything out to someone you know understands what you’re going through. 

Hopefully this helps some. I understand the pain of depression but just remember that there’s always hope, it’s a thought I have to cling on to desperately but it always helps. "
"Sometimes I feel like professionals don't have a very good grasp on how helpful labels can be to patients.

Sure, some patients latch onto them and it slows down their healing. But for others, being *without* a label slows down their healing, because without a label what is there? There's blaming oneself, there's a *lot* of confusion, there's a constant sense of scrabbling. Searching for something that works, and then when you find something that works you have no idea *why* it works. It's a mess.

Labels bring order to chaos. And they often make treatment a lot quicker. ""We need to work on the fact that you split, which you do b/c you have BPD"", is quicker and easier and more accepted than trying to fumble the way to getting the patient to accept that they behave in that manner, and then accept that it's a problem, and then accept treatment for it.

Besides, labels becoming part of a person's identity is not something I would say slows down the healing process. It's something I would say it *part* of the healing process. If someone is doing it it's something they clearly need to do to feel secure, and therefore it's an issue the therapist needs to address. Avoiding giving them a label doesn't make that need, that issue, go away. Treatment will."
"Sebastian, the human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations.

Significantly, this is true for ALL adults. This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because you lack the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions. This means that you experience very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.  If you suffer from lifetime BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. 

Fortunately, most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions.  They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to regulate your own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Absent those skills, you must continue to rely on the primitive ego defenses used by young children: projection, denial, temper tantrums, magical thinking, and black-white thinking.  Has your psychologist recommended that you start participating in a program such as DBT that will teach you the missing coping skills?"
"Take it from someone who stayed in a relationship for 5 years with a dude that fits that description to a T— get the f*** out as soon as you possibly can. Like even if it seems impossible to get out, there is always a way-find that way. 

Listen, I stayed with the guy mostly because every time I woke up to the fact that I needed to get the hell out of there, he would masterfully guilt trip me into staying. Saying he would kill himself if I left&amp; that his death would be on my hands, saying that he would be incapable of surviving without me... he would tell me (very convincingly) that nobody besides him would be able to “handle” someone like me, that I was extremely lucky he was able to put up with the way I was. (Now 5 years after the breakup I can truly see that I’m very much a normal person compared to him). He used many manipulations to get me to stay. And I even felt genuine love for him and even felt protective of him when others would say something about how seriously f***ed up he was... I literally would defend my abuser. 


And maybe your dude doesn’t seem like an “abuser” to you, you probably might even see him as someone who is deeply hurt and needs someone to take care of him (not saying he’s no deeply hurt, but that’s besides the point)—but trust me, that is abuse. Abuse does not have to be physical. That’s called gaslighting someone, and everything you’ve described is textbook mental/emotional abuse. And the dude I dated started out the first few years with just mental/emotional abuse but eventually that turned into physical abuse on top of everything else. 

Trust me. Your boyfriend is shit. Leave while you can. Do you know how much money I pay for therapy now? Like... I’m diagnosed with ptsd and struggle constantly with severe anxiety because of that guy. And the two other girls he dated after I left him have the same exact story and are also in therapy for ptsd. Just because a guy isn’t giving you a black eye doesn’t mean you’re not being abused.  "
"Hey, you're not alone in this man, I used to be the same and sometimes I still lose my shit. You would definitely benefit from seeking out therapy and such but I'm gonna give you a bit of my viewpoint and experience regarding bursts of anger. The reason you lash out at your gf is because she is close to you. Depending on why the anger starts it's either because she can tick you off easily because of the closeness or because you're too insecure to vent your emotions elsewhere.

In my experience these anger bursts stem from two things:
1) venting kind of bursts: these result from a buildup. Doesn't have to be buildup towards her, could be unrelated, maybe from work or such. You're comfortable with your gf so that's why you let your frustrations out. If this rings a bell, look for the sources of frustration. It can be something that happened that day or it can be something long term. For example I'm too insecure and stupid to talk to my co-workers about mistakes they do when they do them which is a huge mistake on my part. Then a month or two later I just fucking explode and get all passive aggressive on them.
What you can do: if it's a buildup from your gf, think about what ticks you off and work on talking about these issues regularly, it's a good habit, I can give you some advice on how to do this if you relate to this
If it's a buildup from elsewhere - well, you would have to work on communicating this with the people it's directed at, but that's more of a long term goal, but again, I'm sure your gf loves you and if it's a buildup from elsewhere, talk to her about your frustrations while talking about how your day was, the validation and support she could provide could help

2) sudden bursts: there is probably something that is being covered up by the anger. In me it's usually fear or feeling that my partner is invalidating my point. Look for the underlying issue. Try wording it out to yourself. Just a personal monologue. Then you can work on communicating it to your gf.

I attend DBT and there is one skill in particular that I think could help you. It's called STOP skill, look it up. It takes a little bit of practice but most people I know benefit from this skill.

Hope I helped at least a bit and wasn't too off! I understand how the aftermath of such a conflict feels and please, don't feel so bad about it. Yes it's horrible but you can work on this and honestly, the fact you identified that you have an issue in this and are taking steps in the right direction is amazing and admirable. Stay strong!"

Yes and no? It does get annoying how my depression gets in the way of me doing things but I’d prefer that over being happy really. And no sometimes avoid things that’ll make me happy or sometimes I’ll do things that make me feel worse.

I have never heard of this but it sound like the sky initiates an Existential Crisis in you.  Its the idea that the vastness of time and space and an uncaring universe is just too incomprehensible for us.  Most of us have it but the sky exists in our realm of imagination."
"Hey, just a quick note--this guy giving you advice appears to have a bias against therapy (maybe from a bad experience) and he's giving you bad advice. There are lots of great therapists out there both male and female. And I don't know what he means by ""liberal programs"" but it's not like men go to separate counseling psychology programs from women--we all take the same classes. The most important thing is you find someone with extensive professional experience with whom you feel comfortable. "
"I am sorry for everything you are experiencing. It sounds very difficult. I don't think that befriending someone with DID will help you. People with DID are not just a group of people sharing one mind. They are people who have been deeply traumatized and are dealing with their own very difficult mental health issues. If you are also dealing with your own struggles, that could be a very bad combination. You're likely to unintentionally do a lot of harm. 

I hope that things get better for you. "
"I can relate to this. Humans gross me out too for the same reasons you mentioned, but I don’t think I experience it to the same extent that you do. Most of the time, I just try to ignore the grossed out feeling and that usually works for me and gets me through day to day interactions. But within the last year or so, this problem has like destroyed my sex life because I just find humans too gross to be attracted to or to have sex with.  That’s really the only time that I can’t ignore it. "
"If you had a bad experience so early in life, I believe that anxiety could be formed at that time, and you possibly can suffer with it throughout your life because that one event taints everything else...especially if it was truly frightening/distressing. I would go talk to someone to see if he/she can help you ease your anxiety a bit. Talking might help and even though I hate meds, those are possible too. I take an anti-anxiety medication myself. I sure do need it most days. Good luck to you!"
"The problem is that, even with a written record, emotional contamination completely fucks with memory recall. This is to say that, if you're in a good mood and are trying to remember a negative experience or a depressive episode, you're going to have a spectacularly difficult time, journal entry or no journal entry.

I write every singly day and have gone through my journal with therapists in the past. Sometimes it helps but for the most part, the only thing that helps them understand is time."
"What activities are you doing or are good at where you can meet ladies? 

Do you dance or play an instrument?
Into motorcycles or cars? 
Are you in a club of any kind or in a sport? Are you into making food or beverages? Do you go to the beach or mountain hike or bike? What are your hobbies aside from gaming? 

Are you careful with your hygiene and have clean clothes? Keeping fit? 

Can you start and hold a friendly conversation? Do you have guy friends you go out with that can be a wing man? "
"Going for a nice walk outside is free. Buying a book you love and can read over and over again is a small price. What about volunteering at an animal shelter if you enjoy animals? 1 hour on the weekends? Doesn’t cost anything and you get to play/be around animals! A great solution if you’re an animal lover but don’t want to make the actual commitment or spend the money to *buy* a pet. 

Is it really worth it to sacrifice all of your happiness, time, and money to buy a house? What’s the point if you’re so unhappy by the time you can buy it that you won’t even enjoy the house? 

Houses will always be around. It won’t hurt to sacrifice $15 on a weekend to buy a movie you might enjoy, or whatever other hobby you’d be interested in. "
"I suffered from the same situation . My thoughts are destructive at times. Destructive in the sense it destroys my peace of mind. I cry , shut myself but none of it works. I have tried several things that has helped me in some ways.

I talk to myself , i console myself, I make my mind believe that positive things are on their way. This phase is temporary . Nothing is permanent in this world.

I write. I write everything whatever is irritating me or troubling me. I feel better after writing it.

I try to indulge myself in household or any other work . I force myself to go for a run.

I sometimes take myself out to lunch as well. I observe people at the restaurant.

I am in a much better place now.

JUST STAY POSITIVE. LIFE IS GOOD.

"Remember that we are not mind-readers.  Someone taking something without a thank you is rude, but you shouldn't then take that rudeness to mean they don't like you.  They might just have poor manners or feel entitled or take you for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

To most people, you are a background character they have no strong feelings about either way.  The thought ""nobody likes me"" is your social anxiety talking.

&amp;#x200B;

I say, just imagine you had an identical twin that was just like you but lived somewhere else.  Would you dislike that person for their faults? Probably not.  You would probably like that person just fine.  I like to imagine a twin version of myself when I need a little objectivity so maybe that technique will help you too."
"Well, I used to live to try to matter to someone else.
Got fucked over a year ago. And ever since then, my life has been reduced to tatters.
So, I want to rewind the time to revisit those happy times to relive those good moments. Its weird how I want to get stuck into the past because that was wonderful and at the same time correct everything that comes my way. A second chance at every mistake, would make things better.

Ah, but snapping back to reality always makes me feel livid, melancholic and absolutely worthless, all intermixed within seconds for hours together.

Somehow get through the day. Company does help but somehow doesn't make me forget anything about that one person that I cared for, that I fucked up for and I would still die for. "
"Wow that's a lot of awesome stuff honestly. A lot of strong negative emotions. Your post actually helped me just now. I'm going through some extreme and unnecessary anger... rage even. I get so angry when I feel like I've been slighted in the smallest bit. It's not normally how I behave but it seems to just happen and get intense every once in a while. I'm just reminded now of how it will pass and I just need to avoid ruining any relationships or doing anything stupid I'll regret later. Definitely know though that other people can see themselves being super unreasonable and find it hard to stop. You seem so aware, and that IS a good thing. It's a gift a lot of people will never have and It will help you a lot through life. So just keep trying! "
"Your brain can actually block it completely out as it happens. 

You could be abused an hr ago and have no memory of the event. ALTHOUGH you will definitely feel uncomfortable, unsafe, anxious or startled after the event has happened. You might not understand why. You might feel extremely uncomfortable at your friends house if it was one of them who did it. You can also feel uncomfortable hearing certain words sometimes it certainly ways because the abuser said it. You don’t need to remember the event your mind only tends to recall the feelings during it. 

Heres an example:  you might have forgotten how you lost your virginity but you how it made you feel. If you were told you were bad you might be discouraged to try it again.

You can easily be discouraged when you see your abuser even if you can’t remember being abused. 

When i lived with my parents i Never felt actually safe so i have reason to believe they did it. I cant confirm this but it dose easily stop me from thinking about them."
"Then the teacher should be well aware why human blood is no longer considered generally okay to use in art. There are a ton of risk factors, challenges, and potential legal liabilities. The last one is the big reason most colleges discourage or even forbid students from using bodily fluids as art mediums. 

If your professor is presenting this in a dangerous way that encourages people to do it then please report them to the head of the department. Also it's insensitive and invasive to request people share about their self harm to a stranger. Don't put up with that! 

The performance art class I took in college had an entire section devoted to discussing how self mutilation, blood, and disease awareness changed in the art world. (Please note that performance art is art being created with the artist in front of, with, or near the audience thus the usage of open or uncontained blood could come into unintentional contact with an audience member.) There have been additional discussions throughout the art world about the use of blood as a medium in non-live art such as in a sealed vial or as a paint. As an organic matter bloodworks aren't easy to conserve, and there is that pesky matter of them being a biohazard. 

Side question are they also talking about the following artists at all? (TW: blood, menstruation, &amp;/or self harm) Marina Abramović, Pyotr Pavlensky, Chris Burden, Orlan, Connor Collins, Elito Circa,  Ron Athey, Andres Serrano, Gina Pane, Christen Clifford, Portia Munson, or Marc Quinn? 
"
"&gt; Also, whats with the burning hatred for random people who are mean online? 

I dunno. That is just my mental state. Anyone who would randomly be mean to mean while I am in such distress and I'm being earnest is obviously an evil person. They shouldn't hold power over anyone else or be allowed to interact with people. If I could kill them and suffer no consequences, I would gladly do it. I would be happy to take someone's life over something as trivial as comment on the internet. 

The point I need someone to take care of me. My parents are busy with my autistic sister (although people on /r/autism will say it is isn't a disability, but they're so high functioning they can pass for normal so fuck them), so they have no time for me. By living in the middle of nowhere I am being denied any ability to care for myself. If I am hungry, I can't leave the house. I need to get a ride into to town to pick up my drugs. I basically can't do anything myself. I feel like I am being isolated and neglected. I can't do anything without someone else's help, and no one will help me. The only people who have people who will care for them are those who don't need it. 

No one will listen to me when I talk. My autistic sister just starts yelling at me any time I even slightly raise my voice. It is impossible to have a conversation. My medication doesn't work and I can't see psychiatrist. It isn't about treating myself with compassion. I'm helpless and ignored and there isn't any help available. I couldn't even get admitted to a hospital because my condition isn't being caused by an ""acute"" mood disorder. I can't fix my mental health and I have to live in this terrible environment. I then get blamed for not doing enough when there is nothing I can realistically do. "
"""Brain Zaps"" is exactly what I called it when I was withdrawing from my SSRI (Lexapro).  I felt like nobody knew what I was talking about. Hang in there, fellow human. You are not alone. My zaps lasted for a few weeks but eventually subsided. "
"&gt;I do all of this to protect myself and others from how bad it really is inside. I know it's not healthy but I don't know how else to be.

This is the same for me.  I find that I start to shut down when asked to speak to what I deal with.  "
"And just when you thought I was done, my mind started imagine your responses according to my attention seeking desires

""Thats alot to unpack""

""Are you alright?""

""I hope you feel better""

""Let me give you \_\_\_\_\_ advice""

the list goes on"
"Bullshit.

Stop spamming.

EDIT: Upon review, your ""proof"" is a short article of woo and a link to someone else's YouTube video.  It lacks evidentiary sufficiency to even rise to the level of ""wrong.""  Conclusion: get fucked and stop spamming."
"Congratulations on your sobriety! 

I think I’ve been considering our suitability for a little while... maybe I’m just scared of losing someone I love so much 

Thank you very much for your kind words, and I really wish you the best ��"
"Depression wants you to stay still and not move. If it had its way, you'd be spending your life in bed hiding under the covers. So MOVE. Even if that means just getting up and taking a shower (great advice). 
Depression hates a moving target. "
"I appreciate your examples here, thanks for sharing! That seems like a really healthy way of approaching things, while keeping it honest and light. I agree learning to read people well is a very helpful skill in this regard, or in general. ;-)"
"I appreciate your insight.  I hope he feels as you do.  I am worried he will reject the idea he has a problem and view me as trying to hold him back in some way.  I am not sure why I feel that way, many small things, but I have to try I think."
I don't feel like I fit in either. I've been a loner my entire life. And I haven't had a single friend in years. All I want out of life is love and happiness. I'm not into materialism or greed or whatever. I get you. I feel the same exact way.
"I don't find adrenaline rushes themselves fun, more like the situation that brings them on. With what I've tried, I know I'm in no real danger so it doesn't make me feel anything. Thought I haven't tried skydiving or bungee jumping so I might."
"I need to be listening to music a lot Because of the intrusive thoughts that hammer at me 24/7.

They literally dont leave me alone. When at home the TV serves to distract me, but when I'm out...I need music to do the same thing. I understand."
I went to a Behavioral Health in patient clinic for 4 days and that really helped. After that I was referred to a partial hospitalization center and they both helped immensely. There are some things we can't do alone. It's okay to ask for help
I'm finding it hard to be consistent with it as I find it hard to retrospective about how I feel and it's not always easy to do it in the moment. Having a bit more success with mood tracking apps cause then it's just a button.  Thanks though.
"My plan at the moment is to just give her space and hope she comes to the conclusion that she’s throwing away something special on her own. It’s the hardest thing ever to do. I mean, I’ve typed out and deleted countless messages to her. "
"Sorry to hear that, and that the doctors don't have a clear answer for you. Have you tried seeing a therapist? They may have some additional insight if the doctor thinks there may be some depression going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck to you. "
Thanks for saying anything. It's nice to hear someone that understands that. I don't think a lot of people realize what it is like to have literally nobody that you feel like you can talk to. There is just this kind of constant pain in me now.
"That moment when you're laughing with someone and you take a step back and think, ""wow, I'm so freaking happy right now"". Having that moment is bliss. So I guess laughing to the point where you can't think of anything else but your happiness. "
This woman just had no one who cared about her. It's as simple as that. Very sad as the daughter is now motherless and will probably end up with a very similar out look by the time she's the mothers age. My blessing go out to this young child.
"Until you are able to get into an area offering DBT therapy, it likely would be helpful to acquire one of the DBT Self Help books that are available online.  I also suggest you ask the pwBPD in the BPD sub (here on Reddit) what works for them."
"What about joining an extracurricular or two - clubs, sports etc. I made some wonderful friends from the cross country team in high school. I was never a runner before but decided to try it after my mom encouraged me to and I am so glad I did!"
"Where does pyromania fit in there?   
I didn't get this at all...but then again, I am a total BONEHEAD today. No, really...my attention span is that of a piece of fruit and my mind is all over the place today.   


Interesting read, though. :)"
"i don’t want this to last a few years. and i don’t know about seeking help. last time i went to see someone, it went in the way of my school and family life. are those the only options i have or is there something else i can also consider?"
"sounds like intrusive thoughts, everyone gets them but mentally ill ppl more so than others, dont pay attention to them but u may want to work on any anger issues u may have. best of luck, and remember these thoughts do not make u a bad person"
I don’t think this is necessarily the case. She may just be depressed with a chemical imbalance. I was in college and had to take a semester off because I had depression and it got really bad. Semester later got DNA testing done. Which I highly recommend. Got a kick ass psychiatrist and psychologist went back to school and did very well. So yes it does get better but address your mental issues first then see if grad school is for you. It may not be or you may just be in a mentally bad place.
"I work in demographic marketing.  Consumer markets are divided into age, income, zip codes, etc.   We had one customer who wanted a multigenerational list.   A multigenerational is often 3 or more adults at the same physical address; usually older children or sometimes two separate families.

We found out that he was a home builder and he was looking to build ""multigenerational"" homes.  Not big houses - think duplexes on steroids.  I said ""I hope a therapist is part of the purchase price"".  ; )"
"You should see if ypur university offers therapy. If they do you might be able to meet woth a therepist on campus and it would mitigate having extra stress financially and getting to a therapists office.  

I know schools sometimes have puppies brought in to help with students stress during finals, if you like animals you should look into visiting a local animal shelter to play with the dogs and if it helps maybe volunteer there both to reduce stress and volunteering looks good on your resume. "
"**Imaginary audience**

The imaginary audience refers to a state where an individual imagines and believes that multitudes of people are enthusiastically listening to or watching him or her.  Though this state is often exhibited in young adolescence, people of any age may harbor a fantasy of an imaginary audience.

"Definitely consult with his pediatrician, the surgeon, a psychiatrist, and consider an occupational therapist as well. I'm an occupational therapy student, and over this summer I worked at a pediatric clinic with a few kids with high anxiety related to feeling things on their skin that weren't there, and compulsively checking. I'm certainly not saying that's what's happening in your son's situation, but it couldn't hurt to consult a variety of professionals.

Prior to the surgery, did he have/notice any fleas jump on him, and have a similar reaction? Or a lack of reaction? Have you had a chance to talk to his teachers about if it's affecting him at school? (Sorry to pepper you with questions when answers are what you're looking for, by the way.)"
"No. I just don't want to heal. You people don't get it, do you? It's all about one's DESIRE for help. It has nothing to do with thinking I'm better than others. I just don't want to heal. It's all about dedication and strength of will. If I had all of these, I wouldn't care anything about those misconceptions about people like me thinking we're better than others. When you really want something, you don't care about what others think nor is what your own warped psychology perceives. You just show up and do it. PERIOD. And I obviously do not have the desire, want, strength of will or care to heal. And what does it matter? I'm still a high-functioning member of society. I don't commit crimes, I don't hurt people. So what is there to heal? Nothing."
"Not trying to scare you,  you may have a very different experience than I did and it may help you.  I was misdiagnosed bipolar and was put on it for a few months.  For me it was one of the worse experiences of my life.  Sleeping half the day away and taking 2 hours to get ready in the AM.  And horrible emotional side effects.  Despair like I have not known before.   Kept reducing the dosage and it never got better.  Very strong antihistimine effect,  which is where the drowziness comes from.  I finally took the pills to my psychiatrist appointment and told him to take one and see how he felt.  He declined but switched me to something else which did not work because I was never Bipolar.

I have read that it works very  well for some people once they get used to it.  How long that is varies for everyone.  Think you are supposed to taper up as well.  I wish you well.  The only way to know if it helps is to try it.  Good luck.  Don't be afraid to talk to  your Dr.  about it and give feedback.  Peace."
"Anything seems to help.  For me, its walking.  My therapist is also a great proponent of walking.

As for Yoga, I love [Yoga with Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaPp5jr--xo).  I am not very flexible but I can do most of her routines."
"As long as you told your parents you’ll be fine. If your friends don’t believe you they can just fuck right off then, not your true friends. If it continues I suppose something legal could come into play. That’s pretty messed up tho man. "
"Could be anything.  Money, dropping your insurance plan, her insurance plan dropping her, moving, anything.

My sister was dismissed once because she essentially refused complimentary therapies.  She was just there for the pills and he knew it."
"I get massive anxiety some nights and can't sleep until my girlfriend gets home.  But on the nights she can't be there, I'll put on an audio book and do some deep breathing until I can calm myself down.  Harry Potter books for the relaxing win."
"I “reached out” once and all eight nearby trauma clinics wouldn’t help me.

We do reach out. But our system is shit and doesn’t always have the capacity or resources to help everyone. I had to wait 7 months after my crisis to get help. "
"I'd ask your doctor what the difference is between [schizophrenia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6gqILp8NaQ&amp;) and [psychotic depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc3xsUxbmds&amp;), and why he thinks it's the one and not the other."
I'll consider it. I don't want anyone worrying about me. The only thing that seems to make me feel good is pottery. Video games make me feel alright but for some reason I've had a hard time enjoying them lately even though I used to love them.
"I’ve felt it too my whole life. I am highly sensitive and everyone around me could never understand that. Felt like an outsider looking in at school.  Self care is the only thing that helps me.
I just wanna give you a hug and be your friend. "
"Nevertheless, it becomes a communication issue.  If after fully explaining yourself, she is not helpful, dump her but most therapists shpuld be able to shift gears to accommodate low income people, if not, leave and tell her that specifically. "
"Since you can’t get the professional help you need right now your only option is to take very good care of yourself, decrease stress however you can, and keep talking about what’s going on. If your symptoms become unmanageable go to an ER. "
So happy for you!! I have been wanting to get that tattoo for a few months now! I turn 21 next week and might get it for myself as a bday present. I survived my attempt a little over 6 months ago. Hope things are going well for you right now :)
Thank you! I am taking a long weekend in about 3 weeks. Can you believe I only get 5 vacation days at my company?! I've recently gotten into journaling but haven't done it consistently. I'll try and do it every single day to see if that helps!
"Thank you. The irony is, I am a terrible hoarder in real life anyway! I'm looking forward to throwing out the crap :') 

Yeah, I'm really grateful that she was a good match straight away (because sometimes you have to try a few first). Thanks! "
"They do cause sedation but guanfacine is a lot less.

I cannot link you because i already know but i checked in my PDR and those where some of the things that could be.

"Unfortunately in most of NA, even here in Canada therapy is not covered by insurance at all or at least not fully. 

Even with two insurances better help is still my cheapest option yearly.... (Ontario Canada) at least my psychiatrist is free. "
"Why do you assume people care? Some behaviors aren't the result of not knowing, but of indifference. Sometimes we don't act because we can't act, but when people actively harm, when they actively damage despite being told no - that is uncaring."
"You don’t need any friends coz you got me brother, I’ll be here for you if you need me most people nowadays ye can’t trust coz they just stab you in the back, as for the depression, anorexia and self harm have you got any help for it ? :)"
"You're right, I know tomorrow I will try hard to schedule a psychiatrist and therapist appointment. I need to seek medical help again. I'm ruining everything I've worked for. I hate myself right to be honest, and I relapsed. I feel like crying "
I did almost the same thing when my bank wouldn't cash a personal check (from a relative) for me. I grabbed the check out of her hand and quite rudely and loudly told her I will take it elsewhere. I had to come crawling back after not being able to cash it ANYWHERE else...and ended up depositing it all on the debit card of my husband. I can so relate to this. I didn't want to ever have to go back there. I felt soooo embarrassed. Yikes. I hope you can have a better day and \*\*HUGGLES\*\* to you!
"I feel like you're right and there's probably a lot of people who overuse that kind of stuff who actually could exhibit diagnosable illness. At a point though -- sorry about your skin but I think that's more a special case -- the concern is more the *subtle* change. If its significant enough that they feel it should be implemented but not significant enough that people don't consciously realize what its doing, there's room for concern; the people who use that jazz are at least informed about it."
If he’s a friend I would suggest calling in today citing a personal emergency and drafting an email explaining ur situation. Just survive the next day. You aren’t a piece of shit- we all have bad and good. Life is just really fucking hard and tbh I’m trying to convince myself to chuck away my pride and figure out a way to tell my manager I’m suicidal. Either I get fired or they give me time. Either way just focusing on the next step and focusing on hour by hour helps. Distract yourself.
"You’re not the first person I’ve heard successful stories about physichiatric wards. I have a friend that has said the same thing many times over about those places.   That sucks you can’t move over to private.  I find the health coverage is the US just to be garbage. I use to have decent coverage with a company I worked at before but never used it when I should have.
I had corrective surgery recently that has made a huge difference for me recently. Now the bills are starting to pile on :/"
"Even if you are autistic, does it really matter? *Everyone* and I mean *EVERYONE* is autistic in some way. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know that feeling you may get sometimes of: Did I lock the door? Did I leave the bath running? or even the good old feeling where you think you've forgotten something when leaving somewhere? That's considered a part of autism. OCD is considered autism. Technically speaking, you would be abnormal if you didn't have some form of autism.

&amp;#x200B;

So I wouldn't sweat it. Tell your friend she can think what she wants. You don't need to go and get diagnosed for the sake of her saying ""*I told you so*"" or something along those lines. If you want to go get diagnosed that's *YOUR* decision and no-one else can make you do it."
"Thank you for replying! I am trying to see a professional but I just switched insurances and have to go through quite a bit to get a referral so haven't been able to see anyone yet. My old insurance was lacking in terms of mental health so wasnt able to see anyone more then a few times.

As for having a personality disorder I hadn't considered it until this morning when I was looking on one of those psychology websites. It's actually kinda validating hearing an actual person suggest it as well. I will definitely bring it up when I finally see someone. My best friend has offered to go with me for moral support and to keep me focus on what I need to tell them so I may bring it up with him as well.

Again thank you for replying you were very helpful"
"I am 31 and only realized I had stopped this behavior in myself this year. I attribute it to embracing self-love, which I admit seemed hokey when I was a kid (especially because I was raised in a capitalist culture whose enduring message seems to be BUY ALL THE THINGS TO FEEL BETTER) no matter what is wrong with you. 
I read this book called The 40 Rules of Love that really turned it around for me in understanding what kind of person we need to be to ourselves and to others; that, and living with a friend who practiced unconditional love towards others and herself gave me a really solid example every day of how we should treat ourselves. She credits Abraham Smith, whose videos are on youtube, for her guidance. I dont subscribe to Abraham but she has some solid advice.
Also, tell yourself in the mirror, 
""You are talented, you are intelligent, you are important,"" and when you do this get real close to your reflection so that all you see are your eyes. Say it, believe it. Every day. It changes you. "
"I am so sorry that this is something you go through/experience quite often. Also, I am deeply sorry that I came off a bit neurotic. I guess the selfish side of me some how wanted to convince people they are capable of “getting better”....after all I made some improvements with therapy. Still have “off days” but I think I’m equipped to deal.

What are ways in which you wish people would approach the topic of depression? What are ways I could support someone with depression? Also, what are things you shouldn’t say to someone with depression? Sorry for having so many questions.

I grew up with a Dad who’s mental health was “unstable” due to him having an alcoholic and abusive father. He also has a lot of health problems. As a child it was very confusing and hard for me to understand what he was going through. 

Little insight to earlier post: The experience I had was probably related to trauma from my first pregnancy. I was 19 and high risk. My fiancé and I just moved out on our own. After having the baby I had Postpartum depression on top of repressed emotions from my childhood. Those first couple of years were a roller coaster. Fast Fwd about four years later.. I found out I was pregnant again for the second time at almost 18 weeks, it kind of sent me into shock and declined from there for a few months until I was able to start seeing my therapist. I don’t see her currently and I think my hormones were able to mostly “regulate” back to some what normal after delivery though. "
"I know you've gotten a ton of suggestions here but I also want to recommend something like 7cups.com or betterhelp.com. You can do counseling online with a professional and I think both of those have a free trial period but I'm not sure they treat minors. There is also the textline (text ""hello"" to 741741) which is available to everyone in the US 24/7, or suicidepreventionlifeline.org which you can call or chat. You dont have to be standing on a ledge to use those services. 

You could ask your dad if you have health insurance, say you've been feeling off and want to try talking to a therapist, and maybe he'll take you. Also if you're able to drive, you can set up your own appt with a therapist. When you talk to them over the phone to set it up, explain your situation, ask if they'll work on a sliding scale (you don't have to use your insurance). If they see reason for keeping your parents out of it, you don't need their consent to go. 

If your parents refuse to help and it's the only way to get the help you need, you can also report them to Child Protective Services for neglect in not getting you the vital help they are obligated to. http://www.okdhs.org/services/cps/Pages/default.aspx. but teachers are also mandated reporters so if you have a favorite teacher or again, the guidance counselor, you could explain what's going on and they should be able to guide you in the right direction. Doing this might result in you getting removed from the home for a time and staying at your dad's or another relatives, while they make sure it's safe, but honestly with your mom's choice of men, it doesnt sound like it is. 

If you're able to pick a therapist, I'd look for someone who specializes in trauma. 

Okay, I think that's all I've got lol. Please take care!"
"Congratulations on reaching out for help!

&gt;I’m not really sure what to expect or what I’m going to say.

(If possible) Before seeing a professional, I recommend writing down any symptoms you're experiencing along with context like a brief summary. It can be hard to just write without any direction, so hopefully the questions below can help give some guidance. I compiled the questions I've been asked at my own appointments. You don't have to write down your answers to all of these questions, although you are certainly free to do that. There's also no pressure to write anything down at all, but I do recommend taking a look at the questions below so that you can start thinking of what to say. Keep in mind that the professional just wants to get a clear picture of your life, so that they can give you the best care possible. Their intention is NOT to interrogate you and get you to confess a crime. They want to help you get better, and in order to do that, they need to know details about your life! When you're finished, consider bringing this paper and just show it to the professional because that can take pressure off of you to perform on the spot! Here are the questions:
	
&gt;1. what would you like help with?
&gt;2. what are your symptoms?
&gt;3. when did your symptoms first start?
&gt;4. how often do your symptoms occur? All the time? At specific times of the day like before bed or when you wake up?
&gt;5. how severe would your symptoms on a scale of 1-10? Rate the quality of your life on a scale of 1-10.
&gt;6. how are your energy levels/motivation? High, normal, low, very low?
&gt;7. how is your appetite? Are you eating too much, too little, or a normal amount?
&gt;8. how is your sleep quality (good or bad)? How many hours of sleep per day? Do you feel well-rested?
&gt;9. have you lost interest in any hobbies or passions?
&gt;10. do you isolate yourself from others? 
&gt;11. what is your school/social/work/home life like? (basically, the professionals want to know if your    struggles are impacting different areas of your life and how much. For example, if you're in school and you're failing classes because you're depressed, it's important to say that you're failing classes)
&gt;12. how is your ability to focus and retain information? 
&gt;13. do you think anything has contributed to the way you are feeling like the death of a loved one?
&gt;14. how are your stress levels? How stressed do you feel on a daily basis? Anything causing stress like work or school? 
&gt;15. do you have a family history of depression/anxiety/anything else?
&gt;16. have you had any thoughts of ending your life and/or harming yourself?
&gt;17. have you harmed yourself or attempted suicide?
&gt;18. do you experience racing thoughts?
&gt;19. how would you describe your self-esteem? High, low, etc.
&gt;20. do you feel nervous often? When do you feel nervous? All the time? In front of others? Alone?
&gt;21. how would you describe your sex drive (none, low, medium, high?)
&gt;22. do you feel fatigued? How often are you fatigued/exhausted?
&gt;23. how often do your symptoms occur? Sometimes, all the time, rarely?
&gt;24. have you gained or lost weight recently? If so, how much?
&gt;25. do you experience any body aches? Joint pain?
&gt;26. do you feel like you move or talk slowly? Have others noticed this?
&gt;27. have you experienced a sudden onset of anxiety like a panic attack? how would you describe this panic attack/sudden experience of anxiety? Does it happen in crowds, alone at home, randomly, during sleep?
&gt;28. do you ever feel hopeless? If so, how often? Or like you've let yourself or others down?
&gt;29. are you taking any medication and/or supplements? If so, which ones and how much?
&gt;30. do you use any drugs in a recreational manner? If so, how much and how often?

"Both true, I guess I should have specified that this was for the majority of cases. Bipolar has a genetic component about 80% of the time and it is believed that most psychiatric disorders require an environmental component for onset to occur.  "
Both. A psychiatrist will prescribe you medicine. And a therapist will give you somebody to help sort out your thoughts and feelings. Medicine can only do so much. Sometimes combining the two of those things is the best method to getting better.
"Heh, such a cute animation! While I think this would help a person relate, it isn’t very informative overall. All I got from this is the breathing technique people do to calm down, and talking about it. I think more could of fit in that video."
"Hey, thanks for the update, I'm glad to hear you're doing better. I think starting antidepressants can be a little rough for the first couple of weeks, but hopefully once things have settled down you'll be in a much better place. 

Good luck. :)"
"I am truly happy for you! As someone who has insomnia, I wish there were a magic pill that would let me sleep more than 2-3 hours at a time (and sometimes that is total for the night)...

  
Keep your head up and enjoy that good sleep my friend!"
"I asked to investigate Buspirone or Bupropion (I'm ADHD and apparently this works well for depressed ADHD folk) got told to try this instead. 

Have a history of bad reactions, so yeah, fuck this drug, I'm seeing the doctor first thing tomorrow."
"I did a 6 week immersion program to learn French a few years ago. The first week or two are definitely the hardest, once you begin to pick up the language it does get easier. I'm not saying don't leave but I am saying is that it will get better."
"I started noticing a major change a few months ago. At least in my handwriting. I've had other stuff start since, I was just wondering if maybe that was something that wasn't talked about a lot that people noticed when developing schizophrenia. "
"It isn’t you, or I should say it isn’t just you. It happens with adults trying to make friends. We want so much to be accepted and if someone doesn’t outright say it then we assume they hate us. Give it time! You’ll make amazing friends "
"My therapist offered for me to go back in and I said ""you lock someone up for a week, make them feel safe, then push them right back into the reality that stripped them down in the first place. Thats what I am experiencing. I elect not to go.""

"
Sending you gentle hugs. I’m rooting for you and know how hopeless you may be feeling. Just sending a hug because you’re not alone. I was raised by a single parent and that’s so tough so I wish you so much luck. You will get through this.
"That’s so great. I personally have not found that my mental illness comes from my childhood; however, my boyfriend’s does. I sent him this, because it shows that damage done when you’re a child isn’t irreversible. Thank you for sharing! "
"Trust me, if you try your hardest, kids will always love you for who you are. You don't need to be perfect, as imperfect as you might feel you are, you're always going to be a better support for him than leaving him off on his own. Stay strong. "
Yeah. I am just tired right now. I have had a very stressful day and I have learned a lot about myself in 24 hours. I just need to chill and stay away from here and just hope the urges go away. :( Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. &lt;3
"I do the same thing. It's a daily struggle for me and I don't know how addicted you might be to this habit, but my only advice is to simply *stop.* Just choose not to get up and pace. I know it sounds easier said than done, but it's a start. If you want, you can write down your scenarios on paper or on your phone to channel your imagination. I did that once, and it really made a difference. In fact, I think I daydreamed less frequently about those ideas after I wrote them down. I hope this helps."
"I dont actually. Without having a two hour discussion to establish who you are as a person, where your moral code is at, et cetera, I have to operate on the idea that you are an ""average"" person who like myself is an imperfect person in an imperfect world. Its entirely possible tgat you are a serial arsonist, or an internet troll. Extreme examples, but as a function of probability vs possibility I have to go with the most likely scenario. Sorry if I seem long winded, I'm all hopped up on coffee. "
"I have a similar history with depression. Earliest I remember dealing with it was age 14, I'm now 28. 
Best advice I can offer is stick with therapy. Find a therapist who will give you tools and teach you how to deal with things as they come up. It sounds like you've actually made some really good progress; you've been able to recognize the source of the emotional turmoil and are facing it, rather than burying it. It may not feel like progress at first, but I think you're taking some good steps. "
"Ive taken all of the SNRIs and conclude after 15 years of it, that they did not help my depression. The last one I used, Mirtazapene, made my depression significantly worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I started looking into the science of it and it appears there is little difference between antidepressants and placebos, if you look at all of the trials of all of the meds over the last 20 years or so. To find out more, check out [Irving Kirsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC5RZRG7-QQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)"
"PTSD is not just for people shot in a war, my friend. It can happen anytime there is trauma, at any age. I have been told by a psychologist, mind you, that I might have PTSD or something close to it because of my traumatic childhood that I don't remember. I don't know about that and I have enough mental illnesses (yes, plural) to choke a horse, but it can happen anytime to anyone. I would go talk to someone professional and they can diagnose you properly. I am so sorry this happened to you. &lt;3"
"Start with therapy! Most therapists offer a sliding scale fee for people without insurance. There's also the option of BetterHelp.com where you can pay a small fee weekly for online therapy. 
Would you be eligible for Medicaid? There's actually a good amount of therapists who accept this insurance. 
I use PsychologyToday.com when I'm trying to find one or something similar. You can just message them from there. It really helps to narrow it down to your needs and someone who sounds good for you :)"
"&gt; Is it good to use a journal and right down how your feeling and just jot down general emotional day to day feelings?

Journaling has been proven to be very effective, at least in some areas of mental health.  My sister is a bit of a hypochondriac and her therapist  will not even entertain her latest terminal illness, unless he sees a journal entry with a date and few paragraphs about it.  Her belief is that journaling  stops the obsessive mind from, well obsessing.
 
To  uncover some of my ACEs( Adverse Childhood Experience) my therapist had me write down all the addresses that I had lived in as a child until the present.  We are working through all my past memories associated with each address.

I have no experience with magic wands though. "
"Exhaustion. Pure exhaustion. I fake my way through most of my day, everyday. Even when everything is going the way it’s supposed to, I’m sad and tired for no reason at all. My brain constantly reminds me that underneath the façade, I’m not alive in my shell. I go thru the motions, with the exception of giving genuine love. My fiancé, my kids, my family...they all are genuinely loved by me and the longer I deal with the numbness inside, the better I get at being compassionate and loving towards them. 

Minute by minute, I’m not living - I’m just existing. It’s exhausting to say the least. I wish I could sleep, but I’m too exhausted to sleep most of the time. There’s just no light at the end of this tunnel. 

THAT is my day to day."
No this is common among men especially. It also becomes a habit. I can’t fall asleep anymore without my white noise maker on. I used to do what you’re doing as well. Go check out the [/NoFap](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/)  subreddit. Sustaining from masturbation and especially the scourge of millennials aka porn can improve mood and confidence more than people realize.  When I first started NoFap I couldn’t sleep at all. This is just a symptom. Your body will adjust after not doing it for a week. Almost every male that’s stops masturbating after a day or two experiences this. If you have an addiction to porn or masturbation like 90% of males today then tell your therapist. That’s what he/she is there for. They will help you with this.
"Thank you! 

I’m fully aware that I DO suffer from depression, so I’m definitely not in denial or think that it’s entirely caused by these people or interactions with them... 

But I started paying attention to how I feel when I’m NOT around them (majority of the day) compared to how I feel when I AM around them and that’s what got me thinking... 

I’m more anxious when I’m home when they are... conversations with them leave me feeling extra sad... whereas I could be fine earlier in the day, feel like I’m making progress and on the right track and improving my state of mental health... comparing these two “states of being”’, which often occur in the same day, really put things into perspective. 

Thank you for your response! "
"Dealing with someone with depression is a big task....the first and the most important thing i would like to say is that ‘Just be there for her’....she would be feeling that nobody is by her side and everything wrong happens to her any maybe quite possibly for a reason...amidst all that chaos,she reached out to you,so don’t just push her away....is she hasn’t contacted a psychiatrist,lead her gently into that direction...dont push her...let her take things at her pace...just every day or two,tell her that going to a pdoc is not a bad thing and it would make things better....ask her about her day went...if she is interested in music,she should listen more songs...songs helped me a lot during my depression.....running is a very good activity and it releases endorphins and help a lot more than is evident from the mundaneness of it’s name....just show her that there are people who cares....you are a very nice human being for asking this and helping out you friend....godspeed to your friend..."
"Luckily I feel like I hit the jackpot with my first attempt.

I like my therapist because she listens and waits till I spill my whole perspective before interjecting. I am a fan of blunt honesty and unromanticisim. I'm very comfortable spilling everything and trying to make sense of the mess when I attend therapy. I don't feel like I have to hide anything necessary to my self improvement. She's also very experienced and qualified (25ish years) and always seems to ask the right questions and make the session insightful. 

I often don't like suggestions but insights. She seems to get this. I can tell she still loves her job and she's always very invested in *everything* I do, whether it's my body language, my tone, even how often I change my posture and how I manage my facial structure during the hour long sessions.

I was also lucky in a way that therapy is given for free where I live if you're a university student and you use their services. I doubt I could have found someone better even if I paid."
"Hey friend, first of all I’m sorry you’re experiencing this unfamiliar symptom. This can be real frustrating and frightening. 

It sounds to me like this is anxiety, like your doctor suggested. I don’t have “anxiety/panic” attacks in that I am totally overwhelmed by the physical sensations, but I’m quite familiar with other people’s experiences with them. It sounds like you’ve HAD anxiety for a while, but this is a whole new level - a change in the intensity and manifestation in terms of physiology. The way you describe the physical sensations sounds very similar to what I’ve heard anxious people say. 

I’ve had more minor levels of these symptoms now that I think about it. Definitely tightness in my chest like there’s a band around it. “The mind if a cornered animal” is exactly what anxiety is. It’s an adaptive survival response. You basically are an unreasoning animal in those moments. When I’m very anxious I cannot access higher level emotions consistently or appropriately. I often have tightness/headaches in my neck/head. 

I’m a bit worried that you are having intensified symptoms and that this deserves some more attention. Just don’t want you to hit a crisis point, as can happen with new symptoms/experiences. "
"Honestly, you might want to get involved with CPS because they can hook you up with all sorts of resources. Now, hear me out--I know it sucks having them in your life, but if you are so out of control as you fear, then help is needed and they can fast-track it for you. I doubt that they will take the child out of the home for this. There is no bruising, the child is not hurt, and you are seeking help. Believe me. I have had them in our life plenty of times to where the caseworker knows me very well and actually assisted us in getting bunk beds for our boys! They will do an assesment, see that there are no marks on the child, recommend counselling (and give you places that you can go for it), maybe have the case open for a while, and if you follow everything they say, they will close out the case and that is it. I recommend your wife also gets counselling...and the child, and the whole family as a unit.  


I am coming from a place of love with this, and experience. Having CPS in your life is not always a bad thing, and it took me forever and a day to realize that. Is it embarassing? Yes. Is it stressful? Yep. Is it the best thing for you? Absolutely. Good luck and please let me know how it goes ok? I hope you choose to get the help. &lt;3 Take care."
"&gt;  Doctors’ advice will be different in each patient’s case. 

Very true.  My half sister has mental health issues: hypochondria, separation anxiety, BPD, etc.  Her mother died in a mental institution back in the day.  Anecdotal, I know.

"
"Depression can be pretty brutal. Don't give up on medication, don't be afraid to tell your doctor if you think it's not working to try a different one, and always remember that what you might feel in the moment isn't what you'll be feeling later."
"Equine therapy is a cool option for kids. Sometimes it's hard for kids to get much from regular talk therapy, but alternative therapies like equine therapy or play therapy can be really helpful. See if there's anyone near you that provides that. "
Good for you to reach out and initiate therapy and not let the feelings of detachment stop you. Sounds like you've got a few layers going on in your life but no doubt you will get the guidance you need to help you through this time of your life.
"Honestly there are some duds out there. You will know when you find the one for you because it feels right, and when you leave you feel motivated. I had two which were quite horrible, one actually talked about herself in the sessions. Good luck. "
"Honestly, my anxiety just makes me insanely insecure and it makes me feel like im actually going crazy and then I pick at my hands and my face or I’ll start shaking like i did today and it was just horrible. I really felt like i was losing it. "
I experience similar things but mine is mainly due to ADHD and certain medications I take. Some of the examples you listed could be signs of a neurological disorder. Nothing’s set in stone though. I advise talking to a professional about this.
"I have been. Im on medication and i have a psychicatrist. Im trying to get into DBT.

My doctor didnt seem to think i did any permanent damage to myself but i hear there is this disorder called HPPD. 

I guess that can take a long time to go away"
"I have certain coping mechanisms that I can't do in a full time job, so I feel stressed the whole day. Then when I get back home I try to do everything else that drains my little remaining energy. Then I don't sleep well. All in all I feel awful."
"I have struggled with that for years. Even now typing this I am not even sure that my hands are mine or whether I am imagining things.

I kind of view it as if I am watching an advanced movie where you feel the sensations the character is having."
"I know some forms of tinnitus involve hearing music as if it were really there, and tinnitus is really common for people who are into music or are musicians. I have tinnitus but it's just a buzzing/ringing sound that sometimes can get very loud. "
"I've gotten random thoughts like that since high school. Only recently have they come with more frequency and intensity, but I've also recently been diagnosed with depression so perhaps that's why. 

No idea why they come , but you're not alone. "
"I've thought about this and was actually planning a trip overseas before I decided to do this. Maybe I'll stick around long enough for the trip since so many people have suggested it. If I don't like it, I'll have my pills and can go at any time."
"It's just I wish I could figure it out and solve it and I know I can't just do that. My heads a mess trying to pinpoint things, trace back, ect. I'm sorry you're going through that! Thank you! And i'm sending love your way as well. Hang in there!"
"No one can diagnose you on here based on a few paragraphs. If you really want an official diagnosis you'd need to see a psychiatrist. Honestly, it sounds like the normal range of emotions you're experiencing but I'd see a professional. Good luck!"
"Okay I'll try that! Hopefully sorting by insurance has all the ones in my network, not sure how that works or if I have to go back and forth between the site and my network list! But having one specific website instead of I don't know what helps!"
"Thanks!! 

I hadn’t read that... only that mixing it with an SSRI can produce serotonin syndrome! 

I’ve been taking everything for about 2 months now, and haven’t experienced anything crazy... but I’ll be sure to pay closer attention :) "
"That's not really dissociation. It sounds more like possibly an emotional or borderline personality issue. 

As for remembering things - is it because you just weren't present when things happened or you really have a hard time remembering stuff?"
"Then no, she is definitely quite capable of feeling like she deserves love and joy as well as feeling them without me.  I built myself around her because of my fucked up attachment issues and refusL to acknowledge that I also need to be a person."
"You’re not wasting people’s time. Just because you’re not miserable every moment of every day doesn’t mean that you’re not mentally ill.
I would just be really honest about your feelings and about your vacation when you see your doctor."
"As to why you like it more, that’s a personal thing. Probably your brain responding to the reaction, this taste = this reaction. When your brain has increased levels of dopamine, it causes it to have a sobering effect, similar to how if you were to ingest something like meth while you were drunk, they would cancel each other out. There’s a lot of science behind it, there’s not really a simple answer. When your brain is in a manic state, it’s “too” focused, making you think erratically "
"I doubt that's why they want you back in work. The theory goes that, all else being equal, being in work is a good thing, you are getting out, interacting, practicing coping skills in real life situs, earning more than you'd get on benefit, maybe get self esteem from doing or achieving. Etc etc. Of course if your work is a major factor in your ill health then perhaps it's not so therapeutic.  I was out for 4/5 months and only back now 1/3 time. But they were very keen on my going back throughout. "

"NP. My disorder is actually under Impulse Control Disorder, but it is related very closely to OCD since it is an obsession and compulsions. The only problem is that if I let my compulsions run wild, I could possibly get arrested for malicious destruction of property, even if I don't INTEND to cause such damage. I could hurt someone possibly, and that is what is scary about this thing. :( I try my best to control the damn thing. Days like today, it went a little wild, but I had it on a short leash."
"Sounds like a little touch of possible depression mixed with teen angst and hormones, but I can't really say for sure. I would approach a Therapist about this, and be honest and open about everything you're going through. I have the same problem--I have to find a Therapist and tell him/her everything that I have been doing, and some of it I really don't want to divulge because I am afraid I will be ""locked away"" again.   


I wish you luck and I hope you can figure this out. :) Message me anytime!"
"Thank you so much..  I wonder if an otherwise harmless cult becomes abusive and destructive when a member is both trapped by the worldview of the cult but also not able to conform or benefit from that worldview.  Then you become ""against them"" while still being trapped in the belief with nowhere else to go....this can create existential stress/terror/torment.  Essentially, at that point...you only have two options....to *pretend* you are benefiting from the worldview or get shunned by the group.  "
"This might not be entirely helpful but my anxiety presents as anger when I get overstressed. Any chance you can take a day off soon? I started dedicating an hour a day to do something for me. Sticking to it has been helpful. I know people preach self care but it is important. You come before work dear. But if this continues, I would encourage you to look for free counseling resources, they exist in some places. I'm sorry I'm not more helpful. I'm sort of in a rut myself.... sending you good vibes!"
"Yeah I’d say it’s pretty bad. Getting this upset over a speeding ticket isn’t normal so I’m assuming it’s not really the speeding ticket that’s bothering you. Life is full of minor inconveniences and most people are able to just accept that, and move on. If you can’t you’re probably depressed or have some sort of unresolved anger inside of you that’s making you angry at the entire world. I’d suggest talking to someone. Have you ever thought of going to some sort of counseling? "
"I have had a similar problem- although full transparency I'm not 100% sure it's bc of my meds  (I've been on venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine). 

I haven't found a method to completely fix the issue but I have found that limiting the times I am looking at and reading on screens to help- not even necessarily cutting back completely, but making sure I take consistent and intentional 10-15 minute break to do some eye exercises to reduce strain and blurriness. 

I do the same with general reading as well, basically any time I've been spending extended uninterrupted amounts of time where my eyes have to focus. 

I don't if this helps at all but I hope either way you find a fix, I know how incredibly frustrating it is. sending good thoughts your way ��"
"I suffer from BPD, depression, and anxiety. The stigma that goes with personality disorders is disheartening. Many may disagree with me, but wouldn't it be nice if mental illness was perceived like any other illness. If someone is suffering from cancer they are looked at as ""oh I am so sorry to hear that"". If someone is suffering from borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, psychotic disorders etc...they are feared, avoided, or called crazy. When those with mental illness are suffering just as much as someone with a physical ailment. Anxiety and depression are becoming more widely ""accepted""  but yes I agree with the OP that other ""mental illnesses"" are being pushed aside, and those that have them are somewhat ostracized and misunderstood. "
"To act on your realization, you have two options. Positive thinking or uncertainty. Positive thinking is certainty, just like pessimism. Using positive thinking is feeling great when meeting a girl, but when she doesn’t respond for an hour you spend an hour in confusion and worry, trying to tell yourself it’ll be ok. Could go on and on, but let’s skip forward to uncertainty. The unknown is pretty scary. But once you live there, you’ll see it is the easiest, most comfortable, fewest effort requiring place there is. You take the next step. Since you are your best self, you’ll probably win. You might lose or even die, but that’s fine - because you’ll die without regrets in that case.  Don’t make success a goal, it’s only another trap"
"thank you.  Yeah, I'm not sure I've ever tried the CBT.  If I have, I didn't realize that's what they were doing.  Unfortunately, the counselor I want doesn't take my insurance at all and I can't afford to pay anything more than a modest co=pay even with being reimbursed.  

But tomorrow my boyfriend has off work and he's going to help me get it worked out and find a counselor.  Yeah, he's a gem.  A keeper for sure.   I'm looking into trauma counseling and CBT too.  

I'm glad for this thread.  It gives me some hope to just talk about things like this and have a plan.  I realize that when I'm not moving in a direction, however slowly, then I feel REALLY depressed.  But even a step forward helps my moods.  I appreciate all the feedback.  tyvm again."
"Depression does make you feel like you've lost yourself sometimes. And it changes your perception on the world to be a much bleaker place, so if your depression is bad enough sometimes you just start losing traction on your actions a bit. It doesn't morally justify anything, and you still have to take responsibility for your actions, but it is awful to have done something and think fuck I wouldn't have done that if I was mentally healthy why have I done that.

When your boyfriend says he is cripplingly sorry and feels detached from his actions, I 100% believe him. I've been there. But that doesn't oblige you to forgive him. It's hard when you love someone, but if you can't get over this, and it will negatively affect you having to live with him knowing he's done that, then you have every right to decline that sorrow. Even if someone is fragile and sorry, responsibility is still theirs and you are the one who is important and calls the shots in this situation.

I hope you find a happy choice, friend."
"I recommend going to a licensed psychologist, and a psuchaotrist as well. 


There are a lot of ""mental health professionals"" who aren't trained, schooled, or prepares to handle cases that they take on any ways. Lincesed clinical social workers (lcsw/lmsw), mental health counselor (lmhc), occupational therapists, industrial/io psychologists, and the even worse off ""sex therapists"" or life coaches, etc. Are all trained significantly less than psychologists and are not supposed to take on cases that are more advanced then general adjustment and have legitimate mental health diagnoses. But because of the state of healthcare and insurance in our company these people end up taking on way more advanced cases then they should be.

You can find those with a phd or psyd in clinical psychology who have earned the title and license of psychologist online and view their orientation and specialization if any. 

I suggest seeking a therapist that is more qualified and with more an idea of what you are looking for"
"I kinda know what you mean. I work on the SuperStars, which is customer service for a very well-known gaming company. We go to their website and answer questions from the players (they have several games, and now it is basically me and another lady working all of them) and pass on information to the Admins, who take it to the Developers/Studio. It is hard work and I get yelled at and told that (the company) is worthless and is just trying to cheat the players out of money (you can buy items in-game to help yourself along), and sometimes the players are just so annoying and stupid even that it gets to me. I have to force myself to not write ""well, if you don't like it GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"" to them. I feel ya bud. Customer Service is a bitch sometimes, but like you, I also get a lot of sweet players who actually thank me for helping them. That keeps me coming back, even though I get frustrated as hell. I have to step away from the computer a lot of the time during the day (I work from home also and have no set hours or even a set schedule--I pretty much do how much I want, when I want, though I do try to do some every day) because I get a headache dealing with the morons and rude people.   


Hang in there. If you need comic relief, just message me. :D"
"Well a cry for help is proof that you don't want to end it, and I congratulate you for it. The problem is you can't go on without help. So you're gonna have to spend 10 days in a behavioural health unit. 

I attempted suicide at 16, and have hospitalized myself 3 times in the last 5 years. So I know what you are going through.  The human body is an incredible piece of machinery, but sometimes it needs a tune up. The mind is a tricky one. So you need to the right tools to get through what you're going through. You need to spend some time dealing with this full time. Forget all your responsibilities for a couple weeks and work on getting your mind and body physically, mentally, and spirtually ready to tackle your other issues. 

Call an uber and have them take you to the nearest hospital. Pack some comfortable cloths, shoes, (preferably with no laces) take a book. Let a loved one know where you are going, so they can call your work and handle things while you are gone. Bring some cash in case you need it to make calls/vending machines. 

You need to get on some meds, and a few group therpy lessons on life coping skills. 

I'm going to stay awake waiting for a response from you so please respond. I can send you my number if you need someone to talk to. "
"Awww. I understand that. You really gotta open up, which is almost impossible it seems sometimes. I hope you keep going and are brutally honest with the therapist. That way, they can help you to help yourself to heal. I send lots of love your way."
"Dude, just by looking at your post history it's pretty obvious that you generalize people with BPD as a whole. Your first post is literally a video called ""how to tame your borderline"" that's fucking dehumanizing. What do you even gain from this? "
"Good for you, I know it's difficult. 
I struggled to quit drinking for 5 years. I finally made it happen this year after trying to quit 50+ times, and I don't look back at all. Alcohol is the worst drug I've ever done, and I've tried them all. 


"
"Haha I totally get it! I posted this on my Facebook page and I doubt many will even take the time to read it. Which is fine. You are right, if all the small voices do their part, we are loud together. And we can make an impact. Keep on educating! "
"I actually feel like this today... 

I’m stressed tho but I just came out of the car and on my way here I thought “damn... it would be really nice to just die.. can’t a accident just happen where I die now?” And so on. Still feeling down. "
"I had a similar experience when I first started but it only lasted a week or two. It’s just as if, you can feel something is different, a sort of buzz? I also felt sick for about a week and that went away too, probably just getting used to them!"
I know but it's difficult. You really do have to get lucky. Internet isn't actually that great in my experience. Dating websites are barely usable thanks to pay walls. And I find it very difficult to get involved in social circles on social media.
"I struggle with rapid cycle bi-polar 2. If these episodes persist a lot. See a professional for guidance. You may have to try different medications that work for you, talk therapy to find the root of the problem can help or find the real problem.

"Is there another physical activity outside the gym you could do together? 

Or, maybe you could check out a new class together at your gym. Gives you guys a new experience there.

"Just a constant obsession with having some undiagnosed medical condition that was gonna kill me, and being pretty much absolutely certain that I was going to die from it (which led to a lot of panic attacks, insomnia, and other anxiety symptoms). "
"Me too. I wish all the best for you. Ah, to be 26 again. I can't even remember 26 (hardly) ha ha. I was drinking pretty heavily then so ages 20-28 are a blur of drunken nights, hungover sick days and no memories. I am sending another hug your way!"
"My biggest fear in life is being alone, yet I have no ability to open up and do what I need to do to keep people close. Even with a wife and three kids, it still feels easier to drive them away than fight to keep the love and energy in all of it. "
"Not an expert by no means but when the people next door start arguing or being loud try to get her to listen to some music via headphones or earphones to drain out the noise, I have paranoid thoughts sometimes and this helps in similar situations "
"Possibly the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I'll type out a message, that to think about every single reply she could give and how anything I have to say at this point is only gonna push her away cause I'm not allowing her the space she needs."
There's nothing wrong with being on medication. I've been on meds since last year. But I can't force you to do it either. Just make sure that you're completely honest with your therapist. You need to tell them exactly what you've told us on here.
This is completely up to you. But I would recommend seeing your doctor as soon as possible. 12 days is still a pretty long time to wait. It would probably be in your best interest to talk to them before your next appointment. So keep that in mind.
"To be fair, there could be practitioners out there skilled in both modalities. Its not like therapists can only have one skill set and thats it. Not disagreeing with anything you said, just that it may be possible to do both with the same person. "
Try a shelter if your under 25 then a youth shelter will help you get on your feet and find a way to help you plan out your immediate life and some possible futures. Also go somewhere like city hall and ask them about what to do in your situation.
We'll keep this post and remember I feel it too! The moments when it's easier to suffer alone than have to explain what you don't understand! Just remember it won't last forever and tomorrow is a new day. Now you have someone else who understands!
"Well I doubt it’s because of school, I’ve had it since I was 5. I started to think it was a strange form of PTSD but, the symptoms of Asperger do sound like what I have. I’ll ask a doctor or something next time I go. Thanks for your help. ^^"
"Wolfsangel-Dragon,
I was reading your comments and you are very inspiring and real with people. 
I am often like that too but not so much for myself. Thanks for your words and if you have more wisdom I’m open to it. Smoking up never helped me ;)"
"I got better.  I was very unhappy, crying daily, breaking down in the supermarket,  just awful and the future was just bleak. so i basically changed everything.  Sold my shit, quit my job and took an insane paycut to move overseas. I realise now my depression was caused by a life that didn't suit me rather than my brain. I dont know but maybe your grad programme just isnt for you and that's okay. Something else will be. Just reading over my diary from earlier this year to now is like night and day."
"I have this issue and maybe didn’t even realise it until my therapist brought it up.
When I’m talking to her she will stop me and ask me how I’m feeling. Im usually unsure sometimes but sometimes it does help me and I’m able to verbalise how I’m feeling.
So I need to try and do this more in day to day life for a start, not sure what else will help yet but I’m hoping with time things will improve.
So I’d definitely recommend trying that and talking to someone professionally if you can "
"I think the best thing to do would be to recognize that you view things in a different way now and just move forward from it. You can’t change the past but therapy is supposed to help you prevent repeating the same destructive or unhealthy patterns. So now that you know what you do, you can work to change it if you don’t like it or if it’s detrimental to your life. Try to see this as an opportunity to change and fix things rather than beat yourself up for past mistakes you can longer change. "
"If you were numb before, it could be that the meds actually cleared the numbness, which was probably the coping mechanism that protected you from extreme emotions. Are you in any sort of therapy that could help you with emotional regulation? I for example do DBT.

Of course, it's also possible that maybe these meds are not the right choice for you. If you're able to wait til the appointment, do so, but if not, try to reschedule it for earlier. I would definitely consult the psychiatrist. Take care!"
"Thanks death. I was just speaking to someone from this page as a mentor. I hope I helped. This is a good thing you are doing. Mental health is no joke. I’m also open to PMs if anyone needs to talk. Same deal death offered. No judgment, just sharing ideas that worked for me. Depression and mental illness has taken people impertinent from my life. All of you reading, take me or him up on this offer. We’re here to help as best as we can. Good night to all and hope the best for anyone reading this."
"That’s really awesome of you! I know that my ex’s family pressured me to stay with him, despite him being abusive and throwing around suicide threats a lot. I guarantee that if he’d attempted or succeeded, they would have blamed me- it’s really nice to see that not all parents are like that. It sounds like you have a really solid head on your shoulders and are approaching this situation as well as anyone could, and I wish you luck. I hope your son finds peace and contentment sometime soon. "
"Yes. Been doing it much of my life. Also starting to happen publically. Just to let you know, no you're not the only one. It is helpful for me to read of others who are self-aware enough to ask for relativity &amp; support, who are plagued by intrusive thoughts and vocalized exhaust. That's all the mutterings &amp;/or ranting is to me- exhaust that we have to vent or it is just too much.  I think it's an innocuous thing if one is (mostly) grounded in what is actually going on rather than delusions."
"I hope this is a troll post, but just in case it’s not. 

Not only is that not “normal” it is assault/sexual assault which is illegal and could one day land you in jail. To be honest, I hope it does. Women as a whole do not owe you anything because one woman upset you (and that woman likely owes you, at most, an apology, and possibly not even that). 

If you are in any way distressed about this behavior, and want to change it, since you are posting here, I would strongly suggest that you find some very good professional help to help you work through your hatred of women (and minorities, judging by your history) and your anger issues and violent tendencies. 

Otherwise, like I said, I hope you are arrested for the safety of those in your area. "
"I’ve had the same realization. After getting fired from my job I completely shut down for the last 10 months. I didn’t really leave my room, get out of bed, or eat healthy. My boyfriend and I ordered a lot of delivery food and junk food. I gained about 30 lbs in the process and my self esteem plummeted, my depression worsened, and my anxiety grew. In the past month and a half, I’ve stopped eating junk and ordering delivery. I’ve started cooking with fresh vegetables and drinking tea instead of soda. I also started running again, and have lost about 8 lbs. I’ve never felt so great. My depression and anxiety have all but faded into the background. 

Our physical health has a LOT to do with our mental health. They’re definitely correlated. "

"Ultimately, nobody who matters cares about your sexuality. Regardless of whether you're heterosexual, homosexual or otherwise. If you're happy in your skin, that's attractive. Being stood up three times in a row is garbage- being stood up on Tinder/OKC/any other app or service is to be expected. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be hard on people making mistakes, nobody will ever remember the mistakes you made around them. Everyone goes home and analyzes what they said in the shower, not what was said to them.

"&gt; ""Hey, check out this sub about mental health! Lets be an asshole to someone setting aside their pride and self image out of concern for the well being of others!""

I'll talk about this quote first, then go back to your original post and talk about the common thread here.

This quote you gave, which you made up out of thin air, you're grossly over-exaggerating what reality is, changing my vague comment into an over-dramatic narrative. You personally attack me, calling me an asshole, then position yourself as a martyr ""setting aside [your] pride and self-image"".

And it makes sense, hastily attacking me, twisting what I said. Just like you take an article, an article less than 48 hours old, an article by a publication that has no expertise in the domain of mental health, or technology, an article with no response from Apple, an article where no doctors or mental health professionals were consulted, an article that you didn't post to get the opinion of r/AskDocs, or r/askpsychology, and going off this complete non-scientific, non-researched article claim that this warrants the following action:

&gt; if you were only once in your life going to worry about the well being of the people around you, now (and even after) is the time to be worried

To paraphrase, the iPhone XS making people look better in their photos is THE ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE to worry about the well being of others? The one time? More than depression, homelessness, the failing of our government, drug addiction, social media addiction, etc. The one time, before ANY DATA, response, research, doctor, psychologist, etc. has been gathered whatsoever in regards to a less than 48-hour old article by a pub with no expertise in these domains.

This is inappropriate. This is resembling hysteria.

"It’s certainly possible that the report was lost, which is obviously frustrating and inconvenient. I’d be incredibly upset ana angry and all that fun stuff if that happened to me. Sometimes mistakes happen though. 

Alternatively, there is a chance that the report just isn’t ready yet. Generally initial psychiatric/psychological reports are quite in depth, and in my experience, it’s often slow getting the report. And maybe the provider you saw in the ER, is still referencing the original report to write their own report from your visit. 

No matter the reason, I would try contacting the ER or that hospital,s medical records department (or get your psychiatrist to request it) to see if something is started but not finalized or something. 

I had an experience where I had a pre-research study psychiatric assessment, and it took that doctor 8-9 months to get that report written and then sent to my general psychiatrist and GP. I sent the research centre a ton of emails asking about the status of the report. I think it ended up being  8-9 pages. But also apparently, his original administrative assistant left and it took them a while to find a new one (and she was responsible for transcribing the report from the dictation). 

All that to say, you’re well within your right to be frustrated and upset. This is very inconvenient. But it’s always possible that the report from your ER visit just isn’t ready yet. But there is a chance that someone somewhere goofed. 

Also, I’m not sure if it’s relevant or not, but I work in health care. We refer a lot of kids to psychiatrists and psychologists and those reports often take more time to be written and sent than other specialties.  

Am on mobile, sorry I apologize for formatting and spelling issues. "
"&gt; You are basically saying everyone who uses mindfulness techniques is stupid 

Nope.  It looks like you're projecting.  Which is also something I've noticed mindfulness-pushers to be fond of, come to think.

Still marking this as a ""called it."""

My life is mostly positive these days, I have a job now supporting those in the exact situations I was in and have received help for my trauma and anxiety. 

Your well wishes are appreciated! I wish the same for you and your sister :) "
"Being a parent isn't easy. 

Do you lose out on anything by taking your dad up on the offer to spend time together? Probably not... He may be trying to grow a relationship that he acknowledges isn't very strong. 

Life is short. Give him a chance. "
Go see a therapist. That's where you should start. A therapist will allow you to go into much more depth about your issues than a psychiatrist will. You need to have regular visits. You have to talk about your problems before you can overcome them.
"I agree with that completely!! I just wish that it was easier to cut them off, or at least adopt a more stand off-ish mentality without feeling immense guilt or turning into a complete b*tch and making matters worse! 

Thank you for your response! "
"I don't think you did anything wrong. Just the next time, make sure you are somewhere nobody else can hear you. Not because it's something ""naughty"" but because it's something private, or just because that's part of the joy of working in an office."
I have this too :( rapid mood swings the least thing can set me off. I think I have borderline personality disorder but not sure. Sometimes it’s exhausting I get so enraged I can’t see straight and later I’m like damn what’s wrong with me.

"Just to put your mind at ease, it's probably no big deal!  It's just that your doctor should know the side effects and may want to switch SSRIs or give you a different dosage schedule (start with 1mg for five days, then 2, etc.)

Therapists are here to help you understand you are ok. A lot of times we forget that we are all valuable individuals and that we are important. The difficulties we are going through in life we can handle. Therapists are there to remind you of that.
juvenile psychiatry should be illegal. period. Kids are not complicated they have a home and a school and maybe some peer age friends. Yet they can get fucked with all the blame for whatever imaginary bullshit problems their parents think they have
"Hey there. I can see you are concerned about this. If you would like to know more about the ethics of sexual fantasy (when its ok, when its not ok, and how to manage it ethically, whats normal, whats abnormal, and the extent that matters).

There you will find sex workers, therapists, researchers, and other educated, experienced and knowledgeable community members who will be happy to help."
"I'm 26 f and my therapist is 29 f and for me, the age closeness makes me much more comfortable with her and able to talk about things.

Maybe if you give it a chance you'll see a benefit in having someone in your age range to confide in. If not I'd tell her honestly and move on. "

I wouldn’t have motivation to do anything either if I were married to someone who belittled me constantly and had no compassion for what I’m struggling with. I’m really sorry you have to deal with that on a regular basis. I think you should talk to you doctor about the medication because it may not be the best one for you if you have no energy like this. I’m on a medication too, but I feel so much motivation now that I’m on it. Best of luck!"
"\&gt;  And its frustrating how not over thinking everything and just being in the moment comes so naturally for people.

not proselytizing, but I have a similar thing and I find /r/buddhsim really helpful. mainly because it has a really robust, useful, practical notion of *what a self actually is.* Its also great for mindfulness techniques. Absolutely nothing to do with 'religion' in making this suggestion - its more of a point of philosophy that Ive found very helpful in this regard."
"the thing is,now a days my only motivation in life is wanting to watch the world crumble,and no matter what i do i cant fill the void,my parents are very religous and they constantly tell me my reason in life yet despite being surronded by that thought proceses im here instead and i find the only thing that seems to make me somewhat happy or fulfilled is back stabbing people or ruining someones life but i dont want to do that.

its just,im so torn apart within

and thank you for trying to help &lt;3"
"therapy is gonna be uncomfortable because it's going to force you to be brutally honest with yourself. We all have things we'd rather pretend didn't happen or wasn't a part of us, but we can't really force that to go away. So just know, youre not fucked up, youre just trying to connect with the real you. It is going to be overwhelming so make sure your therapist also has tools to help you wind down from the emotional turbulence afterwards. Good luck in therapy, i'm sure it wasn't easy to begin with!"
"there's something severe there if its just not you. I believe in healing and help and I believe he needs mental help. I was going to mention psychotic disorder but I forgot, oops. mental illness is complex though and it could be a multitude of things. 

keep yourself safe. while I haven't been in a severe abusive relationship, I've seen the nasty sides of emotional abuse. I've seen bipolar disorder and nasty anger. I believe he needs severe help. 

stay safe, i send all the positive thoughts I can. "
"I find it nearly impossible to properly express how I'm feeling. If I describe it metaphorically, I get called dramatic. If I describe it physically, I'm not believed. 

If I get into an argument with a friend, when I do manage to explain how I'm feeling, why I'm feeling that way, and how that's affected my decision making, the other person suddenly goes, ""Jesus, not everything is about you."" I don't think I so much as implied it was. I was just explaining my side of things and why I might've done what I did.

But because my decision making isn't entirely cogent anymore, they doubt my sincerity and give me a new analysis of my behaviour and force upon me a motivation I didn't even know I had. 

I now feel like the unreliable narrator of my own story."
"How long have you been dealing with these feelings? And have you been to a someone who specializes in these things(Psychiatrist, Psychologist, Social Worker)?

Depression and Self Harm is not nothing, and going to professional for consultation is a good idea. 

My dad went through depression when he was younger and my brother and I are currently dealing with it. My dad's advice for therapy for depress was Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). 

I was not diagnosed with anything for most of my life but recently due to a stressful situation last school year symptoms started arising. 

It sounds like you are in some serious pain, though I don't know you situation. If you are able too  go see a mental health professional.

I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes but life is worth living and it does get better, but you need to take action for yourself in order for it to do so. Trust me when my depression was at its worst I felt like I was going to be stuck like that forever. 

Good luck and I wish you well!"
"With your current headspace and seeking drugs as your only escape, I don't know if you will make it through the next 4 years of school. Think of it like energy, you have renewable energy and non-renewable energy. Getting through life relying on drugs might work for a while, but it gets expensive and eventually will break you down rather than keep you going. You need some clean energy from a renewable source, friends, other family, hobbies, maybe a job you enjoy so you aren't so reliant on this woman. 

You talked about being sent to a pysch war in the past, well this lifestyle that you are setting yourself up for will almost certainly land you back there, and also probably drug treatment. You need to rely on yourself and on people and activities you trust. Your mom is obviously a drain, and the drugs will be too. Shit stinks, and if you don't work to get out of it, your still standing in shit. There are times to stick it out and there are times to make a change, and I think you need to make a change. "
"It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of suffering, I'm glad that you're seeking help. 

I just want to pick out a couple of things from your post:

&gt; 10 years later, I am terrified of big pointy kitchen knives. When one is laying out, I immediately think of either cutting myself or stabbing my wife. I usually panic and either turn my back to it or just walk out of the room. It's especially destressing when my wife is sitting down to eat a meal with a steak knife and the thought of stabbing her in the chest comes to mind and I have to leave the room mid-sentence. 

These are thoughts. Thoughts are neither good or bad, they are just thoughts. Our thoughts don't cause harm to others. Having violent thoughts doesn't make you a violent person. We aren't defined by our thoughts. You should have a read of /r/intrusivethoughts if you haven't already. Hopefully it will help. The thing about intrusive thoughts is that the more we try to fight them the more intense and regular they become. 

&gt; I felt like a very irritable, arrogant and easily-aggitated person 
&gt; I've become totally withdrawn and selfish over the past 5 years, and don't really want to be social with anyone unless I have to 

These statements match up with symptoms of depression imo.

"
"Maybe you could set up a journal to keep track of your ups and downs? Just a sentence or two to record how you're feeling, for reference. You don't even need to record every day. Journaling helps me deal with downswings and I naturally want to write about how great I feel during upswings, so my journal is more a map of the extreme ends of my moods. Still helpful though. My mood swings are due to my depression and anxiety, but the principle remains the same regardless of what's causing them, I think.

Exercise can definitely help with stabilizing moods (or at least it has for me), so it's not a bad suggestion, but if the swings are extreme then it might not be the whole solution either. I'd still recommend regular exercise and a balanced diet.

I'd also look into seeing a psychologist and talk to them explicitly about your concern with your mood swings. Having a journal will help you here, since you will have concrete lengths of the swings and the way you feel during every entry. Going into therapy with a set goal will help the therapist better treat you.

Additionally, recording your feelings means that you have a reminder of how good you can feel even during your lowest lows, and lets you look at your lows in a new light once you are on a high again. "
"You're not overreacting! You're a human and you witnessed something deeply humanly heartbreaking, it is natural to feel strongly, it just means you are empathetic. That being said, it's also really good that you recognize that your feelings are not the priority / the family's heartbreak comes first. I would advise talking to a neutral third party, Idk what sort of resources are available in Canada but maybe like, whatever the step down from a suicide hotline is? Just somebody to talk to. Someone recently recommended the website 7 cups to me, I haven't tried it yet but it's built to chat with supportive strangers, maybe you could try to process it there? Posting about it more here is also fine! Just getting out what you're feeling will probably help a little.
I don't know if you watch The Good Place but the episode where Michael learns about death and they talk about how humans live with that reality all the time- it always sticks with me. There's so much going on day to day that most of us aren't really coping with the existential terror of just being alive - witnessing a tragedy, even when it doesn't affect us personally, can force us to think about death in ways that are scary! 
I hope you're able to work it out, I'm sorry you witnessed that moment! "
"First, thanks for responding. I appreciate it.

For context, I have three sons and the oldest is your age. I have dealt with anxiety and depression issues for decades. I suffered emotional abuse as a child and have been unhappy for most of my life for one reason or another. It is only in the last few years that I have really started to turn the corner.

&gt; I've seen a psychiatrist a few times a while ago, which is how I have this diagnosis. I've never seen anyone for anything else though. I declined her appointments so they took me off the list. I called her once this idea of suicide went from just a thought to a possibility a month ago, and she put me on the waiting list. Not messing with you, my appointment is in six months. I will not say where I live, let's just say our health care system can be a joke at times.

That's disappointing. But you should call back and make clear that you have moved from ideation to actually planning to take your life. They will get you in. If they can't, you should call a hotline. If you can't get anywhere there, contact me and we'll figure something out.

I am not sure where you are located though. I'm in the US, where ""health care system can be a joke"" certainly applies, so maybe you are too.

There is help available. You need to get it.

&gt; Referring to what you said about this being normal and common, I'm not unhappy. This is a consistent boredom and void of enjoyment I've had my entire life. I'm extremely emotionally stable. Very little upsets me, and when I'm upset, it goes back to neutral very quickly. The downside being nothing makes me happy or excited. 

These are feelings many people experience, especially when young, and they are not necessarily permanent. You have a significant untreated condition, so you are not in a place where you can make decisions with full information right now. 

&gt; I'm almost 25 and it's been this consistently bland my entire life, you could see where I'm coming from not expecting anything to change. It's not that I haven't tried, I have, every thing I could think of. I've literally had years upon years to think about this and try new things, nothing helps and I'd be an idiot to think it would past this point.

I don't want to deny your experience. I won't say that you don't have reasons to feel hopeless or like anything will change. I won't tell you to ignore those feelings and I have no intention to patronize you.

But I can speak to you as someone who is looking back on 25 through a lens of almost three decades. And I can tell you with CERTAINTY that you have no idea yet just how much life can change. And it doesn't necessarily take 30 years. 

There have been times in my life when I too thought nothing would ever change, that it was hopeless, that I would always be the way I was. And I was wrong.

With the right tools and assistance, you can make significant changes and possibly resolve much of the difficulty you are dealing with now.

I would never counsel suicide in any situation due to mental illness, but it is especially troublesome when you haven't even had a chance to get help yet. Please, get that help. I am not a psychiatrist but there are people out there who can assist you.

At least try to get some proper advice and help before you make a decision that cannot be unmade."
" \&gt;My mom has depression, anxiety, self esteem issues and she’s attempted suicide before. My dad might just have depression. 

Well that explains a lot.

\&gt; No I’ve never been to therapy. 

You probably should, it'd probably work for you. "
"Borderline personality certainly comes to mind because of the fear of abandonment, extreme emotions, suicidal thoughts and self harm (starving self).  
Maybe get her a new psychiatric evaluation with psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner.  "
"I am in therapy and I like my therapist. He is great. I've only seen him a couple times and he's awesome. It's all what you make of it. You need to be able to connect with the person. If you don't, then you won't feel comfortable opening up to them."
I totally understand why you have developed that as a coping mechanism. I really hope you get some helpful replies and get some answers. I just wanted to comment to let you know that you are not alone no matter what you are dealing with. Good luck.
"I'm 50, and mental health issues at this age are a bit different than, say, When you are 17. Peoples outlook and experience change as they get older. Some people prefer to talk about that with others in a similar boat. No one is segregating anyone. "
It's normal for someone who is this verbally abusive to eventually escalate to physical abuse. Honestly if he is refusing to see a therapist that's equivalent to refusing to stop behaving abusively. You deserve better than that from a relationship.
"My cat is an ESA, doesn't mean I want to force thag on my friends if I stay on their couch. Nowhere nearby is cheap enough or nearby enough to make things work. I don't want to sacrifice any more of my life, it's just not fair. I just want him gone."
"Nah, he's a tool. One of my coworkers was in the hospital last week and when I brought this up with my boss, my boss scowled and said ""we're going to have to do something about that, it's becoming an issue."" Like, the guy's sick...in the hospital..."
"Oh and remember to enjoy whatever you can enjoy in everyday life. It's ok to feel down, even if it's most of the time, but that doesn't mean you can't allow yourself to enjoy anything at all.

Whatever is enjoyable, make the most out of those things"
"Past few years I've sort of come to the conclusion that my anxiety has always been way worse than I thought and that was what was fueling my depression. I'd recommend considering psychiatry, even just to learn about options. Sending you best wishes "
"You need to find something to occupy your time that's productive. If you truly want to get in shape, then working out is a great coping method. Just remember that it takes time to see results. So don't give up at first if you don't see any progress."
"You're being... well... paranoid. And the irony is that the illness you're being treated for is potentially interfering with your treatment.

You should address your concerns to your therapist, since they are at the core of your issue to begin with."
"yep! consistently every night and about the same handful of things. but i'm not afraid to sleep. i need to sleep. it would be fantastic if i didn't, because nightmares fucking suck. but, alas.

i'm pretty sure it's a side effect of anti depressants."
"A lot of people with similar issues think that way. I do a lot of the time. I don't mean this offensively but I'm guessing you're quite self critical? I've had times where I completely felt that way, when I was in hospital I was paranoid that I'd faked my symptoms to sound worse even though I hadn't. I know it's difficult but try not to think about what hasn't happened to you. You have depression and you fully deserve help for it. You deserve to feel better and you deserve to find ways to manage it. "
"Completely understand this, and its something to work on, for sure. Really glad to see you're posting about it and trying to figure it out. It must be really horrible feeling like that. 

I dont know if it would work for you, but 'metta' meditation could actually be very good at reversing this. Would take some time, but could be very effective. The whole thing that buddhists do is wish for others to be happy. Its kind of core to their beliefs. 

Whatever you do / decide, I hope you find your answer. "
"I don't know, most people seem to think that suicide is always a bad and irrational decision, but I don't feel that way. I just don't want to live like this and I know that if someone asked me year ago (when I was pretty happy with my life) if I'd want to live with these symptoms for the rest of my life or rather die, I'd say that I'd rather die.

I'm going to try everything I can to get rid of this, but if I won't find anything, I'd prefer death over having to live like this for the rest of my life."
"I feel that I can relate to you. I used to always lash out and snap at my family whenever they would do something to irritate me. My advice to you would be to seek out help and if you haven't already try out some form of antidepressant.

Ever since I started taking medicine (escitalopram) my mood has stabilized substantially and my outbursts have stopped. Asking for help is the first big step towards getting better and you have your family supporting you. Feel free to pm me if you have any questions."
"I’ve been on a few different meds for anxiety and depression. None of them made me fake happy, or happy at all. They help keep me calm and rational when I otherwise wouldn’t be, and there are parts of my life I wouldn’t have been able to get through without both meds and therapy. That’s just me, of course, but the meds helped a lot and I’m hoping to get back on something soon because I have a tendency to hurt myself when I get overwhelmed, which happens a lot more when I’m not medicated. "
"PLEASE FIND ANOTHER JOB. Sorry for yelling. But seriously do not blame yourself for how sucky your job is making you feel. You’d just get sucked deeper and deeper into the black hole. 

Please find a new job ASAP. Do not allow your job to damage your emotional health any longer. Seeing a psychiatrist, or taking meds will not help much if you’re constantly in a toxic environment. I’ve been in your position before. It takes time and experience to find a healthy work environment. Don’t give up. "
"why don;t you directly ask him what caused him to be that upset to the point of tears? You do seem to care about the answer as you put this post up.   
when someone is depressed - its common for them to also be hyper sensitive too. (at least was the case for me and other depressed people I've talked to) so while it may seem silly to you that he would get upset to that extent ...to him he may have had many negative thoughts swirling in his mind about being excluded and felt lots of real pain from it. "
"I can relate. And at my worst moments I feel like nothing could be worse. I really honestly believe it at those moments with all my heart. Because I feel like my brain is torturing me. It technically is. But shit can always get worse. Also, some people can't do crap about the burden they carry or the hurdles they face. We can.

I just find it upsetting that mental illness is surrounded by stigma and misinformation. But again, that's not going to change by me wallowing in self pity.

Point is, I'm not the person who was able to find purpose or reason for this. It's just unfair. Life is inherently unfair. Sometimes it drags me down how you described. But most of the time I'm aware how pointless it is to ponder this. I just accept it and do shit with it."
"I find it so amazingly interesting the impact of such things have on an effect on you as an adult, it's almost primal/animal. For example, my father is a violent alcoholic and when I was a child I would lock myself in my bedroom, now whenever I am locked in anywhere I can get a panic/anxiety attack such as when on a plane or stuck on the london underground in the dark and can't get off at a station.

Your boyfriend should know aswell, anything that affected you as a child, no matter how traumatic is was, can be rewired and rewritten, unfortunately the bigger the trauma the harder it will be, but he will get there I have no doubt about that, I've had some fairly traumatic things happen to me as a child/young man but I managing now so I know he can too!"
"I’d see if you can’t see a therapist. Essentially, the way to deal with your concerns is to change the way you think about them. learning to accept things are the way they are, being mindfull and aware of your thought processes, and shifting your relationship with your physical proprieties so that looks become less meaningful and thus less anxiety producing are some examples. You won’t find medication for it, and these aren’t easy techniques to master - a therapist who can teach you these things properly and track your progress is your best bet. 

And these techniques are universal to many other issues - so you’ll be helping your feelings about your facial features, your social anxiety and it may potentially help you figure out who you are. "
"first foremost you need to own what you love within yourself - so if there are artistic endeavors you admire, public figures you look up to, or wavelengths of thought that you find reflect your core truth, then accept them as natural and an emotional stabilizer in your path in life, and never be afraid to communicate them, and in time you will become good at articulating that. accept some people will not share or even have opposing viewpoints, but don't emotionally react to it in realtime - i.e, internally you can be like ""fuck these people, fuck their mentality"", but you'd just be wasting energy to verbalize that type of thing (unless challenged, in which case don't be afraid to express your outlook).

another thing i'd throw in is to try your best whatever way you can to free yourself from the time constraint anxiety. it will stunt your ability for an abundance mentality, and by abundance mentality i mean recognition for positive life experiences in all the things you find interesting and worthwhile."

There's also [https://www.befrienders.org/](https://www.befrienders.org/) and [https://www.samaritans.org/](https://www.samaritans.org/) that might be worth looking in to. 

I know this is an info dump, but I hope something here helps. Keep fighting."
"I don't have much to add that others haven't already said other than I can tell you from my own personal experience that you don't need to be born into success to become a successful person.

I have many, many problems but, from an outside perspective, I am probably considered successful. I came from a financially poor background and I had an unhappy childhood due to constant bullying and not having any friends.

I worked hard to change things and now I earn good money, have an amazing group of friends who love me, and I am in pretty good physical shape due to staying active with sports etc. I'm still very unhappy most of the time and am currently going through a very difficult time in my life for various ""real-world"" reasons that would mess anyone up.

So I'm trying to make two points here:

1) you can turn your life around. If you think you can't, it's because you're not looking at the right options. There are always things you can do to improve your own life. There's no overnight fix but commitment, patience, and determination will give you measurable success.

2) no matter how ""successful"" you are, it doesn't guarantee happiness. It just helps to remove some sources of sadness and perhaps makes you more attractive to others (for the right definition of success - there's no point in being attractive to the wrong people). Being happy has less to do with success in the way you describe it and a lot more to do with learning to be content with who you are and stop comparing yourself to others. You are you, and there isn't much you can do to change that, so you simply have to get used to that and make the most of it.

I know it's hard and it will likely always be a struggle to some extent but focusing more on yourself and less on others would be a good start to improving things for yourself.

So to answer your question: never. If you give up then you are a failure. If you don't give up then you are not a failure. So keep working to make your life better. You owe it to yourself and it will eventually pay off."
"1. See a doctor, HI doc; rule out physical illness such as H Pylori. 
2. Sounds like anxiety and the a continuous manifestation and focus on the issue, an endless cycle. Takes some breaths. See a therapist if inclined. 
3. Are you by chance, hungry? "
"All that and more for me. When I'm talking my memory might lapse and A) I forget what the hell I was just talking about or B) I forget simple words and end up stumbling and stuttering while I'm desperately trying to remember a simple word like ""the"" "
Get to a therapist and stop posting on this website for answers to your various crazy-made mental states. Nobody is going to help you with this but yourself. You can't expect other people to know the true mental answers to your sufferings. Good luck.
I think it’s also worth noting that I am currently on 4-6 weeks medical leave. My doctor knew that we would be transitioning and thought it was a good idea. I plan on submitting my letter of resignation during this time period for medical reasons.
"In addition to that. It may be a good idea to check on your blood sugar, vitamin d and other things. Just to make sure that there's nothing else going on. My vitamin d was off after years of not eating right and it caused feelings of sadness as well."
"It has been a game changer for me.  Obviously, medication is not the answer for everyone. But, it has made it sooo much easier for me to live a ""normal"" and productive life.  I would at recommend at least opening up the discussion with your doctor.  "
"Just remember you’re much more than any specific diagnosis. We’re far too complex and even though this can help you understand yourself better, never forget you’re your own person and no diagnosis will ever define your possibilities. Cheer on! "
My hallucinations aren't bad enough for me to take medication. They're starting to be now but only because of my brain getting uses to being off meds I think. I'm hoping I just go back to either bearable or no hallucinations like it was for 12 years.
"My mom has depression, anxiety, self esteem issues and she’s attempted suicide before. My dad might just have depression. 

No I’ve never been to therapy. 

And I guess school just made it worse because homework, tests and other stressful stuff. "
Thank you! I woke up and I am all shaky. Had a bad time sleeping so I had to take a Xanax. Should be ok if I take those today not sure if I had anxiety from switching and was being weak or if the meds made me breathe fast or Prozac discontinuation...
"Well... he's a manager, not someone from human resources or a psychologist. He should have said nothing for sure, but it probably took him by surprise and didn't react well.

What would have been the right reaction ? What were you expecting from him?"
"When I feel a panic attack coming on, it helps me a ton to simply name what's going on. Just repeating to myself that, hey, this is anxiety, not something external that's actually wrong, helps settle me down enough to find something else to focus on."
"When you mean open, can you just go approach people in the company and say hey I am dealing with an issue and it is bothering me? Do you think they would give you good advice on how to get help within the company?

What uni if you dont mind sharing? "
"Yeah, and a lot of those skewed ideas about it mean that people are like ""oh all schizophrenics are violent"" or ""never date someone with a personality disorder, they're all abusers.""

Part of why I see people try to avoid diagnosis for those things. "
honestly i haven't even remembered dreaming or any dreams for years. But they were always about death in some way when i did. I dont think i would have nightmares about it tho its 1 of the only ways i can get off other than watching autopsy vids etc.
"Ah yes then I know exactly what it is. Though I've never used it myself, I go directly to flight and get outside, preferably somewhere where I can be alone when I have a panic attack. 
Sometimes I've been stuck from getting out and I get very angry very quickly and tell everyone to get away from me. 
I've tried a lot of calming techniques but it's easier just to get to somewhere I can be alone asap! 

I thought mindfulness was being aware (mindful) of different people and their feelings, beliefs etc. "

"I can't say what it's like in there, but I was given the option to go voluntarily a few years ago. 

I'd had a breakdown and was agoraphobic. 

I was referred to the consultant at the mental health hospital.

They were supposed to be visiting me at home but phoned just before the appointment and talked with my dad who was home. 

We loaded me up on diazepam and bundled me screaming into the car.

I sat through that meeting not knowing if I was going home again. Home was the only place I felt half safe. At the end of the meeting I asked if I was going home. They said I could choose.

It took me 2 years to recover from the agoraphobia and I still have panic and rapid cycling bipolar, I often wonder if I would have recovered better if I'd gone in-patient."
"I will never forget chasing a girl for years, finally getting her, then having her tossing me in the trash. She haunted my mind for months. I ended up losing friends because of the depression. It literally took like 8 months for me to stop thinking about her, and it was a miserable 8 months. I remember the worst part was my friends not giving a shit, so I literally had no one to talk to. Trust me, IT WILL PASS. The only advice I can give is to dont try and fill that void with something else. Instead, accept these emotions and deal with them accordingly. It's good to cry, crying is essential for healing. Love yourself, let yourself heal. If you need to vent, I'm always willing. I know exactly how you feel right now and I wouldn't wish it on my enemies. "
"My heart breaks for you. Our eldest daughter started college last year, four hours from home. She was terribly homesick for a long time (almost until Winter Break) and she used to text me every night and several times during the day. Well, this year, she went back as a Sophomore, she has her own apartment with 3 other girls, and she is doing very well in her classes. She rarely calls (maybe a couple times a week) and we still text a lot, but not as much. She adjusted and said that she is excited to be learning and doing what she loves to do.  


I can also relate to you myself because I remember being locked in the Psych Hospital away from my kids and hubby, and for the first couple nights, I was horribly homesick. They had to give me extra meds for my Anxiety in fact...I kept freaking out and crying non-stop. I was only there a week, but it seemed like a lifetime. I don't know what to tell you except see the campus health department for sure. They can steer you in the right direction. Good luck to you!"
"That sounds tough. I'm a fellow introvert who was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I didn't succeed with a therapist until I had an inkling about what was actually wrong. But then she did end up helping me a lot. It's definitely a relationship that both parties have to participate in though.

If you want to research anxiety on your own, you should look into cognitive schema. Our brains are all wired for certain learned reactions (anxiety) which might have been helpful at some point but if they are no longer needed, you need to practice changing that neural pathway. To practice, you notice that your brain is going down that pathway, identify the thing that has triggered your anxiety, and then you literally think of something positive related to that thing. The more you do it, the easier it'll get (as is the case when practicing anything).

Two more things that really helped my anxiety besides seeing a therapist are meditation (I used the free trial on Headspace to learn) and a book called Lost Connections by Johann Hari.

I hope you feel better!

Btw I'm really proud of an instragram I just started to talk about anxiety and depression. It's called @ouranimalbrains and I don't make money off of it or anything, check it out if you're interested."
"I think a good approach would be to map out more about your life currently and where you would like to be. I absolutely agree that your happiness should be a priority, but perhaps jumping straight into full-time pottery isn't the only way to get there. 

Absolutely continue to do pottery, and if that's what you want to do with your life, let's make a plan to do that - without it just becoming a ""pottery or unhappiness/death"" situation. 

You should at the very least to continue pottery as a hobby and keep doing it, and if we're going to do it as your job let's do it in a way that progress to it becoming a viable and supportive option. Keep it up, keep studying it, work on your craft and build your skills. Teach classes. Think about a strategic approach to build slowly - can you sell pieces at markets, or on etsy that could get you started? Could you set up a small website and social media accounts to show your work and maybe result in you doing some commissioned pieces? Are there any local galleries that you could approach to show or display any pieces? What about local cafes? Or are there any local business that would want some of your pieces to actually use or show?

You can work towards doing pottery full time as a very viable career choice - my point is make a plan towards doing it that makes sense, with a structured, phased approach, with milestones, with consideration towards making a name, building a small but growing business base with a mechanism for you to get sales. 

There are lots of people who don't love their job (which isn't ideal) but remember there is so much more to your life. Don't forget to supplement your work with things that you do like (like pottery but also other things). Make sure you are getting enough sleep, exercise and nourishing food - these are the things that will make the rest of it achievable. Go for walks and hikes to find inspiration. Maybe get a pet if it will work with your life. Learn to cook. Be active in communities you like. Hang out with friends. Study (although you've mentioned you're already studying) something you're interested in, or small business management to help your pottery business. Find other things that bring you joy and bring them into your life more. My point here is just that if work sucks, try as much as possible to have a balanced and satisfying life outside of it. 

Are there any other jobs or industries in your area you could work? If you don't like your job, can we work on changing this part of your life? When your business (if you work towards that), picks up, can you switch to a part time job? 

I don't know if any of this will be helpful. I just want to say that there is more in your control and your situation is absolutely not hopeless. If nothing else, a stranger on the other side of the world thinks you have more up your sleeve and took the time out of their day to throw some ideas at you to let you know all is not lost. I really think you can make this into a great situation. Let me know if you want to talk or if I can help with anything. "
"All of your points make complete sense. He can't help it.  It's his depression in almost every point you mention, while sometimes it's also your depression/behaviour.

It doesn't sound ""mild"" it's  pretty heavily impacting everything you say and do 

"
"Alongside the duration and rapidity in cycling of mood and energy swings, BPD is more to do with interpersonal relationships whereas bipolar doesn't necessarily need a trigger in the same way, although stressors like relationships can have an effect. "
"Are you on meds? If not, consider them. Sounds like it could be an emotional dysregulation issue rather than simply depression. Maybe just see a new psychiatrist, and walk in without any preconceived notion of what it might be, and see what they say. "
"Insomnia, hyperactivity, extreme mental clarity, easily emotionally overwhelmed, I’ve had horrible diarrhea and been so busy trying to do every good idea that comes to mind, I e skipped meals and almost passed out from low blood sugar a couple times"
Mood tracking apps are great. I started using eMoods. It’s not perfect for me because I rapidly cycle throughout the day and it doesn’t allow for that type of data entry. But if you just need to record overall mood for that day it’s super easy.
"So in the span of fifteen minutes I'll go from hating my best friend, to loving him, to wanting to kill myself, to wanting to do so much good in the world, to hating myself, to hating everyone, to being anxious. And then back to my default numb state "
"Stress is the biggest issue then its tension due to heavy work load

Always take bathroom brakes every hours atleast 10 min or go eat some hard candy ( not to many) 1 or 3 will do the trick

Just dont over due work if you know your body cant handle it"
"That is a good way to put it...and so true. I have been there. I have almost died twice by my own hand. I empathize with you. I am so sorry you're hurting. I hope you can get some help from someone who cares. If you need to talk, I am here for you. :)"
"The real you is the one you see when you feel the most vulnerable. Because then you'll see the real emotions and feelings that you've been holding in the entire time. But at the end of the day, this is something you'll have to figure out on your own. "
This. Sounds like OP might be right that there is more than depression going on. A psychiatrist might help by evaluating for borderline personality disorder traits (emotional dysregulation) and giving suggestions as to what the best treatment plan is.
"Why do you think you have a mental illness? What is going on? If you feel like something is ""off"" or ""not right"" then you really should see a doctor. You can work through any issues with a Therapist and things might turn out better for you. Good luck."
"Yeah it's hard waiting for it to get into your system, and if it doesn't work then you have to try another one and wait for that to get into your system. I hope that this medication works for you once it starts to take affect and gets into your system"
"she's insecure. well more than insecure. she hates herself. she thinks she's weird, ugly,fat etc.
she isn't ugly at all, she's gorgeous and not fat in the slightest , a little underweight if anything.

she's definitely different. but not in a bad way."
this post hit me hard. it covers xanax in an extreme way but its accurate. the withdrawals are HORRIBLE. best taper down if you want off this ride. the forgetful element of xanax is annoying too. you literally forget what you were doing 5 minutes ago.
"I suffered from it for a few months. First thing's first- quitting ALL substances helped me. Weed, liquor- nothing except food and water. You need to connect your mind back to your body. Lots of laughs, staring out into the distance, learning new things. You just need to rebuild your connection.   
 Sorry if none of this applies to you. I know how tough it is to go through, so I help whenever I can. I urge you to stay off any substances if you're taking any unless it's something like anti-depressants. "
"Openly talking to people i know, is out of the question.  
They never understand and i do not trust them with my stuff.  

Openly talking to strangers is the easiest, since i do not really care about what they think and trust is not an issue since it is anonymous.  

But i prefer to talk to professionals, they have better knowledge, can reflect and observe and offer decent advice.  
But i can not talk to them completely openly since i do not trust them with a few things, lets say i only trust them 95%."
"So would you say you have poor self-image( because of the judging of other people)? Mood swings (random shifts in emotions and perspectives for no reason)? Social anxiety? Anger outbursts? Impulsive behaviours (example: taking drugs, speeding, drunk driving, lying for not important reasons)? Also, would you consider yourself to be an angry soul with a feeling of emptiness and confusion? If you respond to this with more detail, i might be able to help and guide you towards finding a solution. :) peace. "
"Thank you so much (it is a cake walk most days now) and Same back atchya. :) I've been around the block a few times, and it is so hard to give up someone you love, even when they may be toxic. I can't get out of my own situation (we have 4 kids still at home) but thankfully, my hubby has been a bit more receptive to my ongoing situation (he doesn't know about the pyromania though, just that I am ""going through some stuff"") and is all for me going to see a Therapist. 

I am here anytime you need me, OK?"
"While I think life isn't as shitty as you're making it out to be, I will take your advise and use this alone time to better myself. Moving on doesn't look anywhere close in the future, but I will do everything in my power to get myself more in shape and focus on my work and my music. I've already told her that I can't have contact with her otherwise it'll make the whole process harder. So far I've resisted the whole litany of overwhelming urges to message her and I'm gonna remain strong on that front. "
"YES! I am the same way. I don't know if you've read my own post but I suffer from a ""rare"" disorder (rare because it is grossly understudied, especially in adults) and sometimes, I don't think about it at all. Then there are times like now when I am overwhelmed and can't control myself. I have a compulsion that I need to give in to or I get irritable, angry, restless, etc. Then when I DO give in, I feel loads better and very calm, satisfied, happy. You can talk to me anytime love. I am here for you. :)"
"Having a pet has been incredible for my mental health. I have 3 ferrets that were the greatest decisions I’ve made, they make me feel so happy. I love playing with them and watching them play around with each other is so adorable. They genuinely make my day brighter. They’ve also helped me form (somewhat of) a routine. They need me, as their mom I have to make sure they’re taken care of. No matter how sad I am or bad I feel about myself I have to get out of bed and make sure they’re fed and healthy and happy. Can’t spend days sleeping nonstop or stuck in bed anymore. It’s a good amount of responsibility. Helps me get out of bed everyday and on days where I only spend time with my pets it makes me feel as if I didn’t waste a day being sad. "
"To be honest, I didn’t get much out of therapy. We did exposure therapy to process the childhood trauma, we did grief work, we worked on self-compassion, core beliefs, and acknowledging my strengths. 

The very last session I had which made me quit, I came into the appointment telling my therapist that I still felt really depressed and it was hard to function. He said, “I encourage you to just stop thinking.” Excuse me? His advice before that was, “so what? Just say ‘so what’ when you’re worried and it’ll be less of an issue.” He was also anti-medication and said it would prevent me from getting the most out of therapy so I went to the doctor and got on medication. Game changer. I feel like I have my life back and feel so much better. "
"Took me a long time to get diagnosed with bipolar because I had learned through years of suffering how to remain afloat through a bad depressive or mixed episode. It was easier in college when I could plan around deadlines and my moods a bit; I didn’t have to constantly be “on” and productive. There was also a lot of coping with weed, xanax, alcohol, and adderall during that time and I never disclosed those issues with doctors...

It wasn’t until I was out of school and had constant responsibilities that my instability led to weeks and weeks of visible and tangible and relentless pain and very obvious BP symptoms. Up until then I was always one degree away from being appropriately treated.

There are too many ways people slip through the cracks."
"Self-Esteem, Self-confidence, Self-Love....the three things we could all use a little more of. What about you are in insecure about? That needs to be addressed or you'll always feel like the ""disposable friend"". News flash. Your friends wouldn't be your friends if they didn't like you for who you already are! Let go of the self-doubt, and possible self hate...You are important to them and i'm sure they are important to you. Don't push them away because of your insecurities, because the older you get, the harder it it to stop this trend. You'll do this forever with your friends, family, and relationships. The only thing ""Wrong with you"", is.....YOU...Enjoy yourself, you're probably really cool and just get a little overwhelmed at what it takes to be social....and let me tell you...it's not much....It only takes...being yourself and not caring how others see you...

"I am a social worker with post grad in counselling and a number of years in direct therapy profession, and also a consumer. 

Therapy is probably well described as a relationship that is bumpy and organic, like any relationship, and particularly intitially, while both people feel one another out. 

Different people match up differently, and sometimes there's a 'click'... sometimes there's not. It can take a bit of time to suss out whether your therapist is clicking. Sometimes this can take a few sessions and a few trips and detours. Dont put too much pressure on yourself, or on then, if you can avoid it. Try to let things unfold and see where they head. 

What I look for are insights. These days, Im pretty well tuned to when I have been invited into some new thinking about an old issue (or a new one). Insights are basically the currency of therapy. They are the flashes of inspiration that help people move forward, by getting outside of a problem and viewing it in a new light. 

I guess, on balance, if you are getting insights regularly, and they are significant, then you are doing the work of therapy and the therapy you are doing is working for you. If you consistently leave, and think 'meh', then its probably time to try someone new. 

Hope this helps.

"Hello, the Bipolars I'm experienced with take a few months to go between manic and depressive, and the manic (""happy as ever"") phase always ends with a psychotic break. However, there are more than one type of bipolar, so I cannot answer you for sure.

However, I'm someone who experiences massive mood swings as well, always seemingly without a cause, and have been like this all my life. I would go from being the most optimistic and energetic person one week to crying for days and yes, pressing ice cubes against my skin too. It turns out I've got hyperthyroidism and my body is extremely susceptible to stress, thus leading to extreme anxiety and depressive episodes. 

Now that I'm getting treatment, I see a massive difference, but I still suffer through mood swings at least once a month. So now I'm not so sure it's all about my condition and am considering going to a psychologist and trying to find some underlying reason about the sadness that has followed me all my life. 

So, my advice is - test your hormonal lessons first. Then, start writing down events that might have triggered you and lead you to depressive episodes. If you find a pattern, it may very well be that there is nothing wrong with your brain chemistry, rather with your thought patterns and subconscious, childhood traumas, etc. Bottom line, don't be in a rush to diagnose yourself with a mental illness, give yourself the benefit of the doubt and the room to explore yoir mental health without putting labels on what might be wrong.

Good luck :/"
"All of this sounds like my brother! After his job forced him to get help, he was diagnosed as bipolar at age 35. Now many of his past choices seem to make a lot more sense for all of us. He’s able to cope better now with his feelings or lack thereof."
"Hey, thanks a lot for the response.

 I, too, am no expert but when I think of the word ""depressed"", the first and only thing that comes to me is ""sadness"". Is it possible to have depression without feeling sadness? If so, what would depression entail?"
"I have looked up symptoms and I think it is very possible, especially as I have not being sleeping, I just do not get tired although I feel mentally exhausted. I will take your advice of keeping a record of patterns. Thanks for taking the time to reply"
"I recently got diagnosed and was looking through bpd subs so I could get a better understanding of it, and I found bpdlovedones. Honestly going through that sub felt so dehumanizing, I had no idea that there was so much hatred towards people with BPD. "
"If her parents are unwilling to get her help, you need to confide in another trusted adult at school or somewhere who can help.  If she is in immediate danger and cannot keep herself safe then tou should just call 911.  You are an awesome friend ��"
"If it’s that severe a neurologist would best be suited for advanced testing and interpretation of psychometric measures. I wouldn’t worry, I would feel relieve he has been referred to a higher standard of care given psychiatrists reflexive wrists. "
"Thank you, TBH I really needed to hear that. Sometimes I feel so unappreciated. I have a hard time leaving the house due to my own issues, but he works tonight, as long as he's not feelong too rough of shape today, and I'll have a few hours to myself. "
"That is a truly horrible thing to say to you. I’m sorry and she is dead wrong. Being mentally ill is absolutely not your fault. 

I’ve recently accepted that a lot of people write or rewrite their lives to suit them. They’re deluding themselves. "
"We have done everything we can for her. But I need to think about the health of myself and the rest of my family as well. God's will will be done, and if it's His will for her to be this way, then so be it. I just no longer want anything to do with it."
"Yep, some people have Intellectual disabilities. 



What you're asking is ""Why don't we use outdated terms anymore????????"" 


You must be dense af to make such question, it's common sense. 


Why don't we use ""Negro"" to refer to black people anymore?"
"Yes they do take time to start being noticed. 2 months isnt much time, especially if you were working up to higher doses.  If medication is the route you want to take, take it and stick with it. It may take some time but hopefully its worth it for you."
"Yes, I tried and tried and tried over 6 months but my mental health only got worse so I ditched the whole cbt thing and went for psychoanalyses instead with amazing results.
but that's of course not the solution for everybody!!

i wish you the best! :)"
"&gt; I feel so terrible about having passed our bad genes on, and sentenced our kids to suffer their entire lives. I sometimes wish that I hadn’t remarried and had kids. :(

Maybe you can do your part and warn them at some point.  I am fortunate in that someone did the same for me.  I am childless by choice.  

My half sister (we share a father) has been a problem all her life.  Her mother died in a mental institution.  Unfortunately, we inherit more than your Mama's good looks and Grandpa's big ears."
"Alcohol literally messes with your brain. It's a sedative and a depressant. There's is a term called 'hangixety' and those who have anxiety or depression, or other mental health issues can feel way worse the day after drinking as you tend to be dehydrated and your seratonin levels are super low, which makes it like 10x worse than it actually is. I looked into it as I started to experience really bad episodes the day after drinking. ... P.S so awesome that you stopped drinking! Such a good feeling hey!! "
"I can't get over what a similar experience I had earlier this year, again the subject was finding the ""distraction"" but at the same time working on the issue that deteriorated my mental health in the first place. I was on my own, no gf, no children, no wife, in some ways I think it was easier that way. 

Props to you for doing this and raising children at the same time, they might not ever understand fully what you went through but you went there and came through and that is how you grow your influence."
"If you go to a doctor for a proper diagnosis and then tell said doctor that these symptoms arent effecting your life that much (as you've just said here) then they will most likely dismiss you. You're aware these mood swings are happening but they don't seem to be upsetting you that bad.

Here's some quick advice. Exercise is the closest thing you can get to a cure-all. Even speaking as somebody who was diagnosed with BPD, exercise helped me regulate my moods by a LOT. But as goes with everything, ymmv."
"My mum has had mental health issues most of her life, the first 6 years of my life she was dosed up on anti-depressants until she met my dad (he’s my stepdad but he’s been more of a father to me than anyone else) so she should understand a little bit at least. I do my best to explain my situation to my family they just don’t seem like they want to hear about it. 
I’ve just been on the phone to a colleague who seemed to really understand so I think I’m going to turn to her more often
Thank you "
"Same! So glad to know I’m not alone in this. It got better as I got older but not in a healthy way. Basically I’ve been treated so awfully that I became numb to the point of not wanting to make sense of other’s actions. Making sense of other’s behavior is not even worth your energy.
Some people pick up on your empathy and manipulate you to make themselves feel better (knowingly or unknowingly). It’s like enabling others to use you. Hard to explain, sorry. 
Just know you are not alone in this. "
"Thank you for your reply, and I am glad that it could help you.

It is really hard for me to tell if she would really need it. Things have quieted down now thankfully, and we could talk a bit about it, but a few hours ago I had to physically keep her away from stuff she could harm herself with. Maybe she will get therapy now additionally to her meds. Previously, she didn't want to bring everything up again through therapy because it went fine at the moment, but that does not seem to be the case anymore."
"Thanks. :) I do try to stay away from junkie kinds of food and also things like breads, rice, and processed foods. I also am pre-diabetic, so that is my excuse that I use. :D I appreciate the advice. Now if I could only get rid of these compulsions. They literally take me over...I can't control them all the time. I can be safe when I do burn things though. :) I am always careful and if it isn't safe to burn, I don't do it. I suffer for it, but it is better to not do it than be reckless. &lt;3 Take care!"
"You shouldn't have told your wife. 

Seek help on your own and work through the issue.  In a few weeks, down play the issue with your wife and be like i just felt I was not being paid enough money and get really pissed but now i have a plan to demand a raise or look else where...""  little secret, your wife wants a piece of steel, a leader. Dont confide any of your shit in her beyond death and loss and even then, not more than a brief episode.  

Going to therapy, just tell your wife, going to the gym..."
"his reply is usually “you can’t control me”  

“wow that newscaster looks a lot like Mandy Moore, doesn’t she?” To which my husband will reply “I’d fuck her”

At that point, you just break up with him..

I know you love him and all but, come on, if he is going to be saying that, then you know he will cheat on you, he doesn't really love you, and that hurts, my advice, divorce him while you have the chance. If he doesn't treat you like you should be treated then he doesn't deserve you. "
"https://pca.st/ld2L

Relavent podcast about it I think. Community, etc. But I wonder how close this is to what you experience, and the reason I'm sharing is because I don't remember if the people from that podcast episode had a certain sort of traumatic event or any traumatic event that caused another personality.

And sorry if it's not exactly what you have, just a guess so I thought I'd share in case it's beneficial for you to listen to. It's from Reply All, episode 74 in case that link doesn't work. "
"Yo bruv. Just wanna say that it’s ok to feel jealous. While you need him to assure you, I think you need to assure yourself about the things that are causing you to feel upset.

You’re not alone - I have these bouts of jealousy too with people, my partner, everybody else. I’m not urging you to have a positive mindset. I’m asking you to look at it from another perspective: your emotions are making you feel this way. So change you I judgement.

I’ve been delving into stoic philosophy now and I think this quote my Marcus Aurelius will help you:

“If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now.”

Stay chill, bruv. Peace out.

"I'm 22. My Depression was caused/triggered by my fathers god-awful affair and then in turn my parents separation when I was just 13, but I think my mental health issues were inevitable considering the terrible mental health issues on both sides of my family. However, My sister was 15 at the time and she's perfectly fine - She's currently one of the two people in my family without mental health issues. Over time I've come to terms with the fact I probably have extreme fears of being put through the same thing my mother was put through (trust issues) and just being left in general (abandonment issues) due to my family unit just falling apart and separating.

A lot of stuff has exasperated my mental health issues since then, An all but physical abusive ex a few years ago and just last year a bullying housemate at university. But I managed to push past it. I should be at my happiest now and I'm just getting worse.

As rude as this sounds its kinda comforting knowing you feel the same and I'm not too abnormal."
"best way to fight stigma is for more of us to be out about being ill. Its all about visibility. Stigma is based on preconceptions which work from stereotypes that are pervasive, powerful, and deeply embedded in culture. The antidote to that are visible contradictions. These are most powerful in personal interactions where people who labour under preapprehensions about mental illness can question their own assumptions by seeing evidence that the assumptions they are operating from are untrue. The catch 22 of all this is, of course, that the exact thing that keeps people from being 'out' about their illness is exactly the stigma that needs to be overcome. What we, people with lived experience need to be able to do, if we can, is take opportunities to disclose. At the same time we have to balance the practical reality of these disclosures against any harm they may cause us. Its not a simple equation, and sometimes its a tough call - to make the gesture for the benefit of all, or to protect our own interests."
"Doesn't sound like a great professor.  Sounds like they can be pretty offensive too.  Sorry you have to deal with that.  On the other hand, learn what you can and leave the rest to the side.  Honestly, while I think that joke or explanation of BPD isn't funny and in poor taste, I've heard a lot worse.


Life is going to be full of great people along with plenty of rude, inconsiderate, and offensive people.  There are going to be plenty of times you and your classmates are pushed outside of your comfort zones emotionally in the real world and the folks doing it won't care whether you're visibly uncomfortable with it or not.  


The thing is with college, whether it feels like it all the time or not, it is safe.  You can always drop a class, you can talk to the department heads, you can talk to the dean if you absolutely have to.  I encourage only doing any of those things as an absolute last resort. 


Sounds like the professor sucks.  You may be learning a great deal more that will help you in life by figuring out how you can cope with this type of person and still get what you need than what you're learning from the subject material.  That's my attempt to try to put a positive spin on a bad situation.  


Hope things get better for you.  Best of luck!    "
"I’ve been through at least a dozen crappy therapists before I found one that I really love. I think the difference for me is that my current therapist focused heavily on trauma when she was in school and has continued to study trauma literature and research since then. When I first started going to therapists, I assumed all of them would be trained to help their patients work through trauma. I was very wrong. Most therapists with a masters in social work (MSW) are trained more on how to help people work through common stressors (divorce, losing your job, death in the family, etc) and deal with day to day issues. I couldn’t understand why every therapist I saw kept trying to work on my very minimal current life problems while ignoring my trauma history until I got my bachelors in Psych and learned more about the different kinds of degrees I could get if I chose to go on to grad school.

My life is good now. Almost every problem I have stems from previous trauma that I wasn’t able to talk about or process for a long time. Therefore, therapy wasn’t very effective if we couldn’t talk about the root of the problem.

My current therapist is extremely knowledgeable about trauma and understands my need to talk about it. She’s given me several readings for homework about PTSD that have helped enormously and constantly reminds me that the “crazy” ways I react to some things now is not because I’m crazy but is instead a normal reaction to having been through some really abnormal stuff. She’s great."
"I'm sorry I'm replying here, you commented on one of my week old posts somewhere else and I had a gander at your history. I feel like I need to address something here.

I'm sorry you were abused. And it looks like you're having paradox thoughts about it. You can't say that consent is BS and say that you were abused. It's either one or the other. Either you need consent, or there was abuse. Can't have night and day at the same time.

You're refusing the opinion of experts solely because they are liberals. And yet you'll notice that even conservative psychotherapists agree that consent is very real. It's just people with a wicked agenda who deny core concepts like consent. 

So either you're having a huge mental health issue which you should discuss with someone who spent years educating themselves about it(and accept that they actually know better than you, which is hard for conservatives, I know) or you're a big fake phony. 

Maybe you're not a sad little man who gets pleasure from pretending he's something he's not on the internet to be divisive(which I won't rule out because you're being pretty much textbook for trolling) but you're the genuine article, which means you're trolling yourself. Never underestimate the human capacity for bullshitting themselves.

If you have the opinions you're *very* aggressively peddling, you need therapy more than you need a therapist who agrees with your political bias. If you're just pretending, congratulations, you made a stranger care about you for your own personal thrill, which is another kind of mental health issue you should have checked out.

Best of luck to you, I hope you get the help you need. Either way, I'm going to block you, because I don't feel like hearing your answer. That should be the job of a therapist."
"One of my first memories might be psychosis, I was maybe 3 and I was left alone at home, I heard a man and woman calling my name outside of the house, but when I looked outside the windows no one was there. We lived in the country and its really not likely anyone was around, let alone anyone who knew I was alone and knew my name.

 It went full swing as a freshman in highschool, after a major traumatic event, and just got worse until I was about 19. I would have auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, lots of sleep issues and general disturbances. I was diagnosed with depression, GAD, and PTSD, which my psychosis was attributed to. 

Most the time I hear people calling me, or saying ""hey!"", door knocking, general stuff. I see shadow figures when I try to sleep, sometimes creepy faces. I've always been sensitive to horror and sometimes commercials for scary movies can trigger one of these later in the day when I forgot about it. I also hallucinate about things biting and crawling on me when I have dry skin, a connection I made recently. Sometimes I see distortions to myself, like once when I was upset and tired I saw myself with no face in the mirror, just flat. I notice that worrying about seeing things doesn't make me more likely to see them or not, in my case. 

I'm 23 now and I just got on healthcare, hopefully I can get some therapy and meds to help out with my symptoms. I've been surviving with a dog and medical marijuana, but its not going so well. Clinically I'm pretty severe, not going to college this semester, no job, no support, high risk of suicide (suicide in family, past attempts, easy access to fatal method etc) but tbh I'm pretty optimistic. I've felt worse and I've got stuff to look forward to, my psychosis doesn't bother me much now."
"I recommend seeing a psychologist (therapist) and a psychiatrist (physician) for assessments. 

If you have a good general practitioner (GP) you could start by making an appointment with him/her to discuss your issues. If you have insurance, seeing your GP might be required to get a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist. Or you may not need a referral. Before I switched insurance plans I needed referrals for everything but mental health issues were handled totally differently. I just found an in-network provider and made an appointment.

If you go to your GP, either because he/she is someone you are comfortable talking with or because you have to for insurance purposes, don’t expect too much from the appointment. They aren’t mental health specialists. You’re just getting started. Your GP might prescribe you something basic like an anti-anxiety drug. If they do, try it for awhile but if it does not solve your problems don’t be discouraged. 

Whether you choose to initially see a psychiatrist, psychologist or both will depend upon your views on medication, comfort with talking, and availability of appointments.

I’ve had experience with many different medications and many dosage adjustments. I am completely comfortable with medication. Prescription drugs = yay! Thank you science! Not oooww scary and unnatural. I have a problem with people who are against taking medication (for mental or physical problems) just like I have a problem with people who think “natural” products are “free of chemicals”. Medication does not solve every problem in life. But, if you have a mental illness due to a biochemical problem in your brain you should consider using a chemical designed to address it! 

If you start with a psychiatrist your first visit will be an initial assessment and last at least 30 minutes, probably an hour. Psychiatrists are not the “talkers”, those are the psychologists. Your first visit will normally be longer than the rest which will be “med checks”. The doctor will prescribe you one or more drugs during the first appointment. 

Ask questions if you have any. 

Make sure your doctor gives you their initial diagnosis! What do they say your problem is? 

Make sure you fully understand when and how to take the medications, and any likely or serious side effects. Your doctor is not going to name every weird thing that’s ever happened to someone but will tell you what is most likely to occur and if there are serious side effects that you need to act on if they happen. Make sure you ask if you can abruptly stop the drug if you have side effects. Like many drugs, some psych meds can make you not feel so great (nauseous, tired, etc) when you start them. Try to continue through those things. If they get so bad that you need to stop taking the pills you need to know how to stop. Abruptly stopping by just not taking them any more can make you sicker, for awhile. Your doctor may tell you to reduce your dose instead. This is less likely at the beginning because they will probably start you at low doses of meds and dropping from a low dose to zero is usually less problematic than going from a high dose straight to zero. 

Your could ask your doctor if he/she can give you any free samples. Mine have been good about that. Even with low cost generic medications, good insurance, and low co-pays, medication can get expensive if you keep having to fill new prescriptions for different drugs or new doses. Don’t abuse the free sample thing though. You might need it later if the most common drugs aren’t helping (or start to lose effectiveness) and you need to switch to something expensive. Sometimes your doctor can give you enough samples to get by on. 

When you go back for “med checks” after your initial visit, your appointments may be quick and limited to changes in your symptoms, whether you have had any side effects from the medication the psychiatrist prescribed, and any other changes in your medical history. If things aren’t working you will discuss adjustments with the doctor. That might be just an increase (or decrease) in what you are currently taking, adding (or removing) a drug, or switching drugs entirely. If you need to ease into a change by slowly increasing or decreasing doses the doctor will tell you.

Depending on the doctor your psychiatrist may not seem very chatty. They are there to manage your condition with medication. Some will discuss things with you like a psychologist would. Others won’t. It depends on their personality, how you interact, how long you have been a patient and even their schedule. I’ve been seeming my current doctor for years so he talks to me about things going on in my life more than he used to. Sometimes he does it to assess how well I am doing. Other times I think he just wants to chat if he doesn’t have a line if patients waiting. I’m saying this so you don’t get upset if your psychiatrist doesn’t seem to want to hear long stories about your problems. 

Long stories are for the psychologists. As with a psychiatrist, your first visit will be long so that they can get a lot of details on your problems and your history. How often you go back will depend upon what you both agree to. It might be multiple times a week at first then weekly.  I’ve not really found therapy very helpful but I have tried it intermittently over the years. Friends that go routinely typically go every week. I would expect anything less frequent than once a month would not be helpful. 

You can talk about your psychiatrist and medications and their effects with the psychologist. Some will know something about medications but they aren’t a substitute for your psychiatrist (for one thing they can’t actually prescribe you anything). Talking about your meds and how they affect you will help the psychologist take them into account when determining if you are doing better or worse. Your therapy could be doing wonders but if you just switched drugs and feel terrible or if a drugs effectiveness is waning, things may seem worse overall. Or you might be on a new drug that makes your useless therapist seem great (they won’t tell you that!). 

As I said I’ve not been that into therapy. It makes me feel good that day but doesn’t seem to help long-term. Maybe I still haven’t found the right therapist.

I have been told by someone in the field, and whose opinion I respect, that you should really be looking for a psychologist with a PhD. That is more true for the treatment of some problems than others. If you follow through on seeing someone and share your diagnosis I might be able to remember if it was one that he felt required the extra training of a PhD. It’s his opinion that there are far too many people with masters degrees and little training working as therapists. Some people need more than they can provide. He also cautioned against part-time therapists - people who only work a few days a week either because they have other jobs or more likely, a spouse that supports them financially. They are not likely to be that committed to the field. 

As with the psychiatrist, ask your psychologist to tell you what their diagnosis is.

Always research your symptoms, diagnosis, and medications online. Ask about them if you have questions BUT realize how often healthcare providers have to deal with “well I read this on Wikipedia...”. It’s fine to say that but I prefer to present my findings/concerns in terms of questions - “I read this about drug X online. Is that actually a common side effect? Have you had patients that have experienced it?” Even if a drug sounds horrible based on people’s complaints on Internet forums that does mean that it is for most people or will be for you. Please don’t annoy your doctor who has been practicing medicine for decades by insisting that Reddit has told you that your diagnosis is X or that drug Y gives everyone seizures.

And finally, if you see someone and are diagnosed with a mental health issue it may be chronic. Just like people who have chronic physical health problems it might be something you have to manage from now on. That’s OK. Doing that successfully may take multiple psychiatrists, trying lots of different pills (at least they seem to keep coming out with new ones!), and trying different therapists. You have to find what helps you and adjust as needed so it continues to help.

I have a nephew who is a detective in an area with a very high rate of suicide and a low rate of homicide.  Nobody knows why. "
"Good, the risk of another hypomanic episode is definitely lowered considerably on a mood stabilizer, but no one can say for sure if an episode will happen again or not. Different things can trigger an episode, like medication (as you know) or stressors."
I shyed away from medication for so long. It's only been two weeks but I already can feel the difference. Just notbhaving a head cluttered with intrusive thoughts and not aching constantly from being so tense with stress and anxiety feels like a new me.
"I've booked an appointment for this, among other things on Monday. I was just hoping that there may be done tips from people, because I have 9 to 5 workshops every day this week, with a test at the end, and it's quite important for my degree apparently."

My doctor is a moron and told me to just stop...after I told them they need to do some research into sari withdraw they looked into it and said 2 weeks should be fine. I didnt think that was enough and wanted to make it so the side effects was minimal.
"Okay, so you believe nothing bad or wrong happened to you.  And by your own logic, your story doesn't matter.  By your own logic, your life doesn't matter.  By your own logic, you should shut up and go away.

So get on with it and go away, in that case."
"Talk to a parent, sibiling or friend who can let you stay at their home until you can fid your own place. Put your mental health and self love first and over a lease or a relationship. You need to make that first move to make YOURSELF be better, leave. "
"To add also, give the medication a few months to get into your system and really pay attention to what it does for you. Just trying it for a couple weeks won’t help. It was honestly the difference between life or death for me. Best of luck, OP. ��"
"You made a great choice! I don't know if this is everyone or just me, but it took me several appointments before I started actually feeling better, so I just wanted to encourage you to stick with it even if the first appointment doesn't go perfectly. :)"
"I have minutes, sometimes hours of mania but there are so many emotions I experience over the course of a day that it's nearly impossible for me to tell if I have an underlying bout of depression or mania also going on since I have moments of both usually every day. I was diagnosed with Bipolar first, then BPD was added a few years later, and I felt like BPD made more sense because of the quick changes of my mood swings, but I've read that some people with Bipolar Disorder also experience rapid-cycling. "
"I shouldn't even bother rising to your bait, since you can't figure out how to respond to threads properly, but I'm bored and waiting for feedback at work, so here goes.

I have no gods, and I do not believe in Hell.  I cannot hate something that I don't believe exists.  So you're wrong, and bearing false witness, and being arrogant and prideful.  

Great job being a shitty Christian.  If you believe you are the best representative of your religion, you've chosen a shitty religion that I want no part of."
"It’s definitely something I’m gonna look into. She’s suffered with depression and anxiety for most of her adult life, and I supported her to the point she felt she could come off her tablets. I suggested couples counselling to her a while ago and she just brushed it off saying that doctors don’t work. 

Emotions are definitely better when expressed, and the only silver lining I can find out of this is that I can use my ability to express myself hopefully to have a positive effect on someone else."
"This isn’t medical advise, as I’m not a medical doctor, but when coming off cymbalta, I took one every few days, right when those weird sounds and pain hit when you move your eyes. I also felt disassociated, but luckily, it did not cause me depression. Then, when I ran out, I found some old lexapro and took one of those upon hearing/feeling the woozy brain zaps and it worked like a charm. Lexapro was way easier to get off of. Again, not medical advice, just something that helped with the withdrawal. "
"I think this is great advice (and I respect its nihilistic basis; being how I perceive the detachment of emotion you promote) and I think it is a door to a free mind. Beyond that I think pain in life is a simple mindset. Once we let go of our emotional constructions and focus on what we want to do then life does become fun. It becomes a place from which to observe and interact in anything you can before time catches you. 

The son of this person I am sure would sooner reflect on the strength of a parent that turned troubles in to opportunity and not teach such a child there is an easy way out. But we must all make our own choices. And the pain for which we are burdened may be passed down to those we love the most; until when? Until someone deals with it. "
"If telling your parents is what you need to do to get the help you need, it's absolutely worth it. [Here's a vid](https://youtu.be/nQYdqAuoDko?t=3m14s) on how to talk to parents. It's a hard conversation but it will be okay in the end. And here's a free [ED workbook](https://katimorton.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f01aa0f56ab012b6ef8891f48&amp;id=e40e965ac7) (the page asks for a lot of info which I've found is off-putting, so if it makes you uncomfortable just make stuff up as long as your email address is correct). If you decide not to talk to your parents, there are other ways to reach out for support and help like talking to your school counselor or talking to the NEDA [hotline](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline)."
"That is a great first step, talking to this nurse. Is she going to help you make an appointment? 

I have had mostly good experiences with mental health professionals. When I say mostly, nothing too bad happened, I had a therapist for 3 months that was new and didn't have experience; and I once met a doctor that was trying to sell me TMS therapy but I didn't want it and I felt like he was not listening. Otherwise I've had great care over these past 9 years that I've needed mental health services.

I think a lot of it is 'treat them well and they'll treat you well'. And if one is being dismissive, see someone else. Sometimes you have to ""shop around"" for good care. Most people who work in mental health are good people who want to help your quality of life."
"When I left my abusive husband, I wondered how he still had friends after that. Why would someone be friends with a known abuser? But they all probably just thought I was an exaggerator. 

I don't mean to come off as harsh but you willingly decided to stay friends with someone who has no problem beating their wife. It shouldn't be a surprise that he's acting like this. 

Cut him off. Like yesterday. If he comes near you or your family, call the police. You can't help someone like that. Get away before he does hurt you or someone close to you. 

Edit: Downvoted but am I wrong? OP's friend is a piece of shit and dangerous. OP is only risking himself and his family by staying close to this guy. He deserves better friends, not ones that abuse him. Ffs Reddit "
"It's important to remember that every uncomfortable emotion you have has a corresponding uncomfortable physical sensation somewhere in the body.  So when you have high anxiety, you feel a little 'something"" all kinds of places.  When you start worrying about a sensation, it just makes the sensation worse which ticks up more worry.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of thinking about the next bodily sensation you have, try drowning it out with other sensations.  Like take a hot bath to relax all your muscles and lay down for a few minutes.  Then only after you've done something to relax do you want to check in with your body and see if the sensation is still as strong.  Then remind yourself that you've felt stronger sensations before and survived it just fine.  


Remember too that anxiety pulls blood away from you digestive track, so if you are worrier then some feelings of indigestion is to be expected.  Just repeat to yourself, ""That's just my anxiety I'm feeling in my body, and I've survived a lot worse than this."""
"I’m so glad your doctor is following up! Some doctors are completely incompetent and just prescribe meds and send you on your way and I wanted to make sure you didn’t get one of those. Yeah I’m sure if you look back in my comment history you’ll see that I never comment anywhere but for some reason I had to reply to your post and I’m glad I did. I really hope this medicine works for you, just remember if it doesn’t it isn’t the end of the road! This is unsolicited advice but I’m going to tell you anyway lol. Whenever I’m having a really hard time (aka really want to kill myself) I have a list of “all the things I haven’t tried yet” my list includes things like going inpatient, switching psychiatrists, changing meds, getting another therapist, moving, exercising everyday, getting a service dog, etc. and I tell myself that I have to try EVERYTHING to get myself better before I’m allowed to kill myself because none of it can be worse than the pain my family would feel if I were gone. "
"There's a degree to which your experience is healthy - but it's also cause for concern. It's almost like a dissociative event meets imposter syndrome. If you're not seeing a therapist then I'd recommend it. This can get worse for you.

The reason I say that it could be healthy is that it's is helpful to understand that people literally live in different realities - and your perception of reality is shaped by your brain. Someone may perceive themselves to be something totally different than what you see and vice versa. So, there's a degree to which you are reflecting yourself onto others. It begs the question - are they real? Or am I making them up? If you've ever watched True Detective season 1 - Rust Cohle has a great line.


&gt;You, yourself, this whole big drama, it was never more than a jerry-rig of presumption and dumb will, and you could just let go. To finally know that you didn't have to hold on so tight. To realize that all your life--you know, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain--it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person. And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it.

You may have simply realized that you're in that room."
"I think it’s called suicidal ideation. Like thoughts of suicide but not a plan. You sound very similar to me actually and for years I was in this same state. While it isn’t great, I wasn’t concerned for my wellbeing however, this year it increased to me actually planning it out and willing to do it. This was where I drew the line and immediately scheduled a doctors appointment that same week. If I couldn’t wait until the appointment, I was going to the ER because I knew all along I wanted to live but the chemicals in my brain were essentially lying to me and convincing me otherwise. To me it made more sense to see it as a chemical imbalance which is probably why medication has worked best for me. They are still working on the right meds and doses but I am definitely not a risk to myself anymore (I might even be able to get rid of the thoughts entirely but less not get too excited yet haha). I would say if you have the right coping skills now, and you are comfortable in this state, then you are not a risk HOWEVER if any of that changes even the slightest, I would immediately have a crisis plan ready and a decision for how you want to get help. Another thing that is “easy” (not really but doable) is to make sure your pillars that hold you up (what makes you mentally and physically strong) are strengthened every day. My pillars are my family, my purpose, my finances, my health, and my happiness. If too many of my pillars are suffering, I am at risk for a crisis. I do work on them each day by interacting with my family, having a stable job and income, taking my meds, and evaluating my reactions to things. It helps to identify what is important to you so you can lean on these pillars if you feel like you holding too much. Hope this helps and good luck!"
"Learning to talk to non-autistic people is a skill that you learn like studying a foreign language. The more you practice with native speakers the more fluent you become. On the other hand anxiety can mess up any attempt at learning a foreign language. Going to professionals that are willing to help with anxiety would be a fist step in becoming skilled at that ""foreign language"". 

Besides dealing with anxiety you need to know that until you are 25-30 years old your brain has not finished maturing. Part of that physical development of the structure of the brain helps you control the emotion-driven part of your brain. Maybe read a little about the brain so you can understand that it will get better if nothing else changes. Here is an introductory article on the *new knowledge* that scientists have on how the brain matures: 

 https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2011/10/beautiful-brains/


In the meantime learning about the brain and about that ""foreign language"" will get you ready to practice fluency . Build up your knowledge base --this does not require any human interactions. This will help you do even better when you have had someone help you with your anxiety. 


Another tip: reach out to organizations that are ran **100% by other autistics**. Learn more about surviving in the world where everyone else ""speaks another language"" by asking  for tips from people that have been where you are right now. For example I am autistic [was diagnosed with Asperger's] and we [fellow autistics] can help each other and sympathize with each other. 


Here's what happened to one person when they found out they were autistic:

&gt;In the summer of 2012, shortly after my wedding to my fabulous wife, someone involved with the Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism blog heard from a teenager who’d been newly diagnosed as Autistic. Learning that she was Autistic had devastated this young woman; because the mainstream discourse about autism is so negative and stigmatizing, she thought that it meant she was permanently “doomed” to a wretched life of being “broken.” She felt so hopeless that she was seriously considering suicide.  http://neurocosmopolitanism.com/advice-to-young-autistics-stick-around-and-be-awesome/  

Go to the link to see what happened after that.  "
" I was was abused as a kid, and whenever I have a flashback from one of those years, I get the same sensation that you describe here. It happens as I “dissociate” from my surroundings and basically recede back into that time, and the kid I used to be"
"Come for me instead you gutless prick . I'll teach you what it means to be threatening innocent children.  Come on you coward . Pick a real target.  Me . Not the kids . I'll give you all my contact details just ask and let's go . 
Gutless little prick . "
I never intended to take ownership of social media. I just wish we could redirect it to an environment of positivity and belonging not a place of hate and division. but thank you for your critique and I defiantly will make sure to apply your corrections
"I was involuntarily committed by my family as a 17 year old. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me and made things even worse. I would advise against having her committed.

Add on: It also permanently ruined my relationship with my family too. "
"It’s been a month and a half and depersonalization May be a better term, I don’t wanna say it feels like am outta body experience but it feels like I’m playing the game of like I’m third person instead first person if that makes any sense at all "
"Oh yup. Dang it...can you see through my computer or something? This is EXACTLY me lol.  


I keep refreshing the page to see if there are new posts. I gotta get a life.  


(To be fair, I just got home from taking a walk and I walk in the morning too.) "
"Thank you for responding. My diet is admittedly crap, I can go through a 2-liter for lunch. I'll Google the basics, I'd assume it's mostly fruits and veggies. If I were to keep a log, what should I even be on the lookout for as far as ""feeling better""? 
"
"Thank you. It’s a weird feeling to process to be honest. Leading up to it I was filled with a lot of excitement because I know it’s a milestone in my mental health. But to be facing this day, I’ve been reflecting a lot and it’s made me emotional."
"You aren't. Go read what I just posted...you want to hear dramatic? Yikes. I had a really weird ass experience today. Going to therapy based on your worries is perfectly OK. That's what you're supposed to do, but I get what you meant. :) Good luck again!"
"I have both of those and from my experience, I have generalized moods that last awhile. I’ll go through periods of depression, hypomania, and normal moods from the bipolar disorder. With the bpd, my mood can shift quickly because I view an interpersonal situation incorrectly but it doesn’t ever really stick like the moods from bipolar disorder. It’s not uncommon to be diagnosed with both. Bipolar disorder needs to be treated with medication and bpd can get better over time, especially with therapy. "
"I have intrusive thoughts also of fire...I can't stop myself from lighting stuff on fire once these thoughts enter my mind. It builds and builds until I just have to do it. Then I feel better, and I feel calmer. Sometimes, music works. If I can distract my mind enough, the thoughts shut up and I feel calmer again. Try listening to music and really concentrating on the words or the music itself. Try to find each instrument that is being played...that is all I have. :( Sorry if that doesn't help. Good luck."
"I joke and say my life is ""one walking talking existential crisis"" so believe me, I relate so much. I would argue that yes, your 20's are the ""Best years of your life"" but also that they are the scariest. Everyone is scared - don't let their perfect instagrams fool you. We're growing up in a time where we are constantly tending to our reputations online; we can  portray an image and a person that isn't truly us. I wish we were all more open in letting each other know we are not alone. I always try to be. "
"Sometimes a sudden change in attitude is a bad sign. But it can also be a good one too. Just pay attention to how he acts. And if you ever get concerned about him, don't be afraid to show him tough love. Again, pay attention closely. Especially if he's suddenly extremely happy. Just so that you can make sure that he doesn't do something to hurt himself.

It could just be him enjoying life. But if he's struggled with issues in the past, you don't want to take the risk. Just pay attention and be his friend."
"Think of it this way, most therapists 50% or less are below average. Out ot the other 50% maybe 25% are above average. That's 1 in 4 therapists are above average. Maybe in 1 in 10 are stellar. You have to screen them, use a free consult, and if after the first visit, you're not sold on them, move on until you are.  

You need to simplify your life as much as you can. 
Diet, exercise, sleep, and finances. Focus on making those core things manageable and then branch to other things, have a plan to do that. "
"Well, whether your favorite team wins or loses, you yourself have absolutely NOTHING to do with the outcome. Therefore, you need to remind yourself of that. I finally came to that realization after spending about 3 years arguing with people and getting angry. I always remind myself not to let what anyone else does control my emotions (assuming they aren't trying to hurt my family).  Only ME should be in control of my emotions. I like it much better that way and I'm way less angry when it comes to sports. "
"Perhaps. We do have a history of thyroid issues in our family. In that case, I know how fatigue (either chemical or neurological) can affect somebody's life and relationships first hand. The only problem is he was out late last night at a party drinking and dancing. Doesn't sound like a lack of thyroxine to me.  


We've been talking and realized that even though he is good at making friends, he only ever maintains a surface level relationship with them despite being friendly. If a friend follows up with him and asks to hang out he will usually turn them down. It could be that he was always this way, and only ever maintains a close relationship with one group of people at a time while unconsciously being apathetic towards other social groups.   


It is a sad thought, but perhaps that just is the personality of my brother. It could be a personality disorder of some type, or just a lifestyle decision. It's made us all realize that when he eventually moves out, we'll probably never see or hear from him again."
"It's very hard sometimes. I remember myself driving and having these urges to hit the pole. That was long time ago. This was a voice of the person who wanted me in the past to hurt myself. A bully. 
Every morning at that time, I stood by the mirror and repeated loudly, that I loved myself, i had so many people around me, who loved me. I would tell myself how many times I didn't act on these urges and how proud I was, because I didn't, and that I was worth to be happy, despite of what someone else wanted me to do.
I started getting out of the house an drive more with these voices and urges. I started labelling these voices when I heard them or felt these urges to harm myself, or saw the flashbacks of me actually doing it.
I started going to the gym, swimming, and doing things I deserved. I started listening meditation and learning grounding techniques from my therapist. Grounding and therapy is very important. 
I wish you all the best and finding the way out of this. It must be exhausting and frustrating, maybe even frightening for you. I'll tell you that everything in life is temporary and even these hardest times are going to pass. I'm in recovery with help of my therapist and don't have these urges, voices anymore, but I know how exhausting it was for me. "
"hey,your post was very sad to read. I'm sorry you are struggling so much with everything. I don't even need to know you tell you that are absolutely NOT a failure. Everyone has potential and capacity for greatness, but sometimes we just get a bit lost and don't know how to access that greatness within us. Everyone also has the capacity to improve their lives, no matter how difficult their external circumstances are. It's discouraging when everything seems so shitty and your life just seems to be accumulating in shittiness, but it doesnt have to be that way forever, dig deep and find your inner strength, your real worth. You seem to focus more on your weaknesses- things you suck at or don't compare to others, (living at home, no car, no gf etc) rather than what strengths or skills you do possess. Even if you suck at everything (which is unlikely)- many skills can be learnt, even if they aren't innate. So what is stopping you from learning and growing? it's not gonna help if you wake up everyday and remind yourself of all the things you suck at, they may be true, but it doesnt mean you need to focus on it regularly to further bring yourself down. Focus on things you are good at, skills that have the capacity to develop, start with small goals, baby steps, even if its something very minor like just cleaning up after yourself or taking care of yourself in some way. No one can give you all the answers, lay it out for you, or make your life better. YOU are the only person who has the power to change your life, you have the power to focus on your strengths, manage your weaknesses (but don't feed into them), you are the only one who can decide what you will pursue, only you know what goals you have. So don't talk to the person who has the power to have a better life in such a harsh manner (yourself!). Don't label yourself a failure and loathe over the things you have not attained.

Also, whats with the burning hatred for random people who are mean online? Theres some pretty horrible people out there, and no matter what you do, they'll always be horrible and nasty. Dealing with them is BAD energy, negative and hateful. Don't surround yourself in that kinda energy. There's people that have been through horrible shit, and mistreated their whole lives- yet have so much love to give others. Thats the kinda people you wanna be around or pay attention to. (even if its online.

Btw Comparison is VERY unhealthy and harmful for anyone's self esteem and well being. The world is unfair,once you accept this without any bitterness, you may feel a lot better.  Some people are born lucky, and some are born into shitty lives, but our external world does not determine our destiny. You underestimate how much power you actually have. If you are open, look into resources available for people struggling with mental health. I find TED talks or goal cast videos to be incredibly inspirational. Not in a way that compares, (my life is still better than theirs etc) but it really proves that humans are so resilient and powerful. As are you. I wish you the best of luck. I hope you start treating yourself with more compassion, because you really deserve a chance at life too.

"*huggle* thanks so much. I just don’t know what to do. I’m so suggestible. I believe anything anyone tells me ever. It also seems to feel like anything anyone says about me to me becomes true. I’m so fucking scared, I don’t know what to do at all "
"A lot of people have this, its already being considered normal due to the internet.

Massive data into the brain causes it to burn and crash. The memories are stored you just dont know how to get them.

Edit: i dont remember specifically 6 year of my life"
"As much as I appreciate you telling me that, I don't know if I am or not if that makes sense. I've been a wreck all day..... It hurts more knowing that even here where I thought I could vent before I see someone that people think this is an overreaction. "
"I am angry but I believe that anger comes from fear and sadness, not actual anger. IDK. I would never show him that I am angry from this. I know that wouldn't help him or our family. I vent in my journal and will likely vent to my therapist this weekend. "
"I can relate to most of the things you have described except for the self harm aspect. For the most part you have described symptoms of ADHD but you might have to speak with a psychiatrist for guidance. Wish you all the best, just know you are not alone. "
"I completely relate! Sometimes those negative experiences are really building blocks and doorways to the real me, and it’s so freeing to move on knowing how much I’ve overcome. I’ve even starting seeing how ctpsd is a gift to where my life is going."
"I feel ya man been doing the same also 22, I honestly just think it's part of the weird stage people are going through at this age. So I've just been working on myself as of lately, and am slowing finding I don't  really hate myself as much as i thought. "
I know how that feels. I've spent the last couple years basically just laying in bed. Sometimes it's easier to just give up and zone out rather than deal with how overwhelming life can be at times. Are you currently seeing a doctor or therapist right now?
I wish more people realized that it's okay to be quiet or introverted. Maybe then we wouldn't have so many people being afraid to be themselves. One of the worst feelings in life is to be told that something's wrong with you just because you're different.
"I'm in the same boat, and yeah I'd agree that it sounds like a symptom of depression. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and disthymia and my therapist tells me that dwelling on negative past experiences is a common feature of depression. "
"If you need someone in-person to talk to and are in the US, NAMI can provide local resources of all kinds. They also offer support groups completely free of charge... though these aren't therapy, its support but those have always helped me with my issues."
"It wouldn't hurt to talk to someone. The professionals are there to help, and they won't judge you. If anything, you would be able to get it off your chest and if it doesn't get better, then you will have someone there who is qualified to help. Good luck!"
"Oh ok

You should checkout some of these website and see if this is similar to your symptoms 

https://www.healthline.com/health/schizophrenia/paranoid-schizophrenia

You really don't go see a doctor or psychiatrist, he or she might be able to help a lot!"
"Please don't listen to this dude, one look at his post history - he's an incel/redpill MRA type, they are literally the kind of men your friend talks about that bury their emotions until they calcify and go rotten and end up shooting up a bunch of people."
"Right, and thats what i need to get through my head. I know for a fact that there are many ways to make a lot of money, and be successful and even be happy doing them. I just need to convince myself that I can do it without needing that particular title. "
Talk to your dad. And tell him exactly how you feel. You need to take care of this right now before it gets any worse. Be honest with him. And tell him the complete truth. Get help now while you're still young. You'll thank yourself later on for doing so.
Thanks. :) That actually makes me feel a bit better. I do need to be focusing on the good things instead of the bad ones. And appreciating the little things. I will also definitely try to talk to my husband tonight. Hopefully that will be productive too.
"That's good to know thank you so much I try to ask about things like where people are from, favorite movies and music. I once was able to calm a guy by talking about music and we realized we basically had the same taste. I am so glad you are doing better!"
"Try meditation. I was skeptical and still don't do it as much as I should, but a few days worth of 10 minutes/day practicing directing your thoughts (ie shutting that voice up for a bit) goes a long way towards regaining control of your thought patterns.
"
"Yeah I mean I know when to say I’m sorry and all that but it sounds really fake. 
“My grandma died.” And I’m there for a second like ok? and then go “oh. I’m sorry.” And lmao it’s obvious that I’m not sorry and I don’t know how to act."
"Yeah if I'm not self reflecting on my mood and my mental state then I feel fine, but if I think about it I realized how I feel out of it. I'm not feeling down about it or depressed with my position in life I just don't like feeling not 100% mentally there"
"Yes and no. Life does feel like a lesson at times. That's for sure. But mindset is that if I don't have any privacy, then what's the point in even doing anything? Or trying to get better?

That's why you need to get help. Don't suffer the same fate as me."
"Zoloft usually takes a month to start working and to see side effects even if you're hipersensitive to meds. 

People who have side effects need to tap down the dose if it doesn't work than you need to stop them and ask a therapist about changing the meds"
"regretting transition is actually really uncommon!
here’s a few studies. most show between 1.1-6% of trans people have regrets about medically transitioning, and most would still chose to do it. 
signed, a trans person who’s thankful for transitioning"
"Firstly buddy, I know nothing we say will actually 100% silence that fear but I can try to help comfort you. I wanna start by saying nobody is gonna want to give someone free lsd, it's expensive. Secondly, even if you do come into contact with it you will be fine afterwards, heck you might even be glad you came into contact with it if you did. How I would start to face this problem is by figuring out what caused your anxiety when you took the edible, and work on figuring out how to manage those anxieties. "
"How has BPD affected your life? And look at it this way, now you know what's going on in your brain and now you can take steps to better your life. Many successful people have BPD! It feels like a setback or maybe even a failure...but it's not your fault at all!!! It could be genetic or even something that developed because of experiences you had. I'm telling you, this doesn't mean you're crazy or that anything is ""wrong"" with you. Everyone has something! Now you know what your something is.

"I am not sure the concept exists as it is classically defined.

I've never met a single person who didn't have some issue, problem, illness, hangup or other factor that made them feel ""abnormal.""

So in that sense, being ""normal"" would make me ""abnormal""!

Semi-kidding aside, if you mean would I rather not have anxiety and depression? For years I would have said yes. But now, I am not sure. It is part of who I am. And more than that, learning how to accept my conditions has helped me grow in a lot of ways."
"I see that you take the time to comment and support others. Even within the past 24 hours, even given how you feel right now. I am sorry you feel the way you do, I am sorry for the hate you have for yourself. But that's alright; you feel the way you do and are allowed to. I will offer this, from a stranger probably across the globe, even if it just for a moment, that someone can feel how hurt you are from your single paragraph, so, from me to you, in this moment: You are okay. You are safe. You are loved. "
"Medications are often looked at as a tool, one part of a bigger equation. Therapy has such a stigma, but if you find the right therapist they can help you bring out your own qualities and problem solving skills in a way that you can carry with you through life to deal with future situations. There are many different types of therapy, some are quick (a few sessions) and some are longer. The right therapist can help your determine the right process for you in conjunction with medications you are prescribed. "
"Not sure. I have difficulties putting in words exactly why I consider myself emotionally and psychologically abused by my parents and mother in particular. Mainly because I don't remember much of my childhood. What I do remember is just my integrity constantly being disrespected. Lots of shouting, degrading, humiliation, ignored needs. I don't care if they did the best to their ability. Their best wasn't good enough and I wish my childhood was safer and that I as a result could function better as an adult."
"The most comprehensive app I've ever found is the DBSA Wellness Tracker. It does remind you daily to check in, and will give you a PDF of your habits. It's definitely not very flashy though; the most helpful thing about it is that it's pretty wild to see everything mapped out in front of you. But it doesn't push you to make any changes or give helpful advice. I might recommend using this app along with something more therapeutic and a little less clinical so that you get a little of both sides.

Good luck!"
"When you say you know you have brain damage, do you mean you have been diagnosed? Your heart stopping for a few seconds probably wouldn’t enough to cause brain damage. Ischaemia (oxygen deprivation) in the brain will cause damage if left too long, effectively this would be a stroke however I don’t think a few seconds of reduced or no blood flow would be enough to cause long term damage. Also most balance actually comes from vision, if you have impaired vision this may be a cause of your balance issue. "
Wow that's actually amazing. Thank you for sharing. It's sad people can't just express how they feel sometimes until it's to late. She must be a good friend. I do have a support system and I know I'm lucky for it.  but I was in full panic and depression mode when I wrote this and when that happens it feels like I have nothing and puts things in my head that are just really painful to think about. Thank you for reaching out �� and I hope everyone has a good long weekend. I appreciate all of your support
"Have you talked to your parents about this? 

Depression and other mental illnesses can be genetic. If one or both of your parents suffer from it, they might be able to help you find what you need in terms of doctors and medication.

The important thing to remember is that different things work for different people. There is no “one size fits all” treatment when it comes to mental health. Try a different therapist and maybe see your family doctor and see if they can prescribe a medication for you. Try different combinations of medications and therapy.

Please try to remember that you have a lot to live for. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, though it might be a struggle to get there. You’re not alone in this, either. We all know the feeling. "
"Thank you, I'm not sure I would call it that, exactly, because adapting to it would probably be less 'all-or-nothing' and less draining. It's a coping strategy, for sure, but not an entirely healthy one.

I work nearly every day in therapy to come up with healthier ones and I'm getting better at it. Thank you for your support!

It's funny because inpatient is in some ways very much like middle school with cliques. My best friend and I were both the outgoing 'cool kids' (sorry, that was cringey even to write), he played football, I was in a sorority, etc. and it was amazing to have someone there that GOT IT. He was my roommate on the outside for a while and the conversations we would have convincing each other to go out were hilarious in a pathetic sort of way, then we would go out and be social and do shots and take cute instagrams to prove we had a life, and then go watch hours of Naruto to decompress and curl up into stressed out balls and then bitch about how much being social sucks for a week afterwards."
"I feel like this would be a good thing to talk about with her. Also, we're not all given the same circumstances in life. You never know, maybe her parents put her through school, maybe she was raised in a better home that encouraged her to achieve what she has achieved.

People with mental health issues \*can\* be genetically predisposed (like people with bipolar disorders), but the main cause for mental health illness is the environment that we grow up in. It's not our fault that we have these disorders, and we can't help that we feel the way that we do. As children we are at the mercy of our parents and our environment; we can't help but to be shaped by these factors in our lives that we \*didn't\* choose. All we can do as adults is try to make something out of it.

I'm a nursing student, and in my psych clinical the art therapist said something that will always stick with me. She randomly gave each of the patients a big sheet of paper with half of an image printed onto it, and she made them draw the other half. Throughout the session she said ""In life we are all given circumstances that we didn't choose, but we have to make something out of it."" That hit me so hard, because no one knows that I am diagnosed with depression, and in that time I felt like one of the patients. 

&amp;#x200B;

You are taking the right steps (by going to therapy) to better yourself and make something out of your life. There are people in their 40's that are in the same nursing class as me, and I'm 21 so I got that going for me. Everyone has their own pace in life. It's not about what you accomplish for others, it's about what you accomplish for yourself and what that means to \*YOU\*. You are still so young, you have so much potential. I believe in you!"
