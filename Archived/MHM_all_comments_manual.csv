"[This always comes in mind when I think of strict Asian parents.](http://torontolife.com/city/crime/jennifer-pan-revenge/) That approach is way extreme though, and I'm 95% sure you're better than that.At the end of the day though, you are their kid. They're not intentionally malicious, and they probably have your best interests in mind, even if they have a... different way of executing their concern. And if not (god forbid), well, you're still your own person. Honest, effective communication and persistence and maybe you'll all either come to some level of acceptance or simply agree to disagree. Indefinite time off would be nice for some relief, but ultimately good communication leaves a better taste than holding a grudge and severing ties with the family.",Related
"From my (second-hand) experience, going to the doctor is one of the best things to do. I wouldn't know what to say or how to schedule an appointment, but I've heard from many people that going to the doctor and talking about their problems helped them a ton.",Related
"I'm stuck. When you are faced with what you know you should do for your own good vs. what you want to do, what do you do? I'm battling time and I need to make a decision fast, but I just can't seem to pick the right one. I want to take time off this summer and go back home to be with family, but I have got a part time job offer here that I could take up and make some income. I know I could do it if I just put up with it. But living alone away from family has really been bringing constant depression for the past few months, and to add to that I really don't want to go on another academic term. I'm feeling so burnt out and lost as to what to do, and this is constantly brought up in my mind that I can't even concentrate on studying without my mind wandering off..",Related

I'm still a couple years late graduating due to mental health issues and I have to keep reminding myself that I did the best I could.

"I haven't heard back from the dream job I interviewed for last Wednesday. They contacted me outside of jobmine and they were generally really fast. Guess I got rejected. I have already bombed 2 other interviews. I don't know how to do technical interviews. People say hackerrank and CTCI but I don't know how anyone can have the time to do those on top of schoolwork. 3 more interviews this week and I'm already feeling like I'm not gonna get any job. Hearing someone interviewing for the same position telling me how much coding practice they've done doesn't help either.Every night when I fall asleep I have bad dreams about being rejected from jobs, sitting in a midterm and unable to do anything, or being required to withdraw from school. When I wake up, I face the reality of being behind in all my courses, as well as my inability to do interviews. I am not good at anything. I fail at everything, whereas people around me get shiny marks and shiny jobs.Sometimes I just want to disappear. Life is such a struggle. ",Related

I always look at it like just get as many marks as you can so that it's easier next time. It's really easy to not try and give up if you know you'll do badly. So you have to tell yourself to try and get as many marks as you can and you will do better next time. ,Related
