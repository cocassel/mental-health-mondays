"Awks Canada post has been doing this for decades. Mail within Canada won’t be searched unless it’s obviously drugs, so many retailers have been sending pot online within Canada using Canada Post. Other mail systems like Fedex are subject to search tho "
"Chicken broth or vegetable juice might help with that a little bit. At least this way you'll be getting some sort of nutrients if solid food isn't digesting properly.

Coincidentally, someone in the UWaterloo discord is having the same problem with eating."
Fascism will not rise in America as long as the 2nd amendment still exists. I doubt that anything as bad as what I think you think is happening is actually happening /will happen. I'm not a fan of the polarization thats been happening. Its good for no one.
"Guys can you please not spam my email. My mom bought me this new laptop and it gets really hot when my email is being spammed. Now my leg is starting to hurt because it is getting so hot. Please, if you don't want me to get burned, then dont spam my email."
"It would’ve been really nice if there were little gazebos or covered patios that were built and had the pianos in there....there could’ve been nice seating around the piano too so people could listen too. 

Idk. The pianos were a good idea in theory..."
"Let us know how that pans out lmao :)

My impression of C E C A is that if you do anything out of the ordinary, you'll be 'antagonizing' them. In this case, they're likely to call you ungrateful and have you write an apology letter to all parties involved."
"No the last two things are things I wanted prescriptions for and really safe (like you can get OTC versions just in a lower concentration at any beauty store) but they were like nope. Told me I had to get hormonal birth control or else I was out of luck.

"No, someone like Peterson should be free to give a lecture, although I think it is silly in a ""old man yells at cloud"" manner when he talks about stuff outside his actual area of research (which is a shame since some of his earlier papers are interesting)."
"Unless you have another offer, or some reason why you need 40/hr, you don't really have a great negotiating position. I really doubt they would pay you the same as they pay full time employees, it would probably make the full time employees somewhat upset."
"VK does this in CHEM 323 too, albeit with a better question than the 220 one. He said he'd put more emphasis on assignments if he could but he never gets enough TAs to grade them so he resorts to quizzes like this. The question was pretty shit though ngl. "
"Yea. Another country that isn't being taken over by the Chinese?

In all seriousness, I live in Kitchener, and just study at coffee shops inhabited by white hipsters and middle aged women. It feels a lot better and more like I'm actually living in Canada. "
"what the actual fuck is this shit? sign her email up for every newsletter you lay your eyes on, this is the most retarded shit I've seen all day and today included me attempting to study for CS 458 and utterly failing

imagine being ""flabbergasted"" at this"
"&gt; lel, how was first assignment average 65%?

u have to understand that the math requirement for econ students is not that high. There are a ton of people who learn how to take the derivative of x^2 for the first time in ECON 211. Also some econ majors are just freaking lazy. ECON is definitely a major where you can pass with minimal effort. 

But hey, IMO this is where you take advantage - these people bring down the average, and this is where you can get an insanely high grade relative to the class.


"
"He black our government and country are u fucking blind?! Come on if you guys dont care us and want to hurt us, particular at us just come on. The incident actually has no relevance with seating reserving and u just particular at us. I know u hate that but we didn’t made such mistake. Yeah you damn fake guy, just hate us and neglect the fact that we are hurt by racist. I am so fed up with the sarcastic lanauage you use to us. U don’t care us and I don’t care u just hurt each other! Have fun! U trash! "
"I don't think the age difference is small either, though. One of my fellow co-ops last summer was an Israeli at 28 years old who had just finished his compulsory service. Cool dude, did his time in armored branch as TC in a Merkava. Imagine being like 24 and in charge of a fucking tank...but also imagine losing 4 years of your life which you then have to catch up on education. Career advancement wise you're hugely behind if you ever leave your country with compulsory service/others with similar timetables. "
"What class is this for?

Usually when I get the feeling I should know something but I can't implement its because I have a poor or flawed understanding of the underlying concept. If there's an explicit concept you know they're testing e.g. a certain data structure or design pattern or something, wiki the general concept and see if that helps, even if the lecture slides themselves don't help, they can at least tell you what to google so you can learn it yourself. Otherwise go to office hours or something. GL"
"honestly, i found math 135 the most difficult course coming in as a freshman. cs 135 was pretty difficult for me too, but i barely managed to pass both. math 137 was alright. 

and honestly, if u do well in those courses, it gives u a good fundamental grasp of how to study/prepare for university courses. instead of thinking about dropping out right now, i suggest u to buckle down, concentrate and work hard.

there are some nightmare courses even after that, but youll get through it if you do well on those. "
"so what's preventing you from doing it now? from watching a movie? a tv show? etc? I mean you browse reddit right so the front page must be an absolute foreign concept to you huh? I mean you can get a basic idea of pop culture stuff just from that alone.  

You have friends so you're not socially difficult.  Just sounds like you haven't exposed yourself to news and entertainment other than music.  Like you have the book smarts just not the ""street smarts"" honestly to get through life you need a bit of both."

"Ah yessss, the multiple FOBs speeding around ring road in bmws and mercs are so docile when they nearly run people over.

Try again m8. Asians as a whole are not docile or innocent. Infinite internet examples exist that can prove asians have asshole tendencies just like every other group out there.

Plus youre comparing that to the fact these people are in Canada, and canaidans are the global standard for apologetic pushovers, so i dont think the culture makes anyone more manipulatable here.

And lastly its just sheer probability considering the number of international asian students we have on campus compared to any other area or uni, its more likely someones going to have a problem with an asian, international albeit, than with say a black or latino person"
"Put your mental health first. Wether this means taking some time off from studying in the library, going to counselling, or just engaging in something pleasurable - do it. 
I was the same way in first year - i had absolutely zero friends and only studied. I also felt dumb as shit because despite studying my ass off I was not doing nearly as well as I hoped. 
This year, a lot of my friends that were taking a fifth year in high school came to UW. Because I have been seeing them and now actually have a tiny bit of a social life I have been studying way less then last year. And guess what? I’m actually getting even worse grades BUT i can genuinely say I’m happy this semester. I’ve realized what is worth prioritizing and what is not. 
I wish you happiness. "
"There are a decent amount of drop-in clubs for different hobbies (poker, hiking, board games, D&amp;D, etc.) that encourage newcomers! You can find a full list of official clubs over at https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/clubs/listing.

Onto the self plug... 

UW Party Games Club meets up every Friday from 6 to 9. We usually have 15-40 people at our weeklys, so there's usually enough people there for any of our board games.

In addition to our board game collection of easy to learn board games, we've recently introduced video games (Smash, Overcooked, Mario Party, Mario Kart) to our club. Once December 7th rolls around, we're planning to host a Smash Ultimate marathon, and maybe a friendly tournament to end off the term. 

Look us up on Facebook if you're interested!"
"I mean.. the type of relationship you're talking about **is** friends with benefits who only sleep with each other.

I'm going to be blunt.. but dating isn't exactly a fairy tale, not these days.

There's always going to be rare exceptions but most guys will only truly commit if they are looking for a serious relationship and if they do they will be looking for someone who's basically girlfriend material (not saying you can't be, but if you're not looking for a serious relationship then automatically you aren't at this moment gf material).

If they're honest and are not looking for a serious relationship, guys will generally prefer a non-committed fwb or fuck buddies sort of arrangement. And the ones who are good enough will get it. The rest, either fake-commit or just don't get laid.

Basically, casual relationships are a much better option for girls. They get to have friends with benefits with the boyfriend label so they don't get judged for it. Guys don't care or get judged for that, so they are generally more selective about who they put the girlfriend label on.

I personally have only had either fwbs (think fairly frequent, fun hangouts that include sex) or a serious committed relationship (the kind where if you don't break up, you will move in together at the 1 or 2 year mark, and get married 1-2 years after). I don't like to have anything in-between and I know that most guys I know share the same view.

So, the solution? switch to looking for fwb OR lower standards a bit more and/or get used to rejection"

"*study = life

It will be worth it my friend. Remember, you're in this program because you enjoy the material. Set your mind to not just studying, but enjoying the material. See how that works out for you.

Consider yourself a monk. You are a physics monk. "
G&amp;T Barbers! I usually had my sister cut my hair but these days it was such a hassel to go home to get it cut. First time being at a barber ever. Nevertheless they did a great job imo! Def going back! 21$ tax inc for students us a tip you wanna be nice 
"I believe the way OSAP is given to you changed this year so now it goes automatically to UW once it's funded then any amount in excess goes to your bank account. If there's no extra, you won't get anything. Check your Quest account to see if it was paid off"
"I mean they get all pissed when you don't talk smoothly in a center or center-left way, and they also get pissed about swear words or statements that don't sound like they came straight from a lawyers office. So you basically need to write like a ted talk. "
"I think theory is like 1/3 of it this year 

How do they usually mark taxprep?? Like what if you enter the wrong number but have the correct spot 

Does going through the slides help or should I just focus mainly on the tax prep questions from homework? :/ "
"I'm in fourth-year C&amp;O now and I still use proof by contradiction far more than is necessary.  Something about it makes it easier for me to understand the logic.  Sometimes it's easier to find the direct proof once you have the contradiction proof, too."
"I'm no longer in CS, but I took Grade 12 English in summer school and was admitted in 2015 with an average in the low 90s (don't remember exactly what it was). I did pretty well on the Euclid and the CCC though, definitely do those. It's definitely possible"
"It definitely sounds frustrating, but take it up with the prof and see where you made mistakes so you can do better on your next essay. Worse comes to worse, maybe take an extra course during one of your easier terms so you don't need to graduate any later."
"Most of it is misdirected. Yes, they realise they're the problem, but they tend to pretend it's things out of their control (poor bone structure//height lel) rather than things that they have the power to change (which it usually is - get a haircut my dude)"
"QUICK AND EASY TIP:

If you don't want to work at a company, look up negative reviews on Glassdoor. Reference these in the interview and ask what they're doing to fix the issues mentioned. Don't ask them any questions related to the position or the company."
"To be fair, I don't really see much of a correlation between ECE 105 and the rest of the curriculum - I see it more as an accreditation requirement. One could be not great at 105 and still succeed in other ECE courses. (Also, what's up with the negativity?)"
"Ya, a lot of the 1a midterms for all engineering are meant to be super hard. Forces freshman to take things seriously and study hard for finals. Also weeds out people who won't be able to handle the rest of the degree. Just stick it out and keep practicing."
"Yea I agree with a lot of what you said except for that you think we're out to get eachother. Maybe some people are, not me personally. My main point however, was just that students can no longer expect to fail midterms/finals and have the curve save them. "
"You may not feel like it's a big deal but for many students, it's very hard to succeed in these circumstances. I'm not blaming the teaching, for likely her first ever class, it's not bad. But there should be some other way to properly learn all the content."
"are you microwavemasterrace's 2nd coming :O

(if anyone non-ironically believes this study with people dumber than you so you can extra cement the concepts in your mind - being able to explain something concisely and precisely requires v good understanding)"
"omnivaliant u r fuckin perfect m8.

you're a flower. you're also a rainbow and a river. you are the manifestation of all perfection and i want to i don't fucking know. i want this to not sound gay, but you are fucking perfect, omnivaliant.

ty for listening"
"unironically just read a McMaster confessions post (from healthsci or something) that was complaining about how one of their marks just dropped to a 95.

Meanwhile we're sitting in class being told by our profs that we ""only need 60s, don't worry about it""."
"""Classical mechanics"" is a misleading term because it's so broad.

we cram more material in because we don't take nearly as many physics courses as you 

we have one course for classical mechanics, and one course for E&amp;M. It's even harder than other eng physics, like Phys 115 (our 105 midterm has questions from old 115 finals)

&gt; Whats the point of making ECE harder when people taking phys 121 are probably going to continue doing physics

Because you have more courses to learn more physics, we don't. "
"Do you downvote everyone you disagree with even a little?  I'm fine with people downvoting me, it just seems like a weird thing to do here, like it makes me think you're too emotionally involved with what you're saying, but maybe I'm wrong.

Also this: ""yea yet most women don't go around saying all women are abusive"".

I didn't even say anything about this before you made that comment, why is this the first thing you jumped to, again maybe I'm wrong, but it seemed to me like you were looking for an argument."
"I mean there **are** parties but if you expect UW to be like those US college from Hollywood movies you're gonna be severely disappointed  
  
&gt; People study until 2am on weekdays. It seems like all the ""fun"" stuff happens at Laurier.  
  
you got it opposite, ""fun"" shit happens when you're away on coop making big bucks, not at UW campus  
  
&gt;Or is Waterloo really a education &gt; fun university?  
  
no, we're a reddit university, working at Google making like $11k USD/month is like our idea of ""fun"""
"nah, the course is structured in a way that we start with mips and add abstractions to it step by step to build a higher-level set of instructions to use (variables, binary operations, control statements, etc)

to do this we wrote code to compile these higher-level instructions and change them into the MIPS instructions that would correspond to them

procedures were the second last abstraction that we covered, so it used the other abstractions that we made before which made writing it all in MIPS itself hard"
"Hey bud, everyone has to start from somewhere :) . For all you know the previous co-op could have gone through exactly what you are going through earlier on in life. Be happy of the fact that your boss said you showed improvement after taking feedback and try to apply that same thinking to your next role. Seems like that fear of failure is definitely contributing to your dislike for the job so at the very least I'd try to consciously make an effort to stop thinking about that other co-op and make some concrete steps to improve by asking for feedback from your boss. Let's be honest, sure you might not get the same eval as the previous guy, but as you said, this is your first opportunity in a fast paced environment so make the most of it and look to the future."
"I won't speak to the subreddit (though I have seen it here a lot too, usually disguised as a joke), but in real life and during orientation especially, the attitude of upper years was very much ""don't have high expectations, your grades will definitely drop, but don't worry, they don't matter anyway"". A very discouraging message to send to first years. And I am fully aware of the statistics, but you shouldn't use them to encourage mediocrity. Instead, you should use those to motivate first years: tell them that it's easy to fall behind and hard to catch up in university and that they're likely going to have to work harder than they did in high school to achieve the same success. It's not the fact that the statistics are presented, it's how they are presented."
"I moderated a candidates debate recently (not in Waterloo).   Jan D'ailly attended in the audience and I spoke with him. He seemed solid. But, that's the only interaction I've had with him.

As for Karen, she's a career politician looking for a job.  She's running for regional, which has next to nothing to do with specific housing issues at the city level, here's what she had to say when asked about student housing (crossposted in another thread):

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;Students  form an important part of our  community and our future - we have three  excellent educational  institutions that bring them here, and we always  hope they choose to  stay (as many already have), and become part of that  “permanent  population” to which you refer.

A  safe  and well-maintained supply of rental housing is key to making that   case, so it is absolutely essential that we all support the efforts of   our municipal property standards personnel. If you have a specific   concern, I urge you to contact your local municipality (city or   township) and make a report.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Two paragraphs to avoid a direct question.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want an eye opener, go look at the region's website and look at the tax increases they've implemented over the last 2 years."
"Well for starters you are definitely still depressed. 

As for everything else. Can't you just tell your family to stop paying for everything? You hate them, so might as well cut them out of your life completely. Besides survival is a motivation to get out of depression. At least it was like that for me. When faced with starvation and homelessness, depression had to take a backseat. I mean it is still in the car, but at least it's not the thing that drives you. 

And depression got you all the way fucked up into thinking that you've already ruined your life simply because you feel like you are not up to par. There are plenty of things that ruin people's lives and not being up to par isn't one of them. Who even is everyone else? You say you have no friends or siblings, so who exactly are you comparing yourself to? Are they at least people that notice that you haven't stacked up against them?  

Do you know how long people live on average? You are probably in your 20s, you have plenty of time to get your shit together. And you don't have to be on anybody's timeline except yours. So if that means it takes a few years or even decades before you get it together, so be it. That's not gonna destroy you. 

Lastly therapy. You really need to alter the way your brain thinks. Just like you said that it wasn't always this way, you are right. It wasn't. If you can wire your brain to this depressed mindset, you can rewire it to something better. That's is something that should tell you that the state you are in is not fixed. "
"Have you heard the phrase ""*Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate*""? It's from Dante's famed **Inferno**, a tale of a journey through Hell, and can be translated as ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.""

You may think marmoset and ECE150 is just your average ECE course, when its true meaning is considerably more profound than that. The professors, like Dante, wished to illustrate to the common man what would come with the rejection of spiritual values. The course is a representation of the nine circles of hell, a journey towards the soul of god. 

Every step of the way, more and more souls are lost. You start off with the basics, HelloWorld, Bitwise, and people feel fine. You dive a bit deeper. Statistics cause a few to look around in worry. They're told that they're worrying too much. Things are not difficult. Things will be fine. 

Then ECBraking hits. 100 souls are crushed amidst a single weekend. The cohort looks around in horror, as those that were once proud students ready to take on anything were now a shadow of their former self. The journey continues. 

Sorted. Bisection. StringToInt. Projectile. Those that still remain wonder if it was just a bump in the road. Things appear to be getting better. Hope resurfaces, and somehow, amidst the treacherous caverns, optimism lives. 

Then FileReading occurs, reminding the group that this *is* Marmoset. There is no end to the madness. As the spiral deeper down into despair, they see the next monstrosity in their path. FileWriting. 

Their sorrows can still be heard, forever trapped in the flames of the abyss. For those that lived on through it, it has become a taboo matter, something to never speak of again. 

Marmoset is no joke. It's something that represents more than what we, as lowly mortals, can possibly comprehend. To truly embrace it for what it means, you must cast away your humanity and allow yourself to be taken by the gods. 

""*I’ vegno per menarvi a l’altra riva
ne le tenebre etterne, in caldo e ’n gelo*"", it spoke. Those that lived, listened. "

"Would be super lame if the Bomber closed and the university was left with zero pubs. UW used to support two pubs back in the day (plus POETS) and it was just as Engineering/Math/CS focused. Something's got to change, granted, but sounds like poor management."
"Would have had mid-high 90 average in first year if I didn't I shit the bed in finals (bought civ 5 1A exam season, bought diablo 3 1B exam season) and ended with low 90s. 

But the vast majority of people drop at least a little. Average is around ~16% drop."
"Yep, it's so refreshing to hear people's experiences with different courses too. There's plenty of inbetween time to talk. There are people I raided with that used to be super shy, and then when I started talking to them, are actually hella cool and chill af"
"I don’t think I’m asexual (maybe even more sexual than average? Although that has recently changed), not aromantic based on what you described. I have had a boyfriend in the past, but haven’t been able to meet anyone I like for a very long time now.

Perhaps I do take more time to warm up to people, but unfortunately it’s hard for me to get to that point since I seem to be put off so easily, especially in the beginning stages. :/ 

I feel that I might be like this in day to day relationships as well. "
"I saw Dr. Cy at his office on 135 Union St E last year. The time between my referral and my first appointment with him was about four weeks, which isn't bad at all compared with a lot of other offices/cities. If you're having problems getting a referral from your primary physician and you think your acne's bad enough, you could also consider getting a second opinion at a walk-in clinic somewhere else in Waterloo. Acne sucks, especially when it's cystic and recalcitrant. Hope you get referred to someone soon! "
"I took it last term with EZ and blais so idk how useful this will be.

 but we had a true and false section with stuff like order notation/loop analysis.. plus some random shit.

2nd question was algorithm analysis. basically given a bunch of algorithms find the worst case runtime and reccurance relation (using master thrm or reccurance tree) and ranking different algorithms based on the worst case runtime

3rd question was divide and conquer

4th was a greedy question

5th was a dynamic programming question."
"No problem! That's really good, I've heard that competitive math skills are very transferrable to competitive programming ones (and not the other way around) so that will help. I used to do quite a few of these problems/contests before, and although training for and doing these contests really interest me, unfortunately a pretty substantial side project I'm working on is keeping me from having the free-time to do so. Might get back into to it in the future if time allows it. Either way, best of luck to you :)"
"Since you're saying you're probably not attractive enough for tinder, I'd probably start by working on your confidence. You'd be suprised how good you can look when you groom yourself (wash/moisturize skin regularly, get a good haircut, keep teeth white). Also fashion goes a long way, don't just wear what you see other people wearing, get cloths that flatter your particular body type (you can probably find guides online). Lastly if you want to go a step farther working out regularly can make anyone look good."
"So, there were originally going to be stores run through the same government organization that runs the LCBO. The conservatives when they came in scrapped that plan in favor of having privatized stores, however that meant that they needed more time to figure out the logistics and legislation of those private stores, hence the later roll out of the stores.


Personally, I don't swing very heavy on the conservative side of the spectrum. However I'm happy the stores will be privatized, despite the annoying wait."
"Of course that resonates. I've interviewed thousands of people, and only remember a handful. I think that applies to every job. I assume devs won't remember every single line of code they've written. Cashiers won't remember every single transaction they handle or every customer who comes into their lane. 

You try to make every interaction count, so that even after you forget someone, at least you'll know that in the moment, you did your best. Don't get me wrong, some people don't do their best nor do they try. That's why they're bad at their jobs. 

Recruitment is only a part of HR though. Candidates are like acquaintances. I'll remember the ones who make the biggest impact, the ones I fight for or the ones who are so bad I'd make a note to avoid them. The good ones, you'll put in effort to try to win them over as a friend. The employees, those are the people you really build relationships with. You remember every big moment like when someone tells you they're expecting their first child or tells you about a significant loss. When you have to let someone go and end that relationship. When someone opens up to you with secrets they've never shared. When you fight for these people to help them be more successful, sometimes without them knowing. You'll remember those moments. 

So even though I don't remember every acquaintance, it doesn't stop me from trying to be nice to them in the moment. 

I will say though that I've never not loved my job. At the beginning of my career, I promised myself that if I ever called in sick without being sick, I'd look for a new job. Yes, sometimes it gets frustrating but it's only frustrating because you still care. 

The HR professionals who don't give a shit about their candidates...they suck at their jobs and should not be in HR. "
"- You have too many bullet points in your summary of qualifications. Try to stick to 4-5. I would take out the Microsoft Office one. It's expected from everyone and not that impressive. Tailor this to the job description and ideal candidate summary for each job
- Work Experience #1. Briefly explain the corporate employee privilege program in case it's unique to this company. Describe it in a way that shows key skills used. What did you screen the companies/organizations for? Which tools did you use for this task? ""upsides and downside of the companies"".... this sounds very subjective. I'd definitely rephrase
- ""Supported financial advisors..."" The word supported is like the word assisted. It's vague and doesn't tell the person reading our resume anything. What did you actually do? Use a stronger action verb
- ""Worked closely with senior staff.."" Again very vague. The second half of your bullet point is much stronger. Start the sentence with ""solved clients' inquiries...""
- ""Assisted private wealth consultants..."" You know the drill at this point. Use a better verb that pin points a skill
- ""Organized a study abroad information.."" Can you list some specific tasks and skills used here?
- ""Brought in a variety of new students"" You can make this sound nicer by calling it ""increased attendance""
- ""Scouted competitor's social media platforms"" What was the result of this? Why did you do it? Did it help you achieve something? Also which tools did you use to do this? Same deal with ""evaluating social media accounts""
- For your project, your bullet points are too short. Give examples and details. For instance, how did you improve the program's efficiency with a macro? Remember to include an end result? What did you achieve with the task and why does it matter?
- I know you redacted your awards/achievements, but make sure to give a line or two explaining what the award is and how/why you won it
- Explain your certifications. Consider removing them if they are not relevant to your job. Instead add other bullet points elsewhere"

If you're working in tech or for money just to get a girl, you also need to re-evaluate your life (and maybe change careers if you don't enjoy what you're doing).

"What kind of lease are you looking for? Short term (up to 12 months) or long term (2-4 years)? If you're looking for a short term lease on a used car, I would advise against anything other than an entry-level car. If you're looking long-term I wouldn't go for any car older than 2 years or you're looking at high interest rates. Honestly, I think buying is the best option, because when you sell it, the difference you spend between buy and sell will probably be much smaller than the amount you'd spend on a lease."
"&gt;Is having the Laurier Co-Op System + a BBA degree for resume fuel worth sticking out the BBA degree?

I've heard negative things about Laurier's co-op system (for CS at least), but I'd assume it's better than not having access to any system. Without co-op, you'd have to make sure to put in the time to find co-ops/internships.

&gt;Is a BBA degree and the business-focused Laurier co-op system very useful for someone looking to work purely in CS?

No.

&gt;Or, would it be better to put that effort towards taking more CS/Math electives in regular CS and graduating a year earlier, plus having the benefit of actually enjoying everything I am studying?

If you're not interested in the BBA side at all, it'd be better for you to devote that time to CS/Math instead."
"For your questions:

1. No. This is very hard and you might get stuck in a major you didnt like. I would bet that at least 150 people try this and only like 20 succeed.

2. CS you want a higher average. Other than that its a crapshoot. As for math you should get in alright. By the way, data science is as hard to get into as CS if i recall correctly

Random question, but why is pure math listed? Its not really related to the others except tangentially (though going from pmath to the software industry is not a crazy feat). Research the applied math or CO departments too - they might interest you.

3: Doing good enough to make it to the CMO or CCO would help. Other contests like the AMC12, SIN, and CAP are good too. I think the CAP is what got me into waterloo tbh"
"I’m in 4B cs and have taken 4 courses per study term since 2A (except for 5 this term). I also took 1 online bird course on some co-op terms. I’m too lazy to do the math but you should see if doing 4:1 would let you graduate “on time”. It’s not a big deal, anyway, just take the amount of courses you can handle effectively and don’t worry about when you graduate. I haven’t had a single employer care about the number of courses I’ve taken and I’ve had some pretty good co-ops. 

If you do decide to do 4:1 just know that it’s more expensive. Taking a single online course in CS on a co-op term is much more expensive for the course than if you took it as a 5th course on a study term. It’s probably worth it, though, if it helps you learn better. "
"- Add additional bullet points to experiences that talk about general skills like teamwork, organization, planning, critical thinking etc. Tease out what a boring sounding last like delivering pizza gave you valuable experience.

"&gt;they changed because she didn't want to sleep with them again

That's not true. She just said they changed and were only talking about sex. She was talking to them after. She didn't like it that they only wanted sex.

&gt;the men took their initial hookup as an excuse to degrade her in future conversations. And apparently asking for basic human decency is doing too much?

I won't say it wasn't degrading, who knows maybe she got really unlucky with all the guys she hooked up with, but it's unlikely. But I've seen this happen over and over again. It's just how guys work. You hook up with a girl, why would you see her anything other than sexually? You weren't friends before, you don't have feelings. Your mutual interest is supposed to be sexual. So of course they will only talk about sex.

But for whatever reason, it doesn't sit well with most girls. I've seen it in my personal life and it comes from within. They convince themselves that you're degrading them or treating them as subhuman. It's not what's happening at all. If you equate only wanting sex to degradation or being subhuman, maybe you should revisit how you view sex or the alternative is to just not have sex without feelings because it clearly doesn't work for you. If a girl only wants a guy  for sex and tells him about how much she wants to have sex with him all the time, he won't feel subhuman, he'll feel superhuman 99% of the time.

So let's not demonize guys just because you don't understand them. I personally try my best to understand girls I've been with. Sure they are not the same, but you see patterns. So, if I don't want anything serious, I'll make it clear, and try to find a balance between the sexual and non-sexual aspect of things. But most guys don't really understand it, and more importantly they really don't have a responsibility to understand it. If they haven't agreed to anything, they're entitled to just do things from their own male perspective. If you want something else, you have to bring it up.

&gt;She just wants to have causal sex in peace without men either harassing her, or treating her like she's subhuman.

Harassment is never okay. But not only is there so much more to this than simple unwanted harassment, but it's also not about her case. I almost regret the title. It's just what made me write this post, but it barely has anything to do with the post itself. I'm talking about things in general.

&gt;Hell, she would much rather they leave her ass alone, ghost her or whatever (this is what she herself stated).

I will only address this one more time, but try to be as open minded as I'm being while replying to you, and consider this.

Say she wanted nothing to do with them after hooking up and they kept harassing her for more sex. Why would she complain about them treating her as ""subhuman""? Her only problem would be to get them off her back and if she still wants to generalize and bash on guys, she would have been talking about how guys don't take a hint, and how a one night stand should stop there. But her entire post and comments is about how guys treated her after.

Let's be real here, she wanted them to give her affection and not only talk about sex. Sure they have to leave her alone now, it's pathetic that they won't. But she doesn't want them anymore and wants them to leave her alone because they just want sex, it's obvious if you consider what she was complaining about. I bet she wouldn't want the same if they acted differently.

&gt;And it is fucking stupid that you launched into this whole rant on the back of that post.

Thanks for calling what I did stupid. A whole lot of people don't. But it wasn't even about that post. It was just what pushed me to finally get this off my chest. But really it's because of what I've been observing from other people and my own personal life."

"3B here. I found first year really difficult because of the sheer volume of new material plus overall changes in my life, but looking back I'm amazed by how rudimentary all the information is and how much I've learned since, although I don't feel any different"
Correct. I am just saying that I don't think I have bad anxiety. I sometimes fall into cognitive traps that everyone experiences. It is completely manageable for me and has been for most of my life. There were more things going on that I don't want to divulge.
"Did you lose your virginity?

In all seriousness, it's been 4 weeks and you still don't have your SSN? That sounds slow. From what I remember, they will not write down your SSN for you, but if you ask for it and have proof it's you, they'll read it out to you."

"I suggest keeping food on you like protein bars, fruits or nuts. If you're looking for cheap snacks you can get bagels, patties or cookies. As unhealthy as these are, it is better than not eating anything. Take care of your body before you're forced to do it. "
"I winged the midterm, surprisingly I didn't fail (thanks to the adjustments). I don't think the midterm even ended up counting at all in my final grade for the course.

The course is a shit show, especially with Mansour; nobody can tell you how fucked you are."
"I've met a couple people who have done 4 course terms, including myself, and we're all doing alright co-op wise. Also from personal experience, I've failed STAT 230 and took it online over a co-op term which was an alright experience. You're not alone my dude."
"If they are all course based programs, do this ^

For any thesis based, decide from which prof/research group you want to work with. Also the topic could matter too. AI stuff has kicked up a fair bit in Toronto. Waterloo has Quantum. Not sure about South Cali."

Um.. not wanting a relationship doesn’t exactly make you a bad person. Depends on how you treat them during and after. Also depends on if you tell them things that aren’t true just to sleep with them. It’d be best to make it clear that’s all you want. 
"Yeah, no. My final grade helps me find out what my relative strengths are, so I think it is pointless. All this would do is bred more problems.  Plus it's a terrible motivator since it doesn't matter if everyone gets 90s, folks still have to be at the bottom. "
"&gt;  there are a variety of people there.

lol I refer to you the idea of [tech monoculture](https://medium.com/california-countercultures/silicon-valley-counterculture-or-monoculture-470795736383), one of the few things that are not a meme about SV.

Among them [92% of software peeps there are male](https://splinternews.com/survey-says-92-percent-of-software-developers-are-men-1793846921).  So, have fun getting laid unless you're a fag like me (I guess if you're a chick it's ok, but they won't hire you so.. )"
"If they are pressuring you to accept an offer before rankings open, just accept it and renege later on if you decide you would prefer to take another offer on Waterloo Works. You should probably accept the offer before rankings open, since that is pretty common for the bigger companies to require you to do that, but if I was you I wouldn't feel bad going back on the offer if a better one came along - it's their own fault for trying to get around the coop system and get their offers out ahead of other companies."
"**Joining continuous gang soon.**

[Here's my resume](https://www.docdroid.net/yFYIZDm/resume-2a-v2-censored.pdf).

I'd really appreciate any feedback/roasts of my resume so I can improve.

I used it to apply to dev jobs and some UI/UX and PM positions. I censored a tiny bit of information. The only relevant link I got rid of was the design portfolio, which had screencaps of a website I made as well as digital illustrations I made (without relevance to UI/UX).

Major concerns I have are the length (2 pages), and putting my GPA on it. Other than that, I don't know why my well ran so dry this time for WaterlooWorks, and it'd be great to hear your take on how I can improve for the future. I genuinely want to get better and I'll take all of your opinions seriously. "
"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights -&gt; open dem borders cause everyone deserves access to what you made -&gt; what you made gets destroyed -&gt; enrichment

Statements like these were made during a time where Western democracies had near absolute control of the globe and were pushing ""democracy"" - usually in the form of some sketchy puppet - on everyone. That hegemony is dead and now some insane people in the West are misinterpreting these mission statements and the democratically dying yet economically growing southern hemisphere is pragmatically eager to capitalize on that weakness. 

Or more likely, these statements were made by people who want the West to die. Europe, etc seriously need to fuck off with the virtue signalling. It isn't 1905, our position isn't secure enough to keep fucking around like its the 60s. Although if we're going to be part of a new imperial empire I'd prefer being subjugated by East Asia instead of the likes of May and Merkel and their middle earth pets. "
"&gt; What well of arrogance do you tap into to believe you know better than the IPCC, the leading international body on climate change, and the scientists which inform their work?

I've been watching them change their minds every 2 years for nearly 2 decades.

They thought we'd have no polar ice caps by 2010. What happened? They grew.

I understand the math behind their modeling, I know why their predictions are such garbage. 

I am still under the impression that their modeling is getting better, and they may be right this time, but what difference does it make? You'll just send me stupid strawman comics when I tell you what actually has to be done to fix the problem.

Hint: it's not a carbon tax in a country with a carbon footprint like 1% (if that) the size of China's. 

Your comic is actually so incredibly far off base.

It's more like:

&gt; guys climate change is a big problem

&gt; yea, I know my entire lifestyle directly causes man-made climate change but let's not talk about that lmao

&gt; oh, some alternatives? wow you must think you're some sort of genius, loser

The self-awareness just isn't there for everyone.

&gt; You're a fucking joke. Hope you're just being facetious, but don't expect much from a casual racist

Haha. Think whatever you want. @ me in 5 years when the ""science"" changes to a contradictory conclusion again.

Worst case scenario, California ends up under the ocean. I fail to see the problem, as a ""casual racist"" �� (it's actually the white people from California I dislike the most)"
"Some of these aren't actually that far-fetched. 

&gt; Every path leading away from the school needs a rail crossing, so that a train can pass during tense or dramatic moments.

There's literally a railway line running through the engineering department. Once ION starts running, this will be perfect. 

&gt; A mysterious transfer student should join every class at least once a month.

This happens fairly routinely, at least in engineering, with people transferring all over the place and people randomly showing up for class that you've never met before. 

&gt; Huge, international celebrities should be seeded throughout the student body, yet be unrecognizable due to wearing glasses and/or a hat.

I have almost 50 followers on Twitch, do I count?

&gt; Your adorable younger sibling should show up the first day to bring you the lunch you forgot at home, to your immense embarrassment.

To be perfectly honest, I would not be surprised if this has happened before. 

&gt; In fourth year, it should be revealed that the school is actually a magic/mecha/demonic/psychic/angel/ghost training institute.

Math is basically magic to me since I can't figure out how it works at all, Mechatronics/Mechanical are basically doing the mecha part.

&gt; Actually, mecha should play a much more prominent role in campus life in general.

Come visit RoboHub in E7!!

&gt; The entire CS department should be missing and presumed trapped inside a computer program/simulation of some variety.

They're trapped inside MC, isn't that more or less the same thing? 

&gt; I wouldn't mind if we had school uniforms, particularly if they gave you enhanced strength and/or were sentient creatures.

Given how many people seem to religiously wear their departmental hoodies, they may as well be our school uniforms. 

&gt; Or even just a chill cafe where you're always the only one there, besides the cute and/or hunky staff?

Not gonna say anything about the staff in particular, but ShareTea over under Blair House is usually fairly chill with not many people around. "

"&gt; Life doesn’t interest me.

Your program doesn't interest you, and you are confusing UW for life.  Drop out.

&gt; but no one understands me.

It's not other people's job to understand you, it's your job to explain yourself.  You failed so far.  Drop out."
"&gt;A lot of recruiters told me I'm shit out of luck since I'm not in WW  
  
lmfao not true at all, it's a numbers game, not being in WW means you're not restricted to the 50 app limit  
  
I'll take 600 app : 30 interviews to 50 WW app : 10 interview any day "
"&gt;I think part of it might also be that you have to be superhuman to even consider trying to solve the challenge problems

or a delusional idiot like me staring at the problems hoping for divine inspiration cause i know imma fail the midterm : )

&amp;#x200B;"
"75% is perhaps a little too good to be true - averages like to sit in the 60s (I think the highest average for any of our classes last term was 78%). 

It sounds like he gave you a reasonably easy midterm, so your final probably will be a bit harder than liked."
"Fun fact: a lot of parking enforcement officers in kw4rent buildings dont give a shit and dont submit parking tickets to the city. If they still dont show up in the system days later you dont have to pay it

Source: from a few clerks who handles parking tickets"
"Go to the student success center. They have workshops and one-on-one appointments exactly for that. Academic coaches can help you figure out how to get motivated to study, what study methods work best for you, how to plan out your studying, where to study, etc."
"I agree the enjoyment is probably the biggest factor 

I've met so many cs students (who should be in pure math) that found out they don't like cs or programming at all or students that have completely different interests completely like visual arts or business"
"I can guarantee MATH 135 is easier it is now than it was like 5-6 years ago.

 When I was a frosh 2 years ago i was scared absolutely shitless because of its reputation coming in. Turns out shit was watered down theorem sheets were given and the avg was like 75"
"I didn't know the racist guy was trying to save seats. In light of that, he is also wrong for trying to save seats, on top of his racism towards the girls.

That doesn't excuse the girls for trying to save seats too though. They shouldn't have done that either."
I was a little bit of an introvert in high school so I knew I actually wanted friends from the get-go. I always talked to the person beside me. Met a bunch of people that way. Still do if something notable happens during class and none of my friends are around.
"I'm guessing its a rank. I didn't bomb the interviews and I solved their algorithm problem pretty quickly with like one hint (and it was a LC Hard), but I did mess up some conceptual questions. I think this is probably an offer otherwise its a pretty huge bait."
"Lol unless they're factoring getting addicted to league into their studies then I'm not a very good sample :/

EDIT: Also what they're saying about 90s being rare in Alberta is true, out of all the people I knew from Calgary only about 10 of them  at least a 90"
"Same here, especially with that ""full vs. associate professor"" debate. It's something you apply for, she just didn't want to do it. Plus all those lies about there being higher wages. Unless Scott Leatherdale lied to us, which I wouldn't ever see that happening"
"Semi-relevant event: just before the group theory final exam, prof read out the usual instructions (the exam is 2.5 hrs, no one may leave during the last 30 min etc), then ask: any questions? One guy: yeah, what's a group? The whole classed laughed really hard."
"The amount of airborne bacteria will be inconsequential compared to your hands, I mean do you really think that there are as many bacteria in the air as on your ass/dick or the toilet/urinal handle you just touched? 

Wash your hands man, that’s disgusting.

"
"The average average, not the minimum cutoff mark, so it doesn't say at all that individuals can't get in with lower marks (or that people can't get rejected with higher ones). This was coming directly from the admissions staff to students working at open houses"
"Trust me when i say if YOU watch LOTR, youll fall asleep within 30 seconds.

Personally I think Marvel is a great series to get into(movies)

I have no life so i watched like all the movies at least 5 times even InfinityWar

(Iron man Trilogy at least 15 times)"
"Yeah he can't do that. You can't either. It's not okay. Don't diminish. Dr Morgan did not give consent. 

His attack on Dr Winter was more severe. And Dr Winter had no capacity to consent to what David Mackay did to her.

Dr Morgan witnessed both reported both."
"East campus is especially pedestrian unfriendly, more so in winter when you can't walk on the grass and are forced to walk across all the parking lots. Columbia's even worse, as all the intersections are designed for cars to turn quickly (wide turn radius) rather than for pedestrians to cross safely. If you feel unsafe crossing an intersection, you should definitely send a complaint to Waterloo Region - [https://casurveys.efmfeedback.com/se/5B0C5C06754FEC58](https://casurveys.efmfeedback.com/se/5B0C5C06754FEC58)"
"Judging by your past post you thought you understood things but you didn't study thoroughly or retain the material. People have different ways of studying and it depends on the course too, but you've gotta put in effort to learn.  

Professor Neufeld is honestly really approachable and understanding, I really think he would want to help you understand this better even if it's irrelevant to your field. I think you have to own up to your shortcomings and work harder and/or find help if you want to pass this course"
"It's hard to explain my desire to transfer without kinda explaining all of the events of the past year which led to me being at Western, but overall I'm just not too happy here in Engineering. While the campus here at Western is really nice, the culture and people here are just something I don't really enjoy or fit in with. Initially I thought that sort of thing was just exaggerated, but it was all pretty on the nose.

Waterloo to me was always the obvious choice for the University I liked most, but it so happened that it was also insanely competitive.  I grew up close to Waterloo, and I'm very familiar with the campus, and the kind of culture the school has, and it's one I feel I fit very well into.

I also understand how good of an engineering school is, and being interested in Tron or ECE, it's something Waterloo is known for, and I've always seen Waterloo as a clear superior option, especially with additional co-op. Western engineering just doesn't seem to offer a whole lot, unless you go into Ivey, which I'm not exactly sure is the path I want to take.

That being said I have considered what you've said in the past, and it does feel like by transferring I'd be wasting a full years tuition, rent, and time for a handful of credits. Its a tough decision which I haven't exactly made final in any way, but I thought I'd investigate my possibilities anyway. 

I'm very thankful for the response, and I understand I may be way in over my head with this. Also, how high would you say ""absolutely killing the marks game"" is?"

"For most university friends I can use FB messenger or Snapchat - but I would need my work to be able to call/text me. 

I do have my family and bf call and text me but pretty much use social media for everything else. 

Thanks for the VoIP app suggestion though!"
"I was a bystander at that time. When I saw this incident happening, there were three of them reserving only one seat. Also you’ve missed the point of OP, even if there is a seat issue, it could’ve been solved by negotiating instead of using racism language. "
"I went to UW in 1997 and this guy was doin the rounds collecting bottles back then (no vest tho).

The crazy-ish thing is, he looks exactly the same as I remember. Hadn't been around campus area in 10 years+ until lately, when I saw him it was like a time warp. "
It's only the worst outcome that I'am able to accept. Currently I'm doing well in all my courses except 246 and 239 (but the extent of difficulty i feel in 239 is within normal range as i observe). I'm getting from 80ish to near full marks in my other 4 courses.
"Set some goals that you can work towards :) 

&amp;#x200B;

IE. try learning guitar or running a 5k race or eating at every burrito place and writing an article on them. Just any task that is small or large can really bring a lot of meaning back to your life :) "
"Sure, but it is in their house correct? If I was a parent I wouldn't let my kid buy furniture off kijjiji - you don't know where it's been, it could have fleas or bedbugs, and if I have furniture in my house I want to be the one to pick it out, or at least help."
"The reason we have strict cross walks and barriers is that there were a number of pedestrians being hit. Part of this was speeding, part of it was stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

The stupidity part has gotten worse, the speeding part has generally gotten a bit better."
"There's also a question of degree, I'll leave that up to you to judge. But If you're following whatever rules there are with sharing ideas, then you're fine. If you're questioned about it, tell them the truth and reference whatever says that sharing ideas is OK."
Theres this alarm app that you can set up NFC tags on put one of the tags in the bathroom and one near the exit. The only way to silence the alarm will be to tap your phone on these tags (Or turn the phone off). Reminds you to get up and leave at the right times
"Waterloo takes the highest make between the diploma exam and class mark for everything but LA which means the marks are still prone to inflation just like Ontario ones. Also, having 90 average was not rare at all, at my high school a fair amount of people had it"
"You gotta replace the bad habit with a good habit, that has the same triggers as the bad one. For example, if you open up Reddit out of boredom in class, find something else that's productive that can fill that boredom gap (maybe reading an e-book or something)."
"tbh idk what kind of interviewer would say ""no"" to that question  
  
I've noticed it's standard procedure for all interviewer to say ""you did very well"" no matter if you did great or bombed it, there's nothing for the company to gain by saying you did bad  
  
"
"I don't, I've never been in a relationship. All I **do know** is that I'm currently happy as it is without a gf  
  
that's why I said I view it like the icing on the cake: if I have it well...fine I'll give it a try I guess? but I'm already happy as it is and I don't mind if I never have the extra icing (I'll just continuing to eat my cake)  
  
and especially when that ""extra icing"" (getting a SO) can fuck over your entire life with divorce or heartbreaks or financially ruin you or all of the above, why bother?"
"Not really. Like if they're really upset about something then yea they can blow up at me when I do some minor rule breaking like eat in the living room or something, but it's definitely a rare occurrence. IDM bc they're people too and are allowed to have bad days and its back to normal once they sort out whatever it was that's bugging them. 

Otherwise they don't get mad until I'm gone bc they still treat me like I'm 15 and don't think its any part of my responsibility to deal with their problems. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"They still know of you. You're still the person that didn't respond to an email where they told you they had a medical condition keeping them from work. They may not expect a response, this prof did, but you will be the person or persons that didn't have the decency to respond. People on UW complain they don't learn any life skills, this prof just gave you all a life lesson. A small act of kindness or courtesy goes a long way. Do what you want with that. Or continue to think of this from only your point of view. "
"&gt; How is that racist? Because it's blatantly obvious to anyone reading this that you're angry that there are Chinese immigrants in the same town as you.

Wrong. I'm mad that it's all Chinese immigrants. If UW were like 5-20% Asian I wouldn't care at all. It's the fact that I'm *the only white guy in a class of 30 students* which is alarming. 

&gt; the focus is on race

Not really. It's their behavior (culture) that bothers me. I couldn't care less what they look like etc.

&gt; Negative emotion. Hate, anger, displeasure, 

I don't ""hate"" anyone. I wouldn't move to China to be a minority, so I don't want that imposed on me here. Anger and displeasure, sure. But hate implies I blame them or something.

I just want to be around people who speak my language and share my culture. It's really not a fucking big deal. They do it all the time, but when I want a community, I'm a racist. Cool.

&gt; If I am angry at a group of people and the only reason I'm angry is directly related to their race and culture, then whether I feel so or not, I'm exhibiting racism.

Wrong again. Xenophobia != Racism. Asian countries are the most xenophobic on earth anyway. Especially Japan. And I think that's great for them. It's just unfortunate we can't have that for whatever reason.

&gt; Everything you do and say has an effect on other people in the room, and it doesn't matter your intent, it matters what they feel and hear.

Don't really care tbh. This is the reality I live on a daily basis. If that upsets you then fuck off? I'm not changing my mind. I don't like being around foreign people all the time. 

&gt; Returning to the topic of racism, just because you don't think something is racism doesn't mean you're correct

I know. Everything is racist in 2018 and I'm white so I'm blind to it blah blah... Do you realize how incredibly condescending you're being? Do you realize how incredibly intellectually lazy and dishonest it is to just throw the word ""racist"" at everything white people say about anyone but other white people? For fuck sake."

"I know you're being sarcastic, but I did graduate with a physics degree from UWaterloo and I did interact with Dr. Strickland, so it is rather special to be able to have known a Nobel Laureate.  It's doubly so when it's from the very department I graduated from. "
"I think it's just a different way of thinking, and because it doesn't fit well into a 9-5 capitalist structure it is deemed a mental illness.

Meanwhile, the majority of smart people I know are probably closer to being ADHD in many ways than being ""neurotypical""."
"I would just say that it seems really odd to put the Finance part of ""Actuarial Science - Finance"" when no other part of your resume says anything about how you might have expertise/knowledge/interest in finance other than it just being kind of related to ActSci."
"It's cause of people like you that there's a stigma around this. You should feel very bad about making the world a worse place.

Edit: whoever downvoted this comment, I will find you. And when I do, one of us is swallowing the other one whole. You've been warned."
"It's okay, it's just your first term, shit happens. Don't give in already, only way you can solve it is try to forget what has happened, you can't change it. However, you can change what's to come, try harder and do your best from this point forward. 


Good luck"
"Lol I think everyone is just so sleep deprived (me included) that they forget that even when getting 8 hours of sleep, one can be sleepy throughout the day. 
Doesn’t hurt to visit your doctor about it if you really want to but there’s def no reason to panic  "
"Tbh, I enjoyed it more than my other LC interviews. It was more of a discussion and in his words ""he wanted to see what it would be like working with me"", so we just talked about a bunch of things. He even told me to take a 5 minute break and get some water lol. "
"That's not bad really.  Also the only reason you're saving rest a us to avoid strangers which is equivalent to racism.  Sohrt form?  Who cares, this is chikdishness on both of you not racism lololol.  Racism is when I kill your dad because he didn't give me a cow"
"The issue with ""affording"" it is that we're running this growing loss out of what seems like savings (which is not a sustainable practice).

Personally I don't want to see Bomber go, and I think it brings benefit to our campus (life) but we need to correct path. "
"You still didn't answer why you are taking 6 courses. Hell, even 5 + job hunting is difficult for a normal person. Take it easy and reduce the course load next term. If you have other plan like graduating early or paying cheaper tuition overall, then toughen up. "
"only thing I can think of is to wait after class? like watch her to see where she goes then try to start up a casual conversation, maybe about the class. seems like the only option to me unless you can find her on social media and message her����‍♀️"
"I don't understand your question? Looks more like a complaint to me than a question. 

I don't get the part about interview prep, the course isn't meant to be some tutorial for CTCI or leetcode. 

And projects not being in line with lectures is normal since you don't really need course material to do first couple projects (usually implementation of a variation of linked list and a stack or queue I think?), eventually lectures and projects sync up when you get to tree stuff, but some stuff may vary by Prof I guess."
"Investment banking, quant finance, being a doctor (in the US), being a lawyer (not at first), being a successful entrepreneur. All of these examples will give you BANK.

Other, easier options that will still probably make 6 figures within 5 years of work experience are Software (especially in the US), finance, sales (if you're good at it), some engineering programs (might require Masters/MBA to reach 6 figures, depends on industry).

These are just some examples, there are really tons of ways to get rich nowadays."
"Luckily I didn’t have that problem at my school. Yes there was the occasional bathroom smoker, but pretty rare. And no, I didn’t go to a small highschool, we had almost 3k students. The only reason why cigs aren’t straight up banned, is because of the amount of donations these huge companies make to political parties during elections as “gifts” but we all know what that is for. It’s really sad to 18-19 year old smoking outside buildings everyday slowly killing themselves everyday. Hurts me to see that "
"The places I worked at were mainly financial. So I'd be doing Software development or DevOps at these places. Not to belittle these places or anything, but they just didn't feel particularly challenging. I'd say it still counts towards experience, but I wouldn't call them top tier. 

I've been packing a number of side projects and I plan on doing some more. It's nice that I have something to show, but so far they haven't boosted my application as much as I thought it would.  Still I'll probably work on some more. "
"&gt;even if you're a lame blanco/mzungu/gringo from fucking WCI

WCI is the birthplace of a few real ass hood ass niggas like myself, and if i hear one MORE WORD about wci i will not hesitate to siphon funds to shin bet and have them start a race war wherever the fuck you are in africa. Normally I'd bet on the whites winning but that's ""the enemy's"" turf. They know the land, its home field advantage. I know multiple shin bet agents on a first name basis. Ever heard of Jeff Bezos?

I mean i hated most of the enormous faggots that went to that school and thought about shooting it up once, but its like talking shit about your bitch mother who always beat you: sure you're a victim but are you really gonna call your mother all those nasty mean words?

Did you go to WCI?"
"I sincerely hope this is fake.  But in case its not, here is something you need to know.  The way you are going about this is very juvenile.  Its what you expect from someone in junior high who has a ""crush"", is full of uncontrollable hormones and emotions, and just genuinely doesn't know how to deal with that situation.   
  
So first of all, this doesn't work.  Nothing is less attractive than a junior high student awkwardly asking you out with silly games.  Second, its just bad human behaviour to force other people to put up with your inability to handle yourself like a proper human being.  Other people, like this girl, don't want to put up with your awkward ambush attempts during a class that they paid for.  Nor should she have to.  
  
If you genuinely have a possibility of having a connection with this girl, then you don't have to worry about silly gimmicks and games.  Strike up a normal conversation with her.  And if you get along, you'll both keep talking and eventually you might find out you want to date.  
"
"I prefer it. But a large part of that could be family and friends being there.

The scenery out west is very different. Calgary is great because the mountains are right there; it's not like [Vancouver where they're part of the downtown skyline](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/EGMDDC/view-down-burrard-street-in-the-financial-district-of-downtown-vancouver-EGMDDC.jpg), it's an hour or so to Banff and a bunch of lakes, but you get what you pay for (Vancouver is mucho expensive). But my parents live in the west of the city and I wake up every morning to the mountains off in the distance. It's beautiful to see them around sunset in the Signal Hill area.

There's a decent bit to do in the cities. They're a lot slower, and nothing like Toronto, but those natural amenities are pretty great. I used to head to WinSport (Canada Olympic Park) after school for a quick few snowboard runs back in high school. Calgary comes alive around Stampede time, and the summers have beautiful weather with very little rain and great temperatures, so you can head out for drinks without needing to drive everywhere. In the winter it is obviously much colder, but the sky is still blue so you get the vitamin D that makes you feel good. I'd say Calgary is one of the best places to own a convertible, because you can drive it with the roof down year round (except for when it gets slushy right around 0C, because you don't want that crap in your interior) provided you have a good heater.

Not sure what exactly you're looking for, but Calgary ranks pretty highly on my list of places in Canada. It's close between that and Vancouver for the best place I've lived here; I always want to move back to Vancouver when I fly through, because it looks beautiful from the window of a plane, but then I remember that when I lived there it basically rained 24/7, and I see the property prices and get sad. But all things considered (aforementioned stuff but also taxes, salary, etc), I'd take the west coast over Toronto or Montreal for sure, let alone the dumpster that is Waterloo."

"Best time: got there 30 minutes earlier than expected. (12:30-14:00)

Worst time: had to wait for the next bus, got there 2 hours late. (15:30-19:30)

Just don't take it during rush hour and you should be alright. Its usually what I take if I need to go to Toronto"
"HOLY SHIT! I forgot that this thread is even a thing.

3B failure. I have jackshit to talk about, but I still want to try my best. Here we go:

"I assumed hate was a hyperbole, if someone geniunely hates someone's guts then that's pretty hard to turn around, but if they just think someone is a bit weird or awkward then that's not so bad.

And ha ha, yeah same. I basically never talk to people in class too."
"I chose King street because other than that small strip in Uptown, it’s been mostly forgotten about. That intersection at King and University is so dangerous to cross. Midtown is basically a dead zone. And anywhere south of Kitchener market barely has sidewalks "
"I didn't either, the course was very close to ""these are formulas given these variables, you can just solve problems like this"" 

It also was a required course in high school, and if OP did well there and still doesn't understand chemistry, something is wrong ... "
"I don't like walking mine on campus. Too many people stop me to ask to post her and when I want to walk, I want to walk. 

The only time I being her to walk on campus is if I'm taking her somewhere on campus (i.e. waiting to meet with someone for coffee on campus)"
"I think twice a day is overkill unless you go the gym or something and that 1 proper shower a day is standard.
So, I think you're just over-reacting due to being too self-concious.

But I wouldn't know because I also often blindly assume that people don't like me."
"If you can't find something to be proud of, find a bad quality and fix it. Even if fixing it doesn't make you proud of the quality, you can be proud that you had what it takes to fix it.

Since, it's easier to find something bad about anything than something good."
"Never ever ever trust lazy overpaid imcompetent powertripping uni bureaucrats (or any bureaucrats for that matter), as they have literally zero accountability in their actions, as they're protected from ever being fired, reassigned, or replaced by tenure or unions"

But due to the already pathetically low level of social skills people possess at this school, if you're attractive, you also become intimidating and/or unapproachable. Especially as a girl. "
"No, but I took a year off due to my physical health going to absolute shit out of nowhere.

Well I failed rlly bad in the first 2 years and now i learnt that the key is to not give a fuck about what ppl think and stop feeling bad for stuff u can’t change and do what u know u have to do from now on ur still young and u can still change it around ya know
You can but you should probably word it better than you just worded it in your post. You can be like... “hey thanks for scheduling the interview and it was great interviewing at X. Just wondering when will i hear back with results as i am on a tight schedule” 
"You were a student trustee in Niagara, NOT Waterloo. You are new to this area and do not know the WRDSB. Furthermore, you are a CS student and barley have time as it is, so I doubt you would be able to prioritize the work of a trustee. For these reasons, I am out."
"You will come to Waterloo for computer science, or you want to? Anything below 90 is way too low to even think about getting accepted. If you can't get 90s in high school you're gonna get murdered by uwaterloo CS courses.

I'd say your chances are approximately 0."
"You’re right on point with that argument. Unfortunately, you’re still in the combative stage, where you think you can talk reason to these people. Just don’t, it’s a waste of time.


Here’s a law of power for you: Think as you like but behave like others"

"I'm cool with most of what they do, but why BMWs? I've owned a number of cars in my life, and the BMW was the worst car i ever owned. My friend had an M4 and it had nonstop issues. The interiors are garbage, they're slow as balls, the exterior is nice however and that's their only selling point. Back in the 90s they were great, but for todays standards they are absolute trash. There are so many better cars on the market for the same price. Ever since having a bmw, i will forever judge BMW owners as absolute morons."
"Oh god, that citizenship stripping bill was insane.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think many people reading any of my writing realize I'm a small c conservative.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want change without good reason, but that ship sailed long ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my time at Waterloo, I constantly had my opinions challenge me, and it turns out everything I thought was a debate was pretty tightly already resolved. I'm not left leaning because I'm a leftist, I'm left leaning because its what the fucking data says."
"The article that you linked specifies that it is talking about within the cubicle, don’t think you can extrapolate the effect to the whole bathroom.

Also you should be drying your hands nearly right after washing them so I don’t see how that is relevant. 

Don’t know what you were trying to highlight by bringing up the nonovirus but if anything it highlights you should wash your hands because of how contagious it is.

Can’t believe that I have to make the argument that you should wash your hands in 2018..."
"if it's similar comp, I would go for SF  
  
if you want tech, SF is the place to be, the tech culture as prob as best as you can ask
  
the weather is prob as best as you can ask too  
  
housing is beyond brutal tho, if you have corporate housing take it, unless they make you share rooms  
  
SF, the city itself is kinda trash yeah, most people don't live in SF and commute by BART or Caltrain, the surrounding region are all beautiful  
  
TL;DR: if you're a social animal go NYC, if you're a tech animal come to SF"
"Okay no matter what, you've gotta go to the interview. Now that you're there here's what you can do:
- Ask them if you can do an 8 month coop but not a consecutive 8 months. So 4 and 4 split over 2 separate terms.
- Suck at the interview so they don't give you the offer (not recommended it makes you look bad) 
- Be honest with them and tell them you're not that interested and don't want to waste their time

If you still somehow get ranked:
- No rank them 

If you somehow mess all of that up and still somehow get matched:
- Don't listen to CECA and take an 8 month ban from Waterloo Works (Really not recommended it ticks off the employer and CECA and it's unprofessional) 

You aren't gonna get penalized for taking an interview, you will if you don't make up your mind."
"The giant paragraph roughly means:

&amp;#x200B;

Last class, we (the girls) saved couple seats, and this man threw his bag onto one of the seats and jumped over the table to take that seat. He was saying the bad things including the ""F-word"" while we didn't say anything. We didn't want to escalate the situation so we chose to ignore him. Later when his friends arrived, he started flaming us again loudly. One of the girls said ""I feel offended"" to him, but he replied ""go back to china f\*\*\* I don't care your are offended, I am a Chinese but I was born in Canada. After class, we approached him to ask why he did this. We didn't use any offending words, we were really polite and wanted to ask him why. Before we even speak, he said ""come on, yell to me, it's not gonna do anything"". Then we said ""if you don't want to deal with this in a good way, we have no choice but seek help from the Dean"" He seemed scared a bit and said ""let's go outside and talk about this"". He then intentionally went to a corner near the bathroom to make others think we are abusing him. He said he can't promise that he won't abuse Chinese, he won't stop saying ""go back to China"", nothing can be promised. He said he was not in a good mood and only said ""sorry"". Then, the prof was walking by, he suddenly changed his attitude and apologized and said he won't do this again. We feel like he didn't really mean to apologize, to protect our right, we decided to report this incident to needle's hall. The adviser from needle's hall asked the prof what's the name of that student, the prof said didn't know. Today, the prof said if there's any conflict, go talk to him. We think his response is really vague, he didn't even talk about this incident (racist insulting). The man was smelling, after class we thought this already passed, but he jumped over a table and rushed to one of the girl (The girl didn't even talk to him last class) and then said ""yo watch out"". We feel like he is threatening us. Now it's close to midterm season, we are all really busy, we don't want anyone to hate CBC (Canada born Chinese) because of this. We just want the school to take this incident seriously. We don't want anyone experience this kind of incident while the school is already hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't mind my bad grammar :D"

I mean idk about anything, but I believe birds cannot taste capsaicin because peppers evolved to be eaten by birds to then have their seeds planted via excretion, so sure. I guess geese can survive ~~anything~~ 24 lines at lazeez"
"Eh it’ll explode but how big of an explosion you think it’s gonna be. It’s a small lithium ion battery.   So you can just cover it up with something clear, if your worried about shrapnel.  But you could do the fireworks thing I think that’d be pretty cool. "
"For some Engineering programs it's 70%, but others it's 80%, so double check which is yours. If it's a few points under they'll wiggle you in for a non-popular school. [Talk to Cindy Howe though for more advice.](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/about/people/cindy)"
"Got the email last week as well. The checkbox in the first part was left unchecked by my supervisor so asked her to fix it. Once I got it back (Tuesday), I asked the work report team to reopen my Dropbox, they replied to that email later that day and I resubmitted."
How are those fees spent? I'd be willing to bet they don't offset the costs externalized onto other taxpayers via increased enforcement requirements (ie ezra street) and waste removal costs in the spring when student tenants throw all of their garbage on the curb. 
"I got rejected for a job last week and the status changed to ""Interviews Complete"". Then today I got selected for the interview... any idea why this would happen? Why would a company interview people, then go back to people they already rejected and interview them?"
"I have reasons to cross the border, have dealt with street harassment locally, and an emboldened people would necessarily mean a greater risk of harm to me.

I also agree with you on the thermometers, they're good for sentiment in a very specific population though."
"I like to put my head on the table and close my eyes in lectures, sitting up only to jot down there new things on the board. 

In my head I'm thinking about whether the presented material makes sense and make logical connections from past material to new material. "
"I often get chest pain from fatigue and malnutrition. But seriously, go see a doctor and don't stop trying until someone takes you seriously and runs some tests. This could be serious and you should make sure it isn't before dismissing it as being all in your head."
"I think [this is on your level](https://youtu.be/Yc5OyXmHD0w), and I am certain we are on different wavelengths.

That means we can work together, we have different priorities in life, I will pay you beyond handsomely (23000 CHF monthly) if you can perform.  PM me."
"I thought it was pretty easy. As long as you know how to do the calculations that he mentions and make sure to do general review for the multiple choice questions :) I think the class avg for my year was pretty high: mid 70s or something, if that's any indication. "
"Would recommend stopping before season 5 tho, because it goes down teh shitter after that. jk, but it's still not great after S5. Also looking back in the amount of progress we have made in gender equality, some of it can look pretty harrass-y (imo like the office)"
"Yes, but bear spray is legal and it's practically the same thing. Also, a non negligible portion of the student population is already carrying knives/pepper spray. Even though Canadian self-defense laws are absolute shit, it's better in jail than in the morgue, no?"
"You can go to the community legal service to get some advice.

"heh yeah... it is up to the company to try and enforce the rules set out by the city... Could have told you that will be nest to impossible.

Wonder if they could do a GPS based 'kill switch' if you leave the ""rideable zone"" it makes you return or cuts power/speed."
"I fear that their software is no where near where it needs to be. If this has some killer apps for it it might last longer than a year or two. With only clunky software available this is a total niche product that will follow the same route as Myo.   


Was hoping it would be sold on amazon \[mega sales\], and maybe they would team up with some big software companies. But it seems they only have a messaging alert app and...?

&amp;#x200B;

For $1000 you could buy a complete VR system that actually serves a purpose. "
"One that I have learned is that with teamwork and perseverance, anything is possible. I was fortunately to have an engineering cohort class that was extremely co-operative. We very much had a ""we're all in this together"" mentality so everybody helped everyone out for notes, group studying, figuring out difficult problems together. High tides raise all ships.

Tough assignments and late nights are much less miserable when you have all your classmates around, cheering each other on and also complaining along with you."
"Please just Shut the fuck up you plebian. SHUT THE FUCK UP.

Any bimbo can flash their tits and manage grids in a some poor african country. I'll have you know that I have actually managed to intern in Menlo Park without being in 4A, while working on FaceBook NewsFeed with React.js. Imagine what someone like me could do with Waterloo's world leading mathematics and computer science education. 

All the other fobs who ""interned"" at Big 4 probably worked as a fucking janitor or something, like their immigrant parents."
"Pm me I'll answer any question related to men's health (euphemism for how to cum inside the hole of your choice), drugs, metaphysics, career trajectory, and how to convince drunk black teenagers with AK-47's to smile instead of shooting you in the face after you take a not-so-secret pic of him kissing his colleague after presumably not having been paid for 2 months.  Protip: it involves letting him know that YOU know that his boss cannot afford to put bullets in that rifle.  Everyone loves hitching about their boss."
"Yeah I agree that those views are harmful, but they probably don't see their views that way. If you attack their beliefs head on they'll just double down and get defensive. No one likes to think they're wrong, or hateful.

I know the situation sucks :( just try you best and don't beat yourself up if you can't change their minds!

Edit: I also like the not reacting and getting angry advice, although I don't think you should just give up (just don't put too much pressure on yourself or get your expectations too high)."
"Not as much as I'd like but I sometimes surprise myself and remember new words and phrases I thought I had forgotten. Fun course though I would recommend it! I love languages. I've taken Mandarin too, and I think I want to take french next term. I was raised in a French immersion system but haven't spoken at all over the past few years. 

You play violin too? Awesome! It's a super cool instrument but I find it really hard. We did play for their kids, they'd come to our concerts in olaf costumes and stuff it was pretty cool! 

You should play more! I know that when I used to sit outside and listen for a couple hours a night I didn't care if they were grandmasters or not I just liked to see people put effort into something! ��  Miss the outdoor pianos though ��"
"Posting from throwaway.

In my experience, nope, not at all. If you've seen a trend in the interns and their background, scores, specializations, and you don't match anything similar, you're 99% not going to break the trend. It's still possible, but not worth the time. I've made the same mistake with Jane Street, Citadel, other onsites. I passed phone interviews, but onsite is a different dynamic. It's a lot more about your fit (background/skill wise), and if you don't think you are 'fit' from looking at previous interns its a waste of time and you won't get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just my 2 cents, by all means if its your first onsite go for it, but in general you won't be breaking any trend so its important to look at the type of people hired and then compare yourself."
"So I essentially taught myself how to play. I say essentially because at the beginning, my mom helped a lot with guiding me through how to read sheet music, the basic scales and fingering (she attended a piano conservatory when she was younger so of course she would guide me). But from there, I was able to sight read very easily and didn’t need her help at all, unless I had a specific question. It’s all about practice - having exercise books helps. 
It was certainly possible for me to learn almost on my own - the internet can be your substitute for a piano playing mom haha! I don’t play great but for being self taught, I’d say I’m not bad. 
I should add that we already had a piano at home cause my brother took lessons. I also had a tonnnn of sheet music from my mom to choose from so I was lucky in that way. I realize finances can be an issue in that regard :/
And no you cannot learn without either a physical piano or keyboard. It’s literally impossible - you need to be able to move your hands across keys! "

"I think he fucked up, and I've pointed that out.

Social shaming doesn't work on men like it does on women; you need to explain to them why they've fucked up in a rational manner and hope they aren't too blind to see it.

I'm not interested in trying to salvage sluts anyway, they're pretty much irredeemable in the vast majority of cases. Guys seem to be able to recover from a few bad experiences without becoming complete nutcases obsessed with cats, feminism, or whatever other interest they pick up to replace their lack of children by around ~25.

It's likely a symptom of false pregnancy, a genuine medical condition that sexually active women who are on birth control can very often experience. The psychological aftermath of which is transference of the maternal instinct onto things other than children; in modern times this appears to be refugees, minorities, LGBT people etc.

If you attempt to ""hurt"" their ""babies"" they become that mama bear they should be to protect their children. But it's completely misguided now. 

Anyway, I have a genuine reason for disliking sluts and the culture that applies no shame to women who purposefully pursue such a lifestyle. It quite literally ruins the foundation of society (families) and turns women into demonic harpies.

As for the men participating in it, they are also a problem, of course. It takes two to tango. But thankfully it is a smaller pool of men having all the promiscuous sex, and somehow they don't appear to be personally damaged by it. They just leave a trail of destruction along the way. I dont think it makes sense to try to stop them, it's best to just raise our daughters properly and actually keep an eye on them, teach them what really happens when they behave this way - not that its empowering and liberating. Because it's really not, at all. The only people who benefit from it are those few men who are successful in the hookup culture game, but I have to wonder how their ""success"" really even feels when they go to bed alone with no prospects of passing on their lineage."

"&gt; I have deep emotional scars that have created issues with the way I act.

This is something you can work on though! Dealing with these scars and/or fixing the behavioural problems that result from the scars should be fixable even if it's hard and takes a while."
"&gt; they know you

Pretty sure 75% if my profs did not know me. And a medical condition could just mean a cold. If I'm out for a sick day at work I don't expect 100 people at my office to say get well soon. Maybe the 5-10 people I work with, but not more than that."
"Depends on how much money means to you vs everything else (friends, interesting work/company mission, culture, location (SF vs. Bay), etc.). 

Also depends on if the pay that you'd get is still competitive. I wouldn't go to Cali for &lt;= ~35/hour including housing."
"I actually read about it and even if they don’t want to pay, you can’t file for osap unless you’ve been working for x years full time or have been living apart from them for x time and other such circumstances. Unless I’m greatly misunderstanding something. "
I wish I took more electives (DD is limited but you can squeeze them in) or had gone on an exchange and worked more part-time jobs. I don't regret any extracurriculars in particular but I wish I was more focused. There was many times where I spread myself too thin. 
"Lol it is happening. I absolutely hate this attitude of, ""hehe wait for midterms to crush frosh ego"". It's terrible and everyone parrots it as some kind of sage advice. I literally see this everywhere, even high school teachers wouldn't stop talking about this lmao."
"No, and don’t get a refundable ticket. Those are likely to be 2x the cost.... Last winter term when they extended the exam period due to snow, those who had proof that they booked tickets earlier were able to either take the exam earlier or take it the next term. "
"Oh I see. Well having friends is ahead of a lot of people here. I mean it’s a counsellors job to make you comfortable and ask you questions, so you don’t have to worry about not knowing what to say. Also it’s confidential. Up to you. It’s helped some people."
Taken some pictures and recorded at least a bit of memories.  My time was in the early 80's before the dawn of cellphones and easy picture/vids.  I think this is likely true of a lot of undergrads from that time - we lack any photos of an important time in our life.
"The most efficient way is to straight up ask if he's interested in you. or ask him out on a date and be specific about making sure he understands it's a ""date"" and not just hanging out. Then take it from there. Although you need to first evaluate if he is worth it. "
"They are a resource for this. It's called a wellness check and it's part of their duty to uh you know serve and protect. Plus it's campus police,  what else do they have on their plate other than driving around ring road at all hours or waking up people in mc comfy?"

"You're minimizing the incidents. There's was much more to it than how you're portraying.

You keep leaving out Dave Mackay's sexual attack on Dr Winter that Dr Morgan witnessed and reported.

Why are you not talking about that?

Because it doesn't fit your argument?"
"Yup! The only thing that spending less on rent would give me is more money in savings, but I'm not breaking the bank by paying 800. Plus it is a nice luxury to be able to live alone haha. Once you do it once it's really hard to go back to living with other people :P"
eh if the rent is cheap then no harm in checking it out.  This is actually a pretty common thing these days.  In toronto there are people renting out their living rooms/dens in condos.  Hell the other week I saw an add for someone renting out a large walk in closet.

"Fair question! I'm the Secretary for Council, and I can confirm that we did quorum counts throughout at a few points. By the end, I am fairly sure we definitely lost quorum on the last few items, but there as no call for a quorum due to IT reasons (a lot of councillors are on co-op).

Thankfully we are getting a new skype-for-business tool to help with this (no more multiple google hangouts calls to do business).

We also had a lot of councillors leave in person (due to work) and call back in via the telecomm system."
"I mean you're really targeting mid-high end cars here. If you have the money, go for it, you'll love the performance of these cars. But if you're on a tight budget, you won't find an Acura/Lexus that's not too old, has too many km, or is just really beat up. But if you're going to insist on a sporty/stylish car on a budget, I think if you can find a Saab 9-3 in good condition with decent mileage then you're making a good choice regarding reliability, style, and performance. A Honda Accord would also be a good choice."
"If I'm reading this right, they lied about having lost the assignment when they really just gave it to their buddy to hand in. Lying to get around an academic requirement is pretty serious, in this case the requirement is stupid as fuck to be sure but you still shouldn't lie about this stuff.

EDIT: ""Student claimed personal issues prevented them from attending classes"" is why I think this is what the real problem was, they admitted that they didn't actually lose their paper copy they just didn't want to go to class."

L'Anglo me donne de l'argent et c'est tout, la culture ici n'existait jamais ou est mort sauf que les considérations économiques des consommateurs et peut être des fois ils ce concernent des homosexuels ... tabarnak."
"how is HKU = mcmaster?? 

* HKU = UT/McGill. HKU trumps CUHK and HKUST for pretty much everything collectively
* CUHK = UBC
* HKUST = UW, top tier business school in asia (equivalent to Ivey), HKUST engineering &gt; HKU engineering
* PolyU = ryerson/ mac for their health related programs, best design school in HK 
* CityU is known as ShittyU in HK for a reason... maybe laurier??

OP you should try to look at HKU if u want time to explore the city. It is really close to the heart of HK since HKUST is kinda a bit far from the city, need to bus to the nearest MTR station which may take like half an hour, but has a sea and fresh air I guess. CUHK is also really far and isolated, need to take the school bus (it's on a hill), the most convenient place to stay would be HKU. "

Exactly, so lets drop the pretense and stop using the government to try to help people in any way. Force people to form small communities for interdependence if they want to survive. I'm all for individualism buts its gone too far. "
"82% in English, 95.5% average, I wasn't concerned. My thought process was, and still is, that your English mark doesn't matter as long as everything else is around 100%. My school also rarely handed out anything higher than 80s for English, the average is around 70%."
Canadian grading is different from US. They are often curved to a 4.0 (generally 90-100%). An 80 is roughly a 3.7 gpa using medical school conversion standards. Your raw grade can not be compared at all. One easy way to benchmark is usually Dean's list requirements. 
"I get the same reaction when I use the outlets that says “Razors only” for the Electric razor that I carry in my backpack to shave my pubes into the sink... I don’t get it, like there’s a label on the outlet telling me that’s what it’s for and everything!"
"I got sub 70 in 9/10/11 English. Pulled it together first term (non semestered school) for an 88 during applications, dropped to 80 final mark. I think without without that 88 I wouldn't have made it in, but if you can boost it up to around that point you'll be fine."

"McMaster engineering is shit. Ryerson engineering is even shittier.

Waterloo and UofT have the best engineering programs so come to Waterloo or go to UofT to study real engineering.

"Unfortunately I haven't played other AC games other than Origins, which I didn't finish because Odyssey just came out and it looked to be even better. I was an MMORPG player for the longest time so Odyssey seems to be more geared towards my play style.

I do remember watching my friend play one of the very first AC games on Xbox though, it was probably AC 1 or 2. I wanted to play but I was too poor and addicted to WoW at the time lmao

I'll go back and finish Origins later though. I was pretty close to the end anyway."
"Firstly, ""Asian culture"" doesn't exist because Asia is too large to be homogeneous in culture - so if someone is saying they want to date someone with ""Asian culture"" that's pretty racist in itself because they're doing the whole ""all Asians are the same to me"" thing. 

But anyways, let's replace ""Asian culture"" with some specific cultural aspect of being Asian, for example, say, being able to speak Taiwanese Mandarin or something. The former doesn't include every Asian, or even every person from Taiwan, as they might have moved to, like Canada or USA when they were young and know nothing about where their parents grew up. As well, there are loads of ethnic Asians with brown hair and pink undertoned skin so that excludes some more people. Conversely, someone doesn't need to be ethnically from Asia to satisfy those traits - loads of Eastern Europeans (and other ethnicities too) have super yellow undertoned skin and black hair, and if one of them moved to Taiwan when they were small they can probably speak their dialect. "
"You've completely missed the context in which this statement was made.

&gt;push for the advancement of this life style

This is the clause I have an issue with. On a post about parents who are openly homophobic, saying we shouldn't push for the advancement of LGBT rights in a direct reply is ostensibly a defence of that homophobia. I would have no problem if the comment said ""OPs parents might come from a society where having a marriage and children is extremely important, and so accepting or even tolerating a group of people who have obvious barriers to procreation seems illogical."" But, it obviously was not that. Do you see how the phrasing of the sentence completely changed its meaning?

As for your second point, I completely agree that gay people have fewer children than straight people. This much is obvious. But gay people can still adopt or use donor sperm/eggs, meaning that sexual orientation is absolutely not a causal factor in not having kids, and the percentage of gay couples with children is rising rapidly. If you have any semblance of social skills, there is absolutely a way to phrase the truth in a way that is respectful, and phrasing is ESPECIALLY important to make sure you don't obfuscate the intended semantics of your statement by introducing  ambiguity."
"&gt;As the 17th fast approaches...  
&gt;  
&gt;In just one week a new era will begin. Now I know some of you could care less. Some of you may even be opposed to this change. However, this post is not directed to those people. This post is directed to the people like me, those who cannot wait for their passion to become legitimate.

&gt;  
&gt;Now, I could go off on a rant about how cannabis was only made illegal to persecute minorities. Or about how the reason it stayed illegal was to benefit big pharmaceutical companies. Or about how you have been lied to about its effects. Or about how marijuana will eventually be legal in most of the world.  Or about how the war on drugs is a miserable failure. But I think I’ll refrain from that and move on to what I really want to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I propose a meetup for all the jazz cabbage fanatics. You read that right. Now that we can finally enjoy what we love, why shouldn’t we? So, why don’t we meet up and celebrate together. Now I am aware that most people have lives that don’t allow them to get high every day. With that considered, I am setting the event date for Friday October 19th.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s meet up next to Columbia lake next Friday and celebrate. All are welcome.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re interested, shoot me a PM and if there’s enough interest, we can set up some sort of group chat. I have a few friends who will probably be down, but the more people the better.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh, and if you’ve gotten to this point and think I’m joking, you’re wrong. This is not some kind of bullshit bait post. This is real. Don’t believe me, then just swing by Columbia lake next Friday ;)

Some people in r/uwaterloo seem pretty excited about it."

"Yes it’s safe to drink even with the minerals. Some of the minerals might actually be good for you. You’ll get used to the taste as well if it’s not filtered but it takes some time.

"Hi, I’m in the Amath/Scientific computation major. The best way to judge a plan is by seeing the courses that are required for it. The goal of Amath/Scientific computation is to learn how to use computers to solve problems in math and science. One important research area is solving differential equations using computers. Amath gives you a theoretical treatment of DEs and the cs courses teach you computational methods of solving DEs. There are no required first year courses other than the general math and cs courses.

Then if the non-whites come after us they'll have to admit that either (1) They're here to conquer us and take everything we build both in the past, now, and until we cease to exist or (2) They like being around us in which case they should do things our way. "
"The employee was initially named in the anonymous public submission before it was redacted, I have no idea what university policy or courts would have to say about that. 

And exactly how does one ""walk like a Chinese girl""? I've never heard that one before, do you walk in a really subdued way or something? 

Although it is ridiculous that they aren't telling you exactly what you're being accused of. You should absolutely be given the chance to defend yourself and a reasonable amount of time to put together a defense. "
"This class is always packed. So dont save seats if u r seating at the front of the classroom imo. Let the people who gets there first get the privilege to be at the front. Plus the dude is definitely trolling yall. Why is ur sense of pride for ur country/race so fragile that you care about some random dick flappin his mouth and feel the need to gang up to confront him after class in a group of six lmao


Theres both sides to the story to consider but at the end of the day he aint gonna do shit if he wants to stay in UW"
"This happened to me once at work. 

I worked with 3 other coops all in engineering. 

One day, we were joking around and one of the co worker said he could solve anything in the world because he’s super smart. 

I asked him what 7 * pi was and he said 22, and i proceeded  by calling him a dumbass. 

2 other coworkers joined in and i told them what he said and they agreed with him. 

All three of them started laughing their ass off and started calling me a dumbass and i tried to explain that 7*pi does not equal 22. 

"
"Good to hear ��true ah I usually find it notably easier to learn the writing over the speaking too

whoo that enthusiasm�� 9 years of immersion though, it'll probably come back to you relatively smoothly, would you be looking at a course for it too (si oui which one)��

Hah nope too early for me then�� we shall see 

French was from school, took it from elementary school through gr12 and still am rn kinda, ukr was technically my first lang but got trampled by english by age 5-7 and lessened w each year afterwards sadly�� can understand and read decently ish but speaking is poor. One course each *so far* eh�� Is the first step, could definitely nurture those interests and develop the russian or mandarin further now that you've gotten intro tastes "
"I agree, but some things thing that I find really frustrating about some CS assignments is that they can be repetitive, tedious (like cs 348 assignments), contrived, take up too much time and/or are based off of lots of hard material that is not taught in class (I'm looking at you CS 458 A1). I personally dislike any assignment that includes these factors, and tbh I don't think it's really conducive to learning.

If I were you, I'd focus on making an assignment that tries to exclude all factors that would make an assignment bad or counterproductive to learning, and then maybe make small tweaks to improve it even further. 

PS: I really enjoyed the CS 350 assignments and your lectures were very informative/fun. Hope you aren't planning on changing the os assignments haha"
"So not only are you mis-informed about municipal issues, you also don't know how construction projects operate. The lrt is only 6% over budget (868 vs 818m), mostly due to unanticipated utility relocates and delays caused by the corduroy road. Additionally, half of that $50m overage is being covered by the province, so your ""significant"" overage is 3% of budget. 

And tritag's study is more academic and reliable than yours. If people want completely anecdotal evidence to convince them that the lack of snow removal is a problem; find a senior living in the downtown core and watch them try to get anywhere on the sidewalk. 

If morons hiding behind conservatism weren't so fucking dumb, people might engage you in civil discourse. Until then keep fucking yourself in the ear."

"/u/koolaid1800 I hope you get excited for this AGM because there are some items that will actually be very useful changes to better the direction of the corporation, increase accountability to members, and help improve the use of student fees. 

Keep your eyes peeled! "
But everyone's got some kind of issues and as far as issues go being jealous sometimes isn't nearly as unmanageable as other things that can happen so there's no need to worry OP. (Unless its impacting other areas of life but the OP didn't sound like that was the case)
"Fuck yeah. It is more than just about graduating with a degree for me. It has greatly tied into to my mental health journey, so completing this degree after all that garbage I had to wade through, of course I'm gonna celebrate and that includes doing all the bullshit. "
"Hongkong is better choice for a English speaker, u don't have to  speak Cantonese or Mandarin there cuz most people also speak English.

btw I believe all host universities in japan require ur japanese should be arriving at N1 level, or you can't be exchanged to there "
"I mean, there is very little they can do to help with this. Many, many people experience digestive problems with anxiety and it's super ""shitty"" but they'll just probably ask you to eat something different before or drink coffee in the morning to help you poop before! "
"I rEcIeVeD aN oFfEr FrOm DeLoItTe


I hope this is an actual question and not just a boast post to make others feel bad. If it's the first, you should really be emailing the HR coordinator the question. AFAIK, Deloitte doesn't usually offer help with relocation though."
"Idk about that some people I talk to geniunely don't understand what it's like (at least they don't seem like they do). Some people also think sad = depressed.

I'm sure a lot of people have felt depressed though, if not for a long time, then for at least a day or two."
"If you really are Dr Wallace, just wanted to say that I really appreciate how fast you reply on Piazza and all together you're a really cool prof. 

I think the way you teach/answer questions shows that you actually care about your students success. Thank you for that!"
"None of us actually know what the ban is. The universities have to submit their policies for free speech. What is actually banned will be apparent once Doug Ford gets his hands on these policies. 

The ban will be a reflection of what Doug Ford believes is free speech."
Not unless you're lying about your income. Loans are available to anyone as they understand that some students have rich parents but those parents don't always help their kids. The only difference is if you have lower income you get a lot more grants rather than loans.
"The ping is just the ping to the toronto server for the speedtest. It's not the ping you get in game. But sub 2 down is kind of ridiculous and leads to packet loss which is far worse than ping.

"A TA that says that to any student should be shot and is probably an egotistical power tripper so just ignore them.

I see you have both offers from at TA for tutoring (its not a conflict btw if they are just tutoring) and from fellow students to work together.

This is one of the strange things about many stem subjects - every student works as an army of one.  Sometimes you need to band together to work things out.

And there is a formal tutoring system available at the university - strongly suggest you check it out.  "
"Check pages 93-97 of this master plan from 2009. Some of it has already been built, but this is the rough path forward for the east campus. I suspect building #17 will be built as E8 on the paved lot north of E5/7.

https://uwaterloo.ca/plant-operations/sites/ca.plant-operations/files/uploads/files/2009_campus_master_plan.pdf

Something this plan didn't account for was all of the Blackberry land (EC1-5). Engineering has a decent amount of office space over there that has taken some of the pressure off of new buildings.
"
"Depends on their personality normally I guess. 

If they don't talk to people much generally cuz they're shy and introverted it's kinda weird? But that doesn't necessarily mean there's any kind of feelings going on they might just be trying to make a new friend.

If they always have group chats going on and talk to everyone alot normally then it's probably w/e. 

Just talk to them and ask what's going on cause there are too many variables in situations like this for people from the internet to really give a good answer."
"I see your point. If we assume your assertions are true, wouldn't that actually prove we harshly and callously criticize Chinese international students (or any foreign group of people who we deem alien from the local population) more unjustly compared to local Canadians? Because like you said, these actions aren't inherently Chinese and are committed by everyone if we extrapolate the data but the Chinese international students are the ones who are criticized more heavily for it because they aren't locals. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"Part of the problem is there was substantial confusion about the new bylaw requirement (See Article 11.1(6)) that each acclamation needs a yes/no vote.

Since it's not quite an acclamation anymore, now an election, Feds procedure requires that vote to take place with nomination periods and what not... which now makes it competitive again, maybe? ... anyways the entire process is a mess now because this bylaw change was irresponsibly included without forethought. 

The bylaw amendment is being recommended to be moved into procedure at the GM which will clarify this in the future, but for now it's still a hot potato.

As I understand it the by-election will be held soon and the candidates in question have both been invited to the Council meeting this Sunday by the Speaker!"

"From what I saw, the university didn't delve into that themselves. They should just do whatever promotional stuff they would do for any other Nobel prize winner. And I would assume that they'll smack her picture on some recruitment posters for physics related programs. "
"I actually like National Post a lot. I normally read NP, Toronto Star, and CBC for my local news.

Despite it being more conservative than I consider myself to be, I find that their op-eds are usually better written than TS's or CBC's. I like Chris Selley in particular."
"I love the implication that the Nobel committee giving a physics prize to a woman for the third time ever, and the first time in many decades is some kind of affirmative action.

""Clearly there's a pattern here, no way three women have earned the award over 100+ years!"""
"I think what keeps me going and respecting myself is having an end goal, or atleast something I'm working towards. Understanding that some day I'll be successfully because of all the work I put in, and actually putting in work to get to my goals keeps me generally happy"
"If it makes you sleep better to think no one cares, good luck with that.

We're talking about our campus safety, our UW Counselling Services, our UW mental health services. A lot of us care.

For someone who doesn't care, you gave a strong negative emotion to 2018. Why?"
If ur so sure u are discriminated against then Surely you can find another one? It must be easy to find right? Almost as easy as the ridiculous amount of posts you have talking about how much of a literal **fuck up** you are at interviews and coding and life in general 
Make sure you let them know you want nothing serious. I hate when guys go on a date with me and then expect me to sleep with them even after I tell them no hookups. They're only wasting their own time though cause I improve my terrible social skills with each date lmao.
"Really a prof would actually expect a get well email? If I was a prof I wouldn't want my inbox being spammed by 100 emails all saying the same thing. People get enough emails as it is, and it's not like most students will have a personal relationship with the professor."
"Really hope those lime scooter things don't get past the pilot project... They are too slow for bike lanes, and too fast for sidewalks. Nothing more annoying than having to bike around a scooter, or having electric scooters trying to weave around people on the sidewalk."
"Unfortunately your IQ can't be changed. Maybe if you do lots of brain teasing puzzles, it'll go up by a point or two.

I'd also recommend not being so tall, it's intimidating. Perhaps chop off your feet. If you're still too tall, cut your legs off right below the knees."

"&gt;never locked the door

Sounds like every roommate I ever had in Waterloo. I seriously don't understand it. I seriously wonder if they have the same habit when they go home? 

Anyways, what I did was that I posted an article of people entering units like [this](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/waterloo-university-ave-break-ins-drunk-pretend-1.4069209) as well as a very rude message by the door knob telling them that this is why you fucking lock the doors. It has somewhat worked for me. Maybe try this?"
"There's literally nothing wrong with the 14 words. Replace ""white"" with any other ethnicity or race and you'd think nothing of it. Faith even did a video to prove this point. She replaced white with native and hundreds of people signed her document in support. 

The problem is that you are too emotional and see meaning, dog whistling and MUH NAZIS where there isn't any need for it. 

My point with CNN and FOX is that they actually cause hatred and never solve anything. Faith's speeches could actually resolve some issues."
"\&gt; I would never sacrifice my mental well-being and general happiness

Suppose you didn't make this sacrifice. Speaking from personal experience, you incur additional stress (compared to someone in my position) in the form of:

1. Not being prepared for interviews of a company you wanted
2. Not getting job interviews
3. Not finding a job (entering continuous) when your friends are bragging about whatever jobs they got
4. Not being motivated from your job

While you incur additional mental strain from the leetcode / side project activities I've described, it also forces you to conserve mental energy at your co-op job. ie: slack off a little more at work. It's very typical to overestimate the expectations that managers have of you.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I wouldn't say that I was any more stressed / less happy than a my friends working at a startup putting in 60 hr/week. I'll leave it up to the reader to make the tradeoff for themselves.'

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I hope the grind was worth it :)

Will find out next term :) "
"&gt;Actually believing that Scheer has the spine to face to confront the hysterical pro-choice lobby

Bruh, PCs have never had the spine to force those conversations what made you think anything was going to change? You need to have the balls to deal with people physically and virtually assaulting you and your family to force that conversation. The last PC to be slandered (Patrick Brown) crumpled like a piece of paper the instant that mob came after him (and he was basically a Liberal). They go into full meltdown whenever anyone even thinks about questioning their social movements and they have the backing of the courts and media. We need an outsider visionary with balls of steel to go down that route. 

&gt;supply management

I think Bernier needs to stop talking about this so much, because most people don't really care although people do care about the hormone thing. He's clearly butt hurt that he lost because of the dairy farmers mobilizing and he should just let it go. 

&gt;seemed neutral about social issues

And this is a huge problem, they have plenty of opportunities to bring forward a conservative approach to various issues even if it was just publicly encouraging parents to talk to their children about things. Instead they spinelessly repeal things because none of these old dudes ever grew the spine to confront their hippie counterparts. They should also start talking more directly to their base kind of like Trump (but maybe a little more intellectually) because we cannot trust the media not distort their message. "

"strongly disagree, the school's **main** goal isn't to help **you** find jobs, you need to go job hunting yourself if you want the good ones, as far as school's concerned you can be working minimum pay at McD flipping burgers and they'll still consider you employed

"Arts is statistically a lower paying, lower job prospects degree. Then theres also the whole Arts is easy, or arts students just like to party connotation, which obviously is  a stereotype but even stereotypes have some truth. Personally I love arts courses and I think they have more intrinsic value than any other program. Unfortunately that doesn't always translate into the non-academic world. I wouldn't take offence because at the end of the day, we should all do what we love. Some people just have different priorities."
"I know it's super cliche but I'm kinda interested in the change of humans being nomadic to them creating civilizations as a result of (I think?) The agricultural revolution.

"I appreciate the diplomatic and solution based way that you presented your opinion.  THank you, you're probably right.  

How many hours of 'grinding leetcode' do you think is sufficient, not to actually solve the leetcode problems, but to have an idea of how much time is required by a skilled individual to solve them?  The meta-solution, how many hours of looking at the problem do you think it takes to have an idea of how long a person skilled at that problem would need to solve the problem?

It's actually a difficult question, my dear.  Eintsein was a patent clerk in Switzerland and then came up with general relativity.  how would one begin to estimate that work involved or possibility of solution or even recognition of that problem?  

I am open to your insight, please."

"&gt; alcohol v weed

Alcohol doesn't leave residual traces in your body for up to 30 days, and it doesn't lead to the same mindset changes that weed does.

Every group of people has their opium of the masses. People are ""freaking out"" because having weed as the socially acceptable drug means that we'll have far more (noticed) depression and anxiety, instead of people mindlessly forgetting their problems with hedonism. That's a scary reality for those who have been escapists for years or decades.

&gt; You're free to not drink or to not smoke weed, but it doesn't mean you should expect others to not because YOU FEEL that it is so terrible.

Nothing to do with my personal feelings. It ruins people's lives, period. Not everyone's who touches it, but it's often young people smoking it. And studies clearly show that underdeveloped (&lt;25 y.o) brains are most affected by marijuana, including long-term effects.

&gt; I smoke weed during the evenings to sleep as I struggle with severe PTSD. Unless I've told someone, people have NO IDEA. Since you believe SO much in personal experience, I can tell you that in my personal experience, my life has not changed since I started, besides a little better sleep and a bit more of an appetite for an hour or so.

Is it curing your PTSD or simply applying a bandaid and delaying the inevitable? Are you a war veteran or something? 

I've heard of people using weed for anxiety. Really doesn't make any fucking sense since it just makes you more anxious from the dopamine dumps and subsequent burnout. "

"Actually, it’s been going down, as last year CECA split co-op salaries between Canada and the US, resulting in the average Canadian wage being significantly lower (especially for 4th year). On the other hand, at least it makes it clear why the brain drain’s happening."
"All the reviews seem to be from salty first years expecting that 90% in high school should mean 90% in university. I'm not saying that she isn't a bad lecturer (though I've heard only good things about her for upper year E&amp;M), but these reviews seem kind of misplaced."
By a lot. Ever notice that we don’t have recycling or garbage bins on major streets? And we haven’t invested in any renewable energy centred infrastructure as a Region. Finally green bin pickup in apartments would divert tonnes of compostable waste from the landfill. 
"I wouldn't say 10x but I found 2A (CS 246, CS 245, STAT 230, MATH 239) to be the hardest of the 5 standard terms. 2B (CS 241, CS251, CS 240, STAT 231) to be somewhat easier (though I slacked off in 240).

People say 3A is hard, but legit I thought it was the easiest term."
"I'm working on just that my dude. 

It takes a lot of money to start such a project. 

It'd be great if it happened organically but it really can't in modern cities, especially when everyone is so drastically different and their ""communities"" are basically online bubbles."
"Idk, most live in kitchner. Plus it was never my intention to brag. This isnt even that much money, my friends in dubai go quadruple digits beyond the 100k so idk why you think im bragging, there is nothing to brag about. 
What i really like to brag about is my 6.2 inches"
"If you have a good speaker, then I suspect there won't be much difference. This one does fill up the entire room with white noise and can block \~95% of the outside noise. With earplugs and this, I didn't hear a single beat from shitty EDMs that my roommates were playing."
It's totally possible. Fuck upper years who tell you that you're going to do badly; it's the opposite of what they should be saying. You are absolutely capable of getting 90s in university. Don't be content with mediocrity just because some upper years said you should be.
"No idea why. I just read it here:
 http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Examinations-and-Promotions-Rules

If you read under number 2, it says that any grade below 32 is interpreted as a 32. Now I just need someone to confirm that this is true for all Eng programs.

"When you were a student trustee for the DSBN were you in university or high school? What were your attendance numbers like? I admire what you're doing here, but I have trouble believing you'll have enough time to do a satisfactory job while also being a full-time student."
"You didn’t read what I wrote at all if you think I was at all saying guys are entirely responsible. I have explicitly stated that both parties are responsible. Please read before constructing an argument and calling me naive and demonstrating your ignorance, thank you. "
"Depends on which high school you go to, but for my school the high 90s kids didn't go to Waterloo, and the math/eng kids usually got in with &lt;= 95. You definitely don't have to be that smart to get low 90s - imo only English is deflated in comparison to Ontario, so you can easily get mid-high 90s in your other courses. If you go to a top high school in Alberta, your uni average probably will be within 10% of hs unless you give up on school.

Also Alberta may be getting inflated as well as it used to be 4% boost for UBC."
"Grad schools quite often will look at the average over the last two years instead of cumulative (whichever is higher). So she so could be okay. 

The fact that she wrote the midterm, I doubt she will be able to file a grievance. And even then she shouldn't claim to have had a migraine unless that was actually the case but it sounds more like she was just having a bad time because of your conversation. I know you said she also had a migraine but if that's the case she should have just got a vif and not written the midterm. "
He really screwed everyone over in the chem 220 course he's teaching by having a one question multiple choice quiz worth 10% of your final grade. The options were super vague and 3/4 were possibly correct answers. People were allowed to keep their laptops and mobile phones because it was a quiz on learn but this simply lead to mass-cheating. He also does not do problems in lectures neither does he explain formulae and instead goes on 20-30 minute rants leaving most of the teaching of the content to the TA in the tutorials.
"SE is more structured. Good if you're not sure what you want to do or have trouble making friends and motivating yourself entirely on your own. Most people are in this category. Probably much better for networking too.

CS is more flexible. Probably good if you hate all the SE required classes or want to do unconventional things. You can take more electives, modify your schedule pretty much however you  want, drop coop if you don't want it anymore, take terms off, take courses whenever you want, etc.

that's pretty much it"
"There was nothin to study! He only rambles in class and basically our only content for the course is going to the tutorial where our TA does problems.  But it’s not even someone who knows the course.  She’s an MNS grad student who said to us explicitly that she’s not fully aware of everything that’s going on in the course 

And it’s not like that question was something you can study for either, not like the problems the TA did or the homework set that he gave us to study for.  That question is fully subjective.  "
"YEah i mean if you were super unlucky with the genetic lottery then you're uh kinda fucked no matter what but that probably applies to liek 1% of the population or something

But even if you were socialized really badly; behaviors can be unlearnt thru hard work and i firmly believe everyone else can learn how to be attractive and work towards being like a 7-8/10. Above that and you're gunna need to be lucky with genetics too but like a 7-8 is good enough for most things unless you want to be a model or actor or something. "
"&gt;My co-workers ask me if I seen x movie or heard of y person. I always say I don't know because I actually don't know. No, I haven't seen starwars, lord of the rings, avengers, the matrix, or any of those. 

Dude, you're almost the same as one of my coworkers, except she has at least watched and read Harry Potter. I ask her what she's done instead and she said K-dramas and Nintendo Switch.

&gt;What do I do reddit? I don't want to appear as stupid/sheltered/ignorant to my co-workers.

Unfortunately, unless you start following popular shows/movies/people/memes, etc, you're doomed on this front."
"It's really not that hard. There was this one guy I took an instant dislike to during the group interview after he singled me out in a negative manner, and I oozed passive distaste for the rest of the group interview and the single interview. For example, if he's a contractor start talking about how much you enjoyed inspecting and catching contractors cutting corners. If he's a public employee, insinuate a deep dislike for the public sector by suggesting you want a go-go-go environment and that you hate sitting around. Don't ask them any questions when they ask you if you have any questions, etc, etc. 

My interview was over in 5 minutes so my method really works well. 

Disclaimer: If you think you might work them in the future, I less obvious method may be a better idea. "
"&gt; Completely missed the point of my argument. Canada has barely any effect on climate change, other than our nice big forests. So it's just virtue signaling. Nothing is actually changing.

Like the other poster said, you're now using the nirvana fallacy to say theres no point in Canada doing shit because we alone can't combat climate change (which may or may not exist according to you).

And alleging any measure of being a ploy to virtue-signal is just the refuge of person who needs cover for their adolescent lack of emotional growth due to having no moral compass.

You're also strawmanning the shit out of me by thinking I dote over Trudeau and don't have legitimate issues with him. So characteristic of  people who make up caricatures of ""the left"" as though its some type of monolith. The fact that you call the OLP leftist is evidence enough that your overton window is too far on the right. I take it you consider the NDP communists? lol

Your entire worldview is full of logical fallacies and bad faith interpretations.

Also, it was with McMaster and not UW but still all the same. Numerous peers bore witness to the original issue and submitted anonymous letters (which the Chair refused to view). Anonymous due to the fact that everyone wanted to GTFO ASAP with their degrees in hand. I went from winning Academic Excellence awards x 2 years to being deemed 'incompetent' by a tutor and not being given a chance to prove myself otherwise to anyone else.

I fought and fought, printing every policy I could find, reading, highlighting, referencing, etc. but eventually, once summer came and I was out of that toxic environment, I broke down and stopped fighting.

I too kept detailed logs, CC'd emails, recorded conversations, had on campus and off campus counselling related to the issue(s) at hand. I know I should have gone to the Omsbudsman but I lost all faith in the system and myself.

All this to say, kudos for fighting and for making it through OP.

Now if only they were held a little more accountable...or even at all really..."

At one point it was because the spacing from the platform to the trains was misjudged by construction workers.

Short short term goals though: study efficiently for too-close midterms, actually break up essay writing into manageable chunks rather than leaving them for the days they're due, and ofc the constant 'stay balanced' (class, assignments, friends and family, hobbies, sleep, etc) �� What about you (esp w this being your last year)?"
"**Belegarth Medieval Combat Society**

Belegarth Medieval Combat Society is a full contact battle game where foam weapons are used in order to prevent serious physical injury to participants. It differs from other battle games and LARPs in that it is entirely combat-oriented that allows hard hitting, shield bashes, and grappling with little emphasis on role playing and has no magic or character classes. It is composed of a number of not-for-profit ""realms"", which compete at regional and national events every year. Typically, each realm also holds individual fighting practices several times a week.

"Honestly, I’ve found variations among my friends. Most people I know don’t seem to have an issue (either that or they keep quiet). When people do vocalize something offensive/passive aggressive I usually attribute it to closed-mindedness. No one has perfect manners. I know I’ve messed up culturally when travelling, and I think it’s just important to be kind and understanding to others when they don’t get every single cultural etiquette nuance correct (because reality is, most people don’t, regardless of where they’re from). 

However, when friends do say something that’s a little dicey, I always call them out in a polite way: ie. “I know you probably meant to be funny/sarcastic/whatever, but that person might not know about xyz and would likely be upset if they overheard that” I don’t care if it’s daunting to be “that friend” sometimes I just can’t keep quiet on issues that affect other people in my social circles.

Policing international students on “how to act” although well-intended, I don’t think is a great approach. Adopting habits takes time, and acknowledging every faux-pas can seem overbearing and really just creates a more negative situation imo. The only time I’ll mention it, is if someone from another country takes the initiative to ask about certain habits/customs. In that case, I’m happy to explain, but otherwise, I try not to intentionally look for ways to correct others. I’d just be going into an interaction looking for flaws, which doesn’t seem fair to the other party."

PMATH 333 is supposed to bring regular ppl up to speed with ppl who took the advanced courses.

"
Friend of mine in I think... 4A? CS now has been taking four courses a term since second year. It may take you a bit longer to graduate but there’s nothing wrong with that. From how he made it sound it’s actually not that out of the ordinary to take four courses a term.

Not necessarily. I don't think my brother gets overtime until past 50 or 55 hours because he's in construction. Most labor laws only really apply to the public sector.

Ask them what they expect, usually ""minimum"" is what everybody does and going past that will get you better reviews and potentially put you on track for promotions. Most professional businesses use the carrot to get people to work past the minimum, they're usually a lot less willing to risk using the legally dicey stick.  "
"Actually, Latin is NOT the precursor to germanic languages. it's the precursor to languages like French, Italian, Spanish and Romanian. (Tho Romanian is heavily influenced by slavic languages) 

&amp;#x200B;

However both English and German absorbed a lot of vocabs from Latin. And to a larger extent, they are both on the European side of Indo-Europian language family.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally know a German girl who took Latin in high school and is thus able to understand all of French, Italian, and Spanish to some extent."
"Chuck was indeed the manager of Fed Hall. I played a lot of pool with Chuck and his moustache. I believe the Columbia Lake Townhouses we built during my time (89-95). We still walked through that creeping f'ing cornfield, past the campus radio station, to get north.

And I knew exactly one girl from one of the colleges during my stay, she was studying engineering. I remember two things: 1. They had all these curfews and rules about boys being in the buildings, etc. and 2. All those rules didn't seem to slow down Brenda much!"
"I think our school's academic rigor plays a big part in the academic advising score being low too. My theory is that if more students are getting good grades then there's less of a chance that they would need to see their academic advisor. However, when a lot of people are getting bad marks or failing courses, this can lead to greater demand to see academic advisors and can lead to frustrations related to dropping out or switching programs. On another note, we beat UofT in student satisfaction overall so that's a good start."
"Not exactly sure at what level of government holidays work (province and federal likely?) but could the city or region try to make voting day a holiday or make it online? 

Small steps like that go a long way! If ~~students~~ voters could vote from their phone it would go very far to fixing the problem. I mean every Canadian has multiple unique identifiers, and while Health and SIN cannot be used for ID purposes (I think?) there mechanisms we could institute to verify the voter based on ID, street address, etc. could we not?"
"This is generally how they work: the student solutions will have the even or odds questions and the instructor's manual has the other. The instructor gives out the questions that aren't in the student solutions as assignments (theoretically the students don't have the answers) but the students likely still have access to the instructor's manual and just copy the solutions.

Using the student solutions manual to learn how to do it is fine, that's what it's for, you just can't copy the solutions from the instructor's manual.

"
"You can try to use Anki, a free program where you make flashcards and then quiz yourself ... much more conscious involvement than just looking at notes. You can rank your flashcards by difficulty too, so your most challenging cards will show up the most often. If there's a question that I'm really struggling with then I will write out the answer on a piece of paper (rather than just repeating the answer in my head).   


I just don't think that any time spent using Anki is time spent badly since you're kinda forced to learn?"
"It feels quite validating to see others go through problems that echo my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate that you've had to go through this, the system as a whole needs a lot of change, and it is rather unfortunate that people don't realize it until they've been screwed by it.

&amp;#x200B;

Back a few years ago, I was denied the service I needed by Counselling Services. I had to fight for months while wanting to end my life just to be able to get any semblance of help, and it turns out they didn't want to help because I was too extreme a case for them to be helpful with, so they left me for dead.

&amp;#x200B;

They've made a lot of changes, but they still would rather let people jump out the fifth floor of Beck Hall than address root causes and help everyone who needs it."
"nah they respect me, they always say ""oh wow u so smart"", which I imagine means ""wow you're smart for a white guy"" since Canadians don't work very hard and aren't typically so mathematically inclined. 

They just stick to themselves and speak mandarin, which I don't blame them for at all. I do the same thing anyway, but with other Canadian or Eastern European students.

The ways in which they're rude are not really in personal conversation or anything. They're just oblivious to a lot of things that Canadians consider important which makes sense since they're foreign but it's still very annoying, and they really don't seem to treat the faculty very well. They'll cheat on an entire course and then blame the prof, try to get the prof and TAs in trouble with the admins, for example. 

It's like they're kind of nice until you spend enough time around them and realize they'd backstab you for another 5% on their grade.

I realize they're like this because their parents push them so hard, but it doesn't mean I enjoy being around them."
"&gt; so it was easier

Ya that wouldnt really fly for admissions. Its best for any competitive program like eng to take the required core courses within the school term. Also Summer school english isnt always easier, you have an essay due just about every week as opposed to like once or twice a month in day school.

Volunteering specifically doesnt mean much. You need your 40 hrs to graduate ontario highschool and thats that. For uni what they care about is the actual time dedication and quality of EC, this expands beyond volunteering. For soft eng and cs this would especially mean side projects and technical competitions. The quality matters in terms of the result or purpose of each activity was, along with diversity of activities such as volunteering + clubs + sports + other ecs and competitions. Thats the well-roundness they like to see. Plus consistency: did you only write one math comp in grade 12 for the sake of having on the aif or did you write 2-3 over the course of highschool? Did you only do football for grade 9 and 10 and drop it when grades mattered more in grade 11-12? Its hard to trick admissions into thinking youve done a lot if you try to jam it all in with things you did briefly in the last 2 years of highschool with only a couple hours of dedication per week "

"A thrift shop and a sweat shop are probably polar opposites on a scale of morality.

I know what I'm talking about. I know the working conditions, and I know the corruption of the oil oligarchy. I'm not mad at your dad, so chill. He's just a smart man fulfilling the demand. "
"Both smh. The sooner you treat your coworkers as equals and learn how to socialize outside the context of school and coop, the better. Not only will they like you more, but they will also be far more willing to cooperate at work. This is precisely what coop prepares you for."
"Campus protests do not restrict speakers from coming to campuses. So banning protests is a restriction of free speech. Protesting someone speaking does not go against free speech. Protestors do not restrict speakers, but the government banning protestors restricts students. "
"Even worse than that. You don't need to input repeating numbers.

For example: if your lock code is 484, you can unlock by inputting 84 or 48.

You can legit unlock any KW4Rent doors under 3 minutes. Personally have done it on my friends' doors to show them how fucked it is."
"Exactly that’s my point lmfao.

If you average of the gpa of the marks listed above, it won’t be a 3.7.

You originally said “80% average”, not “over 80% average”"
"I don't wear my tightest skinny jeans in the winter anyways cuz they're not as warm so I've NVR had a problem with them not fitting underneath.

"Reach out to your Feds student council rep - they can get something started! That's also how the MC air quality assessment started.

"Really? That seems counter-intuitive. Although now that you mention it, the only person I indirectly know who got killed in a mugging was a guy. Maybe guys think less about stuff like that and so are more likely to put themselves in situations where they could be in danger? "
"Related: the Feds GM is tomorrow at noon in the SLC and you should go!

"That was a shit course that was really subjective lmao. My lowest mark in university by far even though I've won debate and public speaking awards, am involved in many business presentations and competitions, and got a high 90 in IB English. Definitely would NOT recommend it"
The thing about 136 for me was that it seemed very abstract.  Lin alg takes a while to get the intuition for 3blue1brown helped a lot but it was still really hard for me to visualize it irl. Proofs were just a lot more logical and intuitive for me. I dropped like a good 20% 
"Yeah, if you enter DWE by the entrance nearest SCH and you go all the way down the staircase right there, you can walk over to RCH underground. If you're headed on to E2/E3 and you don't want to go outside then it's a lot faster than detouring all the way around DWE and CPH."
"for me motivation isn't helpful as it comes and goes, but discipline helps a lot more. Just sit down and start reading the coursework or start doing a problem and then once you get into it, its much easier to keep doing work. Its starting the work that is a problem usually. "
"totally depends on the employer, but i've met a few CS people taking 3 courses a term and doing OK in coop. also, Dan Wolczuk took 4 courses a term for his entire undergrad! if you're having a better experience and you don't mind graduating a few terms later, then why not :)"
"For me it’s been mostly quality/testing jobs in medical imaging, digital health/medical devices and now wearables. I have friends in research for major hospitals/universities, software, bioinformatics, biomaterials, imaging and orthotics. Lots of BMEs also get non BME jobs, like at top tech companies, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR and AI. I wouldn’t say there’s one dream job, everyone tends to have different career goals in mind.

There’s a wide variety of BME-related jobs, but also opportunities to try other industries "
"The BDSM/fetish community at this amazing institution is wonderful. I have conducted a thorough online analysis of the University of Waterloo and have found that in almost all aspects this university is simply the best. No wonder people often use Waterloo's name besides MIT, Stanford, UC Berk, etc. I can only dream that this prestigious university will look at my posts and realize from my demonstrated interest in this university that I deserve to be offered the opportunity to study Bachelors of Computer Science Honours Co-op."
"There's definitely time to transfer if it's what you really want. It's true that if you are good at programming you'll have a better chance at getting a good co-op (if you're definition of ""good"" is strictly making money, working on newish tech, and going cool places) but if you'd be doing stuff you don't enjoy, then it's not really ""good"" for you. 

You can get dope co-ops in other eng programs, but it may be harder. But I'd recommend trying not to think about co-ops too much and think more about your ideal career direction."

Just clap back asking the girls weight if shes a stickler for height. "
This is what happens when the school allows such a high enrollment in advanced math by curving them so hard that people misjudge their abilities to handle the more advanced courses. The score distribution will look perfectly reasonable if the height between 10 - 20 is halved.

* Our species values physical appearance so highly in so many situations.

* I have poor social skills due to being bullied or excluded as a child. This was almost certainly caused by the first point.

* I feel like almost everyone hates or barely tolerates me. This is based on both past and ongoing experiences with bullying or exclusion.

* I am depressed, which is part of a vicious cycle since my lack of friends only worsens the depression."
"If all the ""foreign individuals"" face general disdain and unfriendliness from their new environment, they're not going to try and assimilate either.

However depending on the prof if you're using an approved calculator that just doesn't have the pink tie/blue goggles they'll most likely allow it, especially for the generic Ti-30.

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, MathSoc sells the cheapest faculty approved calculators on campus...."
"Yes, switch now.  Find something that you like and can make a living doing.

I graduated about 10 years ago and I remember a classmate in your situation who wasn't passionate / motivated about engineering.  He didn't really like or study the material and ended up failing a few terms before getting kicked out.  He wasn't stupid either, in fact he was quite smart.  He came back and switched into math and business and ended up graduating.  I lost contact with him, but from what I last heard, it was the best decision he ever made."
"Ooh that's a good one�� cliche or not hahah I have no judgments there, its all interesting stuff imo, can't say any series etc around that come to mind right away though (did recently come across a couple about ancient civilizations themselves but haven't watched any yet so not sure if it'd touch upon how they came about or just how they *were*, will let you know once I do though) ��I don't even know tbh, I watch and have watched tons around ww1 and 2, tsars of Russia, 19th century russia, ancient Rome, the Ottoman empire, Karl Marx and his life, Edwardian farms, chunks of medieval times, the Victorian Era, catholicism vs protestantism in England and that bit, the Tudors, the French Revolution, the beginnings of some major religions etc etc etc �� 

Hm I can do Christmas carol melodies, some disney/pop/musical/movie songs, some of those ones like ode to joy or parts of swan lake, canon in d, etc ��just the main melody bits though. (I cant play it but do you happen to know 'spring waltz' by paul senneville ��)"

This is precisely why I tell other people **not** to attend our school lmao."
"1. Yeah, one go. But usually, I like to eat 3/4 of it then save the last 1/4 for a snack later.

2. https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9sg0c2/ama_request_24_lines_lazeez_kids/e8ojdt0/

3. At some point, I was eating this once a week so I got used to it pretty quickly."
"Ah ok I misinterpreted your meaning of long game then. That works fine but dating is largely a numbers game, so I typically advise people to just shoot their shot. Even if the success rate is lower, the time/emotional investment is very little and that makes it worth it to me."
"Business casual. For guys, dress shirt, dress pants, nice shoes. No tie. Ladies, a blouse, suit pants, something like that. Other genders, not sure tbh, but make sure you dress in a way that you’d feel comfortable being in an office. Dress/suit pants are never a bad option. "
"Forty people who leave school because they don't need a degree every year seems high.

I think the reason people fail more in CS is mostly social. From what I have seen in class, a lot of people have no support network of friends or family. We should compare SE and CS and see."
"How much easier does it get to get interviews after getting a good tech company on your resume? One of Facebook, Uber, Google, LinkedIn?

I got an offer from one of them luckily because I had 4 interviews in total, so I am wondering if it makes it any easier to get interviews."
"I got 44 lmfao, thats a yikes from me. not going to lie, i probably could have put more effort into it but got caught up with other shit. if u decide to stick with it, HMU if u wanna work on future assignments, i also heard it gets easier but yeah, A2 doesnt look fun either..."
"Idk that's just how this comes across to me.

If there's something you want to do, then do it.

&gt; Rather, my goal is to find a direction and dedicate myself to self-improvement for the rest of life.

It sounds like you already have yourself figured out more than most here. "
"Interviewer randomly asks ""why is your AFM 391 mark so low?"" because it's the lowest mark on my transcript. We had Lynn Carty and Thomas Manning, the worst profs in AFM history and I told the interviewer it was because the profs were shit and I ended up not getting the offer. "
"Isn't invidia in Australia? Honestly, worst exhaust I ever had on my car. Got a hole in it after 9 months, and then their customer service was shit. Wanted me to ship it all the way to Australia before they would even decide. Would have cost me more than the exhaust was worth."
Lol there’s like a million churches. I was raised Christian but im non practicing too. Although you said “if you don’t mind a bit of religion”- i think it’s either you’re religious and go to church or you’re not religious enough to do that. Idk maybe I’m wrong.
"Not server developer, but this term they were offering 28 per hour + 250 travel stipend monthly. They reached out for SRE position, it was flat out compensation they were offering(independent of work term/ experience). I'd imagine Server Dev could be less or equal to 28. Gluck"
"Office tours and visits might be technical, but if it's a startup then it might also be to meet members of the team and they'll see how how you get along with them! So be a little prepared to ask everybody a few questions and have quick conversations here and there. Good luck!"
"They literally did. If no one ever tells them their behavior is completely unacceptable in this country, why would they ever change it?

Threatening them is unwarranted. But I doubt that even happened, they seem to misinterpret everything as a threat. Speaking from experience."
"This isn't really a shower thought, it's a well known **fact** for anyone who dealt with CECA
  
CECA works for the employers and protects the university image, not UW students. I mean I can advertise 100% employment rate too if I remove everyone that's unemployed from my data"
"Throwaway, VPN, private network and I'd actually feel shame if I posted a quiz that wasn't an absolute joke. People need to see the quality of education of some courses at Waterloo and hopefully future students see this and don't enroll in this course with this terrible prof. "
"Well... She clearly states she's not looking for a relationship, which means she's looking to fuck.

She also went on a date with this guy which means he was a potential candidate.

The guy wasn't fuckable enough for her, or he just didn't make the move, which results in this."
"Yeah but during exam season, that bird course can come back and fuck you, since it makes your schedule tighter so you have less time to study for the real courses and you have to catch up since you half assed the bird course all term. At least that's what happened to me in 1A."
"[Math 55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_55) is the most difficult first-year math class in North America. (Except they don't say ""first-year"" in the US.)

Think you're up for it? Try the [Math 55 final examination](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/M55a.02/absolut.pdf)."
they said i’m not getting my key deposit back since the key returned does not have their stamp on it... its the same fucking key i got from them 2 years ago. It’s already illegal to charge over $50 for key deposits and now this. How did this shithead company last till now?
"I would just fess up.  Tell him/her you are willing to write an alternative exam or do whatever it takes, that it was a mistake on your part and you are solely to blame.  If they believe you are forthright they may bend, although don't expect even if they do that you will not incur a penalty of some sort.  You could actually stipulate your realize that there has to be a consequence but you would like to obtain some mark if at all possible.

But don't wait a week.  if this was today you should be at the profs office an hour ago."
"Well....Khabib drop kicked first so i think the whole arguement is out the fucking window for you if you wanna be like that. Fight the fighter, take your paycheck, your belt, your ""honor"" that he claims to hold so highly, and gowan home. I dont understand whats so hard to understand about that when it comes to mma. Khabib started the whole end of that fight, 3 were arrested and let go. Khabib now had to deal with legal shit and has stupidly risked his career, and no finger pointing at conor will ever change that. I dont get what defence youve been trying to concoct. First its cuz he got ""bullied"" then its bc he was ""full of adrenaline"" and now its ""conor started it"" fucking ridiculous man. Your fighter fucked up his career bad. Take the actual L cuz Conor already recognized his."
"Yes, you retain your IP. If you are working in a research group the division of the IP can be a contentious issue, with the PI of the group usually getting some percentage.

Also if you go through WATCO in order to get your patent, they get 30% of revenue generation and commercialization rights (but they cover all the lawyer fees/paper work).

For this case, the tricky part seems to be;

&gt;The university accuses Salient of misappropriating its business opportunities, and wants the right to license the battery technology to the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory — which, it argues, funded the startup's research in the first place.

So that funding might have included some IP rights attached to it.

I guess they got their own lawyer for filing the patents?"

"Decreasing marginal returns with each subsequent year.

~50% of my brightest independent-minded classmates did not stay to degree completion. 

It becomes more about signalling obedience than competency.

Anecdotal outcome: every single one of such are successful by any metric."
"Get really good at finding integrals, example problems are super easy to find. There are indeed plenty of proofs on the exams (especially compared to high school calc), but I'm not sure exactly how much since I think they've changed how the course is structured since I took it."
"I don’t know what his gpa was and unfortunately, he’s the only one I know who has transferred to UW from another school. Honestly, if you are thinking about transferring, it wouldn’t hurt to try. At least you wouldn’t have to keep wondering if you would have gotten in. "
"I think she said the relationship thing after the date, and it could just mean she doesn’t like him enough for a relationship and she’s trying to let him off easy.

He could’ve not made the move, but it seems like he actually likes her and doesn’t just want to fuck her."
"It's called ""post secondary education"" not ""euphemistic polytechnic college"" for a reason. 

go to Laurier or Western or UoT for all the same reasons the wealthy white men sent their sons there.  You are in the wrong school, my dear, jump now before the cold Atlantic takes you."
"Jesus, what's the point of the whole denial circle jerk in the comments. Maybe if a company is telling you all the things youre doing wrong, you should try and fix some of them.
That part about the UofT applicant including their school rank on their resume had my dying tho ngl."
"LMAO facts, too bad its the other way around. But i can definitely see where you’re coming from. I’m almost certain that one day if we’re no longer together, intentional or not, she will be the reason why. They already talk more than we do, and thats definitely alarming. "
"Nothing too in-depth, they don't quiz you on their history or anything like that. It's just that Assuris is kind of a unique entity in the industry (being more of a regulatory agency) so when you're interviewing with them it looks good if you know your background information.  "
"Ok last guess. Start both logs at same time but one burn at both ends. When the both ends one is done light the second ones second end. When that’s done it’s been 30, so light the second end of the remaining log and it’s gonna be done at 45
Ok way easier than I thought..."
"The chicken is good, but I really like their kimbap! (original without cheese) They give you some candy when you order too, so that's pretty nice. The only thing is that at least the last time I was there, it was $7 per roll, which is kind of expensive compared to other places."
There's also a lot of people pushing for her to be a role model for women to go in physics by doing talks and going public about her achievement. I think the sole fact she won the award speaks of itself and should be sufficient to give girls the hope they can achieve something.
"Yeah the classic ""I got told not to use the N word so I shaved and tattoo'd a swastika on my ass and joined the Nazi party because I was oppressed"" act. I do love it when fascists stop pretending to be ordinary humans and take off their masks. Makes it much easier to deal with."
"You can always try living on campus. Get a locker from one of the faculties, and scout out good places to sleep. MC Comfy, Study Lounges, Hagey Hall, SLC, etc. Then you can shower in one of the showers available across campus. M3, ECH, E7, SJ, etc. Other option is to couch hop."
"You can petition to the landlord tenant board to have it ended early. You'd probably have a good case considering the fact that fire marshals cited them under fire code for unsafe living

Edit: You can also petition for rent refunds and further damages as suggested in the post."
"You just have to be willing to put up with the sketchiness of the townhouses and apartments at Westmount and Uni ;)

"You're still a registered student, so I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to. 

If this is semi-urgent / urgent, hospitals are always an option, and the walk-in clinic (while closed now) is also available.

"Except that we were a world leader on the subject. We housed research that there is literally no other space on this planet that could house it.

The Experimental Lakes Area project utilized the fact that we had enough lakes in close proximity that were largely untouched, the only of its kind in the world, that allowed us to do experimental ecological research in the field. This put us in a unique position regarding global climate science.

"I've heard about people having little trouble with laurier parties. I suppose you just have to get lucky.

I have heard that there are some parties that charge cover for guys, but they've always been worth it in terms of what you got for the cover.

Also I've heard of tons of jams at CLV/in various residences, which I suppose mostly applies ot first years, but that's who OP is going to be for a while anyways.

Yeah we're not queens, yeah we're not guelph, but there's still a bit of a nightlife, this is one giant university town."

"My average went up in uni but I'm aware that that's pretty rare.

"90 averages aren't impossible, not at all.  Just unlikely.

Pretty much every math class I've taken, the class distribution seems to be a nice normal bell curve with an average around 65-75.  That sure seems like 'most' people aren't getting 90 averages.

It's my speculation that pretty much everyone can get top quartile with a lot of effort.  Breaking into the top 10% (which I think is likely your 90 average) is much more difficult and may not be possible for everyone.  But again, possible for some folks with some heavy pushing."
"I disagree, the long game of ""become her friend first, and then her boyfriend"" almost never works. The relationship dynamics and the progression are just so different. It catches most girls off guard too, and you end up friendzoning yourself.

I'm not saying asking a girl on a coffee date has a 100% success rate. Obviously the success rate is better if you're attractive. And even then, you may get rejected a few times before you score a date. I still believe that its far better than the long game which some girls find misleading."
"Stay calm, what's the worst thing that could happen? You don't get the job - just keep applying until you get one. If you go in with that mentality, imo you'll be very confident and will crush the interview. Also be genuine, respectful and curious - a big part of interviews are evaluating if you'll be a nice person to work with. And as for the technical part, try grinding leetcode, stay calm even when you don't get the question immediately and try bouncing your thoughts off with the interviewer. Good luck, you're gonna crush it. "
"I'll preface by saying that I've dealt with a lot of depressed people in my personal life, both in my family and among friends. 

What's wrong with it? To me, it's a disease like cancer. Yes, some people can be treated and cured for the rest of their lives. But typically speaking, once you get it, you are susceptible to relapses every so often until the day you die. 

Not only does the depressed person suffer, his/her loved ones, and everyone around them also suffer as a result. Friendships get strained, families get ruined, etc. 

Does this mean I would abandon a loved one if they developed depression? No, I would help them get over it and try my best to make sure they don't relapse. But if anyone is given a choice, I think they'd prefer to not have to deal with it to begin with."
"""Feel like I'm living in China"" is a statement that feels slathered in racism.

Whether you think it is or not, you don't get to define the hard line between racist and not-racist. It's like pornography. You know it when you see it. Everyone else sees it.

That doesn't make everyone else wrong.

Canada is not a flat 75-80% white. You can't take a random sample of a Canada and expect 75% white because we have a very heterogeneous demographic.

Heres some example Wikipedia searches:

Waterloo: 78.7% European (White)

Toronto: 47.7% European (White)

Brampton 26% European (White)

There is no valid reason to expect that just because UW is in Canada that it should be 75% white europeans.

If your issue is specifically with new immigrants, then lets discuss why you should expect them here too:

One of the most common reasons for immigration is higher education. Canada has solid educational infrastructure and accepts immigrants so it's very reasonable to expect that there will be immigrants in university towns.

That's just a plain fact, and there's nothing you can do about it. University towns have more immigrants than similar sized towns.

So I don't know who you're complaining too. 

You're living in an amazing country. We have single payer healthcare, subsidized education, a functioning government (no matter which way you lean), and now even legal weed.

You and I were even *lucky* enough to be born here. I didn't do anything to earn this, I just showed up and held my hands out.

Immigrants want that life too, and they work for it. They work to send their kids here for some of the world's best schooling, and they do it without any of that support structure from the government.

They deserve to be here just as much, if not more than you and I. So lets be civil and not get angry when we happen to be faced with a demographic a little different from our small hometown.

(And yes, I came from a small town that was about 99% white. We had one indian family and yes, their kid even came to waterloo with me. I experienced the same culture shock.)"
"&gt;My classes for years have been completely dominated by Asian students, sometimes up to 95% (I've counted). My current program is at around 80% minimum.  
&gt;  
&gt;I guarantee some crybaby is going to call me racist in response to this post  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, I'm in CS, I'm international, I'm 100% East Asian, I agree with you 100%, and I don't think that's racist in the slightest. Truth is, this is not normal. I've been to several universities in Europe, and their CS schools are pretty much all native/domestic students.

I'll be that crybaby to call you two racist. Just because you are East Asian, it doesn't mean you get a free pass for racism. What is so abnormal about a huge diaspora of east asian people in Canada going to one of the most renowned universities in the country that they've emigrated to that has the highest probability of guaranteeing them a more stable financial future? The university overall is only roughly \~20% international students, the statistics are public and you can look it up before you use anecdotes to shape your view. The math faculty in particular is more but only at \~25%, since the math program is more well known worldwide and is more popular for international students. For the other \~75%, they are all domestic students. It is YOUR problem if you don't recognize the other \~75% to be Canadian domestic students just because they are a visible minority.  


&gt;I'm not an immigrant, but my God I feel like I understand what it's like to be one after being at UW for years. I've essentially been living in China for over 5 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;it feels so incredibly isolating. I don't know how people do it without going off campus all the time like me.

  
Now that you know exactly how it feels, it should occur to you that immigrants make huge social sacrifices in order to live in Canada. It was an rare opportunity for you to engage in cultural exchange with people who likely share similar values by virtue of being Canadian. You wouldn't even have an issue with any language barrier, pity you missed out."

"&gt; Psychopathy is traditionally a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. It is sometimes considered synonymous with sociopathy.

"1. Pretty much completely depends on your ECE 250 mark, math marks come second.

2. No you'll goto 2B, will be one term behind a CS student who started with CS135 but won't be late for graduating.

3. I transferred from another engineering (not ECE), but I don't regret it at all."
"Are you saying sexual assualt is bad but rape is malicious?

From studies of victims, sexual assault can be just as psychologically harming as rape. It doesn't matter if you were forced to have sex or not, someone groping you, putting their genitals on you etc. is very traumatic."
"Be prepared for a ""low"" score - the Euclid is a lot different from highschool math, much less focus on memorisation and more on thinking. Tbh doing math contests was the only thing that really got close to what I do in UW math (which is what you'd be doing first year CS anyways)."
"Did you enjoy your time with your boyfriend though? If you did that isn't no social life and it's still time you enjoyed, not wasted

People can hang out with friends and drift apart before/after graduation but that doesn't mean the time they enjoyed with their friends was wasted"
"Do not, DO NOT miss out on sleep trying to cram. You will never do better by showing up with 2 hours and the concentration of a 3rd grader. And of course as you found out the hard way, you might end up shutting down and sleeping through your alarm. Don't make this mistake again. "

2. If this fails, then begin a war of attrition. Purchase an airhorn and use it to wake him up when he is sleeping, play loud music from your room while gone at class, etc"
"Hmm, I own less than five physical books and less than five things that could be considered toys, and no talent for art. If you do end up bringing some of it, you can try keeping it in plastic storage bins? That way you can stack your stuff vertically and it'll take up less space"
I am actually not applying from grade 11. I geard they use grade 11 marks to predict grade 12. So for English would they use my grade 11? Or only until they get an idea of what my grade 12 mark is like? If they use my 50 from grade 11 I wouldnt even meet the minimum requirements.
"I dont know what other courses u take this term, if the workload is heavy for them, it's not that possible for u to spend too much time only on this course for final preparation. So it's a little bit risky to write the final for 100% weight, but it depends on ur time arrangement."
"It's a Chinese tutoring service that is popular and widely accepted by the international Chinese students attending this school.

The tutors are typically former TAs or smart students who want to earn some extra cash, and so they'll teach students solutions to recycled questions."
Its best not too risk it. Im pretty sure its not an official ticket so the rental company is not required to pay but they will probably expect you too regardless. I've had a few tickets over the years and I ended up being forced to pay them although the woman cut the fine by 75%.
"Just have to maintain above a 60 average for science, (I believe 70 for Environment). Failure rate isn’t high, but drop out rate is. When you’re paying 20-30k a year for tuition, it’s hard to afford unless you come from a wealthy family or have good enough credit for loans."

"Not OP but you could always throw something like:

""Given what we've talked about so far, and the other people you've spoken to, do *you* think I'd make a good fit for the position?""

The answer can be pretty indicative of how they feel about you relative to the other candidates."
"Same scenario here tbh. The first paragraph sounds like:

"Thank you so much, do you mind if I asked which program you are in right now and how’s the job so far? I think it’ll be much easier to get a job that you actually have learned something about during your school. I will probably go for a program that could prepare me for that."

"In order of what I think would be good. 

1) Lease the space - drop fees too, maybe? Much like many people, I don't use the bomber and would rather just get a few (2, 3?) dollars back.   
2) Franchise - this isn't likely, but maybe the bomber could be replaced with something I'd actually want. No idea what would be a good fit for there, McDonalds seems like an ok suggestion  
3) Rebrand - any change that doesn't cost more money is probably for the better to me  
4) Status Quo. It's a waste of money for all purposes that affect me "
"It's a bs bellcurving attempt.  Guaranteed your class had too high an average and prof needed to bring it down or be forced to spend a ton of time revising course materials (you know, like an actual educator).  This was one of the least imaginative attempts I've seen though.  The answers are all so close to ""approximate"" correctness that they could all be considered correct.  He then just has to choose, afterwards, which answer he will accept.  If he wants to bring the class average down a lot, he chooses the least popular answer."
"The problem with that is that if you don't allow smoking weed in public, people will complain and use the justification that ""people can smoke cigarettes in public!""  


Honestly, I really am not a fan of anyone smoking *anything* or vaping in public, so I'm not defending it. I have (relatively mild) asthma and it honestly makes me cough my fucking lungs out. So I'm really not a fan.  


And besides, people smoke (and drink) in public even when it's banned. I really fucking hate it, but people can be inconsiderate dicks sometimes."
"We're all equally as upset as you are about this. As councillors, we don't know the nitty-gritty details of the ""why"" behind it - since it's tucked away in the board-confidential commercial services budget. However, we've made enough of a fuss about it at the September council meeting to put it on Board's agenda, and this Sunday we'll be giving a presentation to council to keep the pressure on.

We've also been given assurances by board directors that this is very much on their radar and they're working on turnaround plans to make Bomber profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; (and don't spin that bull that it's not ""in this year's budget"" because it's obviously still from past student fees)

Right, it's from organizational savings (aka past student fees), which doesn't make it any better."
"This will sound stupid, but you need helpful distractions.

There will be times when you'll burst in tears at random. Those days you will need people to lean on.   
It might be hard to accept that, but you gotta do what you gotta do. The only thing that sucks more than crying uncontrollably is to cry uncontrollably alone.

&amp;#x200B;

A good counsellor can have a powerfully positive impact on your life. Get weekly counselling.   


Lastly talk about a reduced load program with your advisor/undergrad office, where you only take 3 courses this term &amp; miss a future co-op term (or summer) to make up for it. That way you don't lose your group of friends :)   


My condolences for your loss.   


Early this year, I lost someone I was inseparable from. It sucked. I was 7 seas away at that time.  
I couldn't even make it home in time for their funeral. Had to do the last rites via FaceTime.  
Despite crying non-stop for 2 weeks straight, I found strength.   
Gradually I started remembering them by their celebration of life.   
I am their legacy. I share that fabric of greatness with them.  
They live within me now. Perhaps someday I'll mean that much to my own younglings.  
Fuck cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting condolences from people sucks, but understand they only mean the best for you.   
Most times those people would legitimately provide any help needed, including a loving &amp; unconditional embrace.  
   
Use your rage and tears to your advantage.   
Be kind and merciful to yourself and those grieving."
"I came in to UW with no previous work experience, like most people. I had a half decent project that I did in Grade 12. It was relatively technically interesting game; some OpenGL, a lot of networking, a couple interesting algorithm approaches. I decided very late to go into CS, so I didn't have a lot of time to do stuff in advance. The game itself was shit, but it had some technical flash. I did a programming contest and had a pretty nice result, but that didn't help me much imo. 

So basically I spent 1A and 1B trying to grind side projects and get good at technical interviews. I mean, looking back I really wasn't very good, but I definitely was stronger than the majority of my class after a while, though well short of the IOI level guys. I worked a fair bit with my friend who is one of those prodigy types to improve. Basically, it's going to be tough to get an opportunity. So when you get a good opportoonidy, you need to make the most of it. If you fail a Jane Street or Google interview, tough luck, it happens. But under no circumstances should you fail an entry level Canadian dev interview. There's no excuse.

So I was planning to apply to jobs in May-June, and I was starting out from late August. My strategy would best be described as casting a wide net. I did a simple mobile app (it was terrible don't even ask) and a web dev project. Wide net, at least at first.

So fast forward to May, I got totally shut down in the first round of interviews, as you might expect. Rip me. Then in June I went to the continuous round. I had some non technical interviews resulting in ranks but not offers. Finally I got a full programming interview and - interviewers words, not mine - crushed everyone else. Got a full stack web dev job. Wouldn't touch web dev with a ten foot pole now, but it doesn't matter, because getting in the door is what counts. 

So basically my experience is that you have to set yourself up to strike when the chance comes. It's gonna be hard to get a chance, and you need to be patient. But it'll happen if you put in some work. "

"The classes aren’t hard conceptually, but a shitload to remember. Some of the concepts can be awkward to get your head around, because of the way they are explained, but there are a lot of resources you can use to help you!

"What.

"From what I can tell from those notices, they basically say the fire system is not functioning correctly, and has been flashing malfunction for the last year and a half. They have been offically ordered to fix it as of that notice date. 

If you walk by the units like 130-8 you can hear the panels beeping, which indicates they aren't working, which isn't up to fire code

Edit: looked at the notice on my way out, they have 15 days to comply from sept 17th with the order, so it's at the point where it is non compliance with fire code"
"Hey if you were working on a big project on a coop that your team lead's been hyping to upper management and then they shit all over you and your team during the presentation and decide you dont deserve a raise youd be upset too. Cuz this definitely has a big effect on Conors future earnings and he knows it, plus regardless of trash talk he still likes to put on a good show and he wasnt able to do it for his fans. A loss like that no one could take easily. Khabib wouldve prolly thrown a fit worse than what he did already if he lost"
"I don't think I'm being selfish. I never said anyone was obligated to help me, or anyone. In fact I've stated in previous posts that no one is entitled to kindness let alone friendship.

If you don't want to help someone with depression, that's fine. Like you said, that's not your job. However, if all you do is refer them to counseling, you should know that that's not helpful.

Anyways, if you want to help someone with depression, just talking to them is a great start. Maybe take a minute to Google ""how to help a depressed friend""."
"When I said Asian culture I meant East Asian culture, I thought that was clear from context.

Anyways, I think you're getting caught up in the specifics of what I said. If Allen says ""I like girls with {set of characteristics that, as a whole, are extremely common for ethnic East Asians and extremely rare for non-East Asians}"" and Bert says ""I like East Asian girls"", what is the effective difference between those two statements? 

Racism is a pretty big thing to accuse someone of. Why is Bert's statement so much worse than Allen's?"
"Also, rather than saying ""I'm here for you,"" actually ask them to do things. I appreciate anyone that's ever told me they're there for me, but it's hard and scary to be the one that initiates when you're in a bad place. Asking your friend to hang out, making plans, and being compassionate if they cancel on you is really important. They may still be sad and depressed when you're together, but at least in those moments they won't be (and hopefully will feel less) alone. Support them in getting help like counselling services or other counselling. If you start feeling overwhelmed as a supporting person, be real with yourself and set boundaries. It's wonderful that you're willing to help and by all means do, but if it's becoming taxing on you then you need to consider your health as well"
"Here's a couple things I do: 
1) handwrite notes, or at least the sections you struggle with most. Colour code them, so for example make definitions red, titles blue, etc. 
2) I find I work best outside of my house, where I have less distractions such as a cafe on or off campus. I frequently studied at Funken on campus! I also use a playlist of laidback songs to study with. Blocks out outside noise if needed and I focus more with music on.
3) depends what their level is. Its not mandatory to do the same as all your friends, but study groups or just asking them how they work could help! It won't happen overnight.
4) write out a plan of what you want to accomplish that day. Be realistic here, don't aim for more than you know you can manage. Be sure to include breaks of a few minutes every hour or two of studying. I look forward to refilling my coffee when I take breaks! Line your textbook with gummy bears or m&amp;ms. Get to that line and you get to eat it. Sometimes a gummy bear can be quite motivating! 

Hope something here helps :) "
"The Undergraduate Office's remark about shredding emails (and by extension, electronic correspondence and communication) is a joke. UW has records retention policies that extend to include emails and electronic correspondence for a minimum period of time for their staff, in maintaining the operations of the institution. This allows for ""transparency"", such as the fulfillment of Freedom of Information requests (https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-make-freedom-information-request). It doesn't matter that CECA staff chooses to ""delete"" the email from their inbox, or the Dean's Office chooses to shred the information, since they are legally required to retain the records for the minimum period of time. Time period iirc is at least 7 years.

On another note, I appreciate OP taking the time to share this story, and bring to light that CECA does not work in the best interest of students, but rather, for themselves/employers. I have had my own fair share of major and minor struggles with CECA over the years, and it has always resulted in them backtracking on what they said they would do/have done, or they'll take the issue to my associate dean. It has always resulted in them ignoring my emails for clear resolution, or not following through with taking it to the associate dean.

��We got History��
"136 is easier than 135 for the bulk of people, but 138 seems to be a course where people seem to either perform very well or very poorly. I found 136/138 easier personally, but I know a lot of my friends did worse in 138 than 137 since it was new content and it goes pretty quickly."
"Do your taxes.

You don't get doubly taxed, you get taxed for roughly the higher of US or Canadian taxes (roughly because there are charges you have to pay regardless, like OHIP premium), which is just Canadian taxes generally speaking. It is about 20% of your total income usually."
"First and foremost, I wasn't knocking on the wall I was building furniture. Next, it wasn't for 12 hours straight, more like 2 hours so check your facts. And finally I make furniture as a side hustle so try to show some respect for another man's job, I'm just tryna make some bread."
"I don't know much about the way FEDS works tbh, but thanks for modifying it from the original policy. Specifically targeting and banning one movement is absurd and flies in the face of the freedom of speech the students purportedly voted to protect in the referendum two years ago. "
"I wonder if they have been any people in 4th year who take some course that's known to be super hard without knowing (like Big 3 CS courses, idk what ECE has) and then end up either suffering because they want to graduate on time or drop out after the add deadline and graduate late"
"Its not a he, but I don’t want to mention any names. The issue is a thicc accent combined with mumbling while facing the black board and a severe lack of effort and time put into explaining concepts. I’ve dealt with profs that have accents before and have been fine with it btw "
"Like a week or so. I should not have said anything this soon, I just 100% thought she felt as into me as I am with her. She's definitely into me, but I don't think she's ever had a boyfriend. She also seems very confident and independent and probably doesn't want to feel tied down."
"Math to CS is very very difficult. They have made it more competitive this year (you can't just get an 80 and get in).

This specifically applies to CS as so many people want to transfer to CS. You would be competing with incoming high school students AND other transfer applicants."
"Only certain buildlings on campus will be closed for the night tomorrow; see [this post](https://uwaterloo.ca/plant-operations/news/electrical-power-shutdown-multiple-buildings-oct-9) by Plant Operations.

tl;dr: buildings north of QNC will be closed because there's a power outage."
"People are gonna find some way to get weed, legal or not, and it’s costly to enforce the weed ban. The government gets a lot more tax money and stop spending so much for catching illegal drug dealers. Also, 
 weed being illegal might discourage people from seeking addiction help."
"Squats and deadlifts hit everything you need, but most people have left-right imbalances (in strength, coordination or both), particularly beginners, so you should ideally be supplementing them with unilateral work. For legs, Bulgarian split squats and walking lunges are excellent."
"We have no idea whether or not second-hand smoke from legalized cannabis will cause cancer because we don't know what additives will be added to commercial cannabis. After all, it's not tobacco that causes most forms of lung cancer due to cigarette smoke, but all of the other junk."

"THAT'S EXACTLT what I've done so far, just getting the assignments done the night before and studying for midterms 2 days before. I regret not doing things in advance, but because I already didn't I'm in a position now where I need to go back and re-learn all the fundamentals to understand the stuff I'm being taught right now, and because I'm relearning all that other stuff I'm not keeping up with current lessons which leads me to cramming the night before an assignment AGAIN... And I'm kind of in a vicious loop right now. Any tips?"
"That's for you to decide, my dude. Just don't go out of your way giving her rides, helping with hw etc if it's inconvenient to you. Don't show your dependence on her or she might make use of that. If she said she isn't looking for a boyfriend you can't convince her otherwise and none of your evenings spent together matter at this point. If you're looking for a relationship don't waste your time with her, go look for someone else. If she changes her mind she'll reach out herself. And most importantly don't be bitter to her for this. "
"There are countless beautiful studying places at the top tier University.  I have conducted a thorough online analysis of the University of Waterloo and have found that in almost all aspects this university is simply the best. No wonder people often use Waterloo's name besides MIT, Stanford, UC Berk, etc. I can only dream that this prestigious university will look at my posts and realize from my demonstrated interest in this university that I deserve to be offered the opportunity to study Bachelors of Computer Science Honours Co-op."

"70% is /fine/

I'd also strongly recommend actually having an understanding of what's going on; the labs are more of an introduction to the scientific method, the content is just a medium for it.

Knowing what's going on will strongly benefit you for the final.

Also log-log plots. "
"Check for anemia. There is a famous [reddit post that became an internet sensation](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432163/Caught-napping-Intern-falls-asleep-desk-day-work-colleagues-did.html) about a guy that fell asleep during his internship, apparently caused by anemia."
"Congrats! I hope you find yourself enjoying your time and relaxing after work in Cali next term =) . Or at the very least sleep more. Srsly, how did you survive on 6 hours of sleep a day if you woke up 4 am or something (I need at least 9-10 hours to have a chance solving leetcode)?"
"Context, it’s important.  It also has to do with what school your coming from as well as your extra curriculars.  For example you could get accepted into comp sci with 90s if you have experience working as a dev for a company, or say you get a recommendation letter from some prof."
"Don't worry, if your class does well enough on the midterm he'll fuck you hard on the final. He asspulled LaPlace transformations out of nowhere as the last question in MATH 117 when it's not a part of the course because the class average was like a 71% and he wanted it to be a 65%."
"Go to the doctor and exaggerate the pain your getting. Then get a doctor’s referral to a massage therapist. Then go for massage therapy(I recommend Waterloo Sports Medicine), and then you can claim 80% of the massage therapy cost up to $400 through your FEDS/GSA health insurance. "
He’s basically making the second quiz that we’re gonna have 20% for the ppl who got 0 on the first one.  I’m pretty sure he’s still doing the same shitty format-one question. And well if you get that question wrong..... 20% down the drain and F in the chats. ��‍♂️ 
"I believe offers have already been scheduled out, so sadly if you are still waiting for a call from the recruiter its probably over. Given today is Tuesday, they give you 48hrs to accept/reject the offer, so it's unlikely that they would schedule call for tomorrow. Good Luck though!"
"I found that site too... but idt that's them. If you click on contact us, they have a list of offices and none of them are in waterloo (I'm going to the waterloo office for the interview so i know it exists)

edit: do you think a start up can have this many offices around the world?"
"I know, I know, but I was to stuff some leafy green shit in my vape a take a big fat rip of it, while I marvel at how the government went from arresting me for carrying this substance, to selling it to me, in the span of 24 hours. Then, I'll jack off to Libertarian Porn. Ya feel me?"
"It's not okay in the vast majority of scenarios, especially at work, but making a court case out of it and complaining about it for years seems extremely neurotic and frankly insane.

It seems even more bizarre to me that other people would discuss a 0.5 second ass touch for years. "
"Its like 90% eyeshadow and I dont even wear eyeshadow and I have so many already that I need to get thru first.

I bought the clinique cheek pop palette already and that might be the only holiday thing I get this year. Its so good. 100% worth even tho I already own black honey pop. "
"Not only did I fail, but I failed terribly. Like I didn't even need to go to class to do that poorly. Like I really could have stayed home instead of taking this midterm. Ugh. Idk I am a stats major and I need to take this class. Is there anyway to salvage this grade because jesus. "
Technically it is in my top 6 but is there any way to ask the university to not consider it at all to avoid any deductions. If they substitute in my next highest mark which  my average would only drop about .3 % which I would be fine with considering they could deduct upwards of 5%.
"Well, if you're lucky, a good set of friends to keep you going.  Otherwise, not much else I find good.  I guess the selection of beer they have in this city is aight.  Lots of different kinds of craft beer, but idk if you're old enough to drink.

If you mean the subreddit, not much."
"for 2022 rank 3 couldn't transfer successfully, rank 1 did 

It's easier to transfer if you a have a prof who's willing to go up to bat for you - Andrew Kennings has done it before, but I don't know the details. PW might be willing to help as well, I'll ask him tomorrow for you lol "
"I'm in the same boat. I only handed in q1, was almost done q3 but i just couldn't get it working in time. I'm not exaggerating when i say i put 60-80 hours into this assignment, only to have only 1 question handed in. I'm almost furious, it's caused me to really doubt myself. I have another course, which i have 100% in atm, i've already technically passed the course. I have never doubted myself as badly as I do now. I got a tutor to help me through the rest of the course, I just want to do well... I hate myself for how bad i'm doing."
"If you’re talking about the one in Halton Hills, it’s pretty good. Usually around a 20-40% discount in most stores. If you ever get the chance go down, check them. I’ve found it to be either a hit or miss situation in my opinion. You may find some good stuff, but in the past 5 years I have yet to see any major discounts (above 60% or so) and parking sucks. I recently went a few days ago, and winter selections have been put up. But as mentioned before, if you plan on being here for more than one winter, invest in a good jacket. "
"It's usually easy to transfer into enve/geo since there's usually at least a bit of space. In my experience civil sometimes is full. As long as it's not full though, it's easy to transfer until after first year.

It's not particularly competitive to get into compared to a lot of the other engineering disciplines, but you still need decent grades. That admission averages linked is probably the best guideline you'll find.

If you've got other questions about the program, feel free to ask here or PM me. I've recently graduated from it. "
"It was one of my 2 majors.  But when I say alum i mean from the 80's.  I had heard they don't curve as much anymore but I think the first year courses are much easier now.  Before anyone gets a head up of steam about that statement pls remember back then we came from Grade 13, and entrance into math at UW required the following 4 Grade 13 courses: Calculus, Algebra, Functions &amp; Relations, and really Physics as well.  So you have an understanding of how different it was our gr 13 high school physics course had a substantial amount of calculus in it.  So we went into first yr Math with a much, much deeper base then you obtained out of grade 12 and the first yr UW courses were geared to that knowledge base. 

Waterloo was really working on building its reputation in the 80's and the profs were positively viscous about putting us in our place.   Even in 3rd yr I remember one C&amp;O course where not a single person had an avg over 50 prior to it being curved - in fact on the final exam which was supposed to be a 1 hr exam but 3 hrs later we were all still writing and no one was finished more then about 60% of it.  We were even talking to each other during the exam trying to puzzle it out and the prof just laughed and did not care.

Out of the 44 students on my floor in residence (V2 but now I understand has a diff name) I recall we lost several to the dreaded Christmas phone call (my memory says we lost 10 but I don't guarantee it was that many).

But they have to pass a notable portion of every cohort or the faculty would be empty by 3rd and 4th yr.  Especially now given how the university is driving to increase in size, which it was not so much focused on back then.

Hence my advice to take it in stride.  I feel it is easy for students today to easily get lost in the minutia and not see the big picture.

As an aside one of my observations from following the reddit threads this year is it seems every student is an army of one.  Perhaps its due to the ability to access forums such as this and other online resources but back then as we had none of these mediums available we did a lot more student with student and students in groups studying - far more direct interaction and collaboration.  We used to go into the math lecture halls in the evening and start working through problems on the board together.  We would hit the study areas together.  I hardly remember a time when I was working alone for long periods of time.  Now all I am reading is about everyone being alone and tackling all the learning alone and it being hyper competitive with fellow students .   When I attended it was not us against each other, it was us against the profs whom we knew were out to get us.  Not it seems like its both against each other and against the profs.  One of those is a choice IMHO.

Anyways, let me close with saying perspective is important.  I have no doubt all of you are intelligent, capable individuals.  Don't let any one matter, or even a spell of ""bad luck"" throw you off track - especially in first yr.   And maybe remember there is strength in numbers..."

you're not even interviewed.
"I ate lunch today. In fact, I eat lunch every day.

&gt; not like 95% of the fucking world has one too

Given that only roughly 50% of the population is male and much less than 90% of the females are homosexual, I'm going to have to go out on a limb and say it's really not like that."
"No anecdotal experience. I did some research a couple years back when interested in shrooms.

Some varieties of psilocybin mushrooms can grow in this region, but they are uncommon. Unless you are a mycologist, it's easy to mistake potentially poisonous mushrooms as the ones you want."
"There are more resources available than anyone could ever use. Head to the first year engineering office in E2 and talk to an academic advisor. Most of your grade is made up by finals, unless you get near 0 on everything else you're a long way from failing right now if you seek help."
"There's not much really because alot of that is on your friend. Like the best thing you can do is just be there for your friend and do some activities together to de-stress from studying. I'm sure everyone else is probably feeling the same thing, just people react to it differently. "
You can take a term off without falling behind or leaving your friends. You're in engineering so you would probably be scheduled for coop next term. Take this term off and convert your coop to a study term. You only need 5/6 coops to graduate so it won't delay your graduation either.
if you want something for blogging wordpress is pretty easy to set up.  just buy a domain and server space (both very cheap) and set one up.  Most hosting services even have an option to set it up for you.  Wordpress also offers a version to host on their servers for like $5 a month.
"lots of cozy spots in e5/6/7 many don't require u to be in eng, the env cafe has couches and study tables (if no one is there just flick the light on). but if you want to stay in that STC hall chances are no one will stop you. at the most someone may just tell you to leave eventually"
"you don't have to settle my dude. There's a guy out there for you. I know what it feels like to never be able to find someone you're genuinely attracted to, but imo you just have to trust that it'll come. Your life is way to special to spend it with someone who you're not crazy about"
What do you think about creating a small crosswalk between CLV and the bus stop on the other side of Columbia? There are two stops (one near West mount and the other opposite the far side of CLV) and most students have to run across the road to catch the bus at the first stop. (It's a 7 minutes walk to go all the way around and through the actual traffic intersection.) The cars on Columbia go really fast (definitely above speed limit) and I'm worried it will take some poor student actually getting hit before anything is done about it.
"&gt; With the way most rental companies in Waterloo behave, it would be unrealistic to expect to get a deposit back without hassle.

Yup, pretty much.

&gt; ""you just need to consider the deposit as part of the rent"" seems to imply that we should just accept it when rental companies don't give back the deposit

Nope, you inferred that.

Here is my original comment, give it a read:

&gt; At this point, if you are renting from a company, you just need to consider the deposit as part of the rent.

It's simple, if you see a rental offering from one of these companies and there is a deposit, you need to add that to the advertised rent then compare that number to other rental offerings. This is why I didn't rent from one of these companies, after doing this calculation, they're not worth it."
"A lot of unnecessary stress. Turn these doubts into goals and use the energy spent on worrying to achieve them. Also point of importance is that university is not as free time as you may think, so don't feel too bad about not being in the optimal position to have crazy new experiences. At every point in life you are gonna have commitments, they just change as you grow older. For ex, right now you're committed to grades + career. In the future committed to family (I assume). I think everyone gets these doubts often, it's just a matter of perspective tbh. 

I don't like to think that your potential for happiness declines with age. Don't know if there's a correlation there. 

TL;DR The grass is always greener on the other side, and focus on working with what you have to do what you want. "
"For lunch I usually get stuff from the plaza; Subway is usually my go-to, but I'll also hit up Splus sometimes for the 2 for 12 deal, sometimes if I have time to kill I'll head to Shinwa. 

For dinner if I'm cooking it'll usually make a bunch of rice and stirfry some veggies (usually cabbage), then stirfry some meat as well. It could just be pork rolls (which I'll usually throw a curry mix in) or ground pork (good for mapo doufu). Stir-fry is generally foolproof anyway, throw the stuff in there long enough and it'll cook, and throw in enough soy sauce / other seasoning, it'll taste good. 

I generally buy groceries from the Chinese grocery store, but I will go to Walmart at times, and I'm entertaining the thought of using the Lime scooters to head down to Valu-mart for grocery shopping"
"A University is different than a building which requires security clearance or places where you are interrupting their work.

It's a place of learning. Not a place of censorship.

Comparing Faith Goldy (for example) to flat earth theory and anti-vaxxers is ridiculous. A social, moral, religious etc. argument is not scientific and cannot be understood in objective terms.

The only argument presented has been ""she's not intellectual"" or ""she hurts my fee fees"". Grow up. Seriously.

&gt; not all speech warrants a soap box

And yet we have CNN and FOX spewing absolute nonsense 24/7. We can allow other speech without being violent moronic children about it. That's what this is about.

If you don't think it's a human right to have freedom of speech, in an absolute sense, not just the government restricting it, then we have nothing to discuss here.

Your rhetoric sounds almost identical to all of the SJWs who were posting on LSPIRG and other pages during the Shepherd and Goldy fiascos so I really doubt there is any point to this conversation. "
"&gt; But it's complicated - I don't call where my parents live home.

fair enough, I won't pry into that. I certainly wouldn't want to live with my family anymore either, probably for different reasons but yea.

&gt;  I think it's ludicrous that even the notion of having more foreign students than domestic ones is conceivable in this country

I mean to be fair, the ""domestic"" students are also 2nd, rarely 3rd, generation foreigners too. My classes for years have been completely dominated by Asian students, sometimes up to 95% (I've counted). My current program is at around 80% minimum.

What I've learned in my time here is essentially that this is UW's marketing niche. They cater to a certain type of international and domestic student, and if you say anything about it, no matter how inane, you can get yourself into a lot of trouble (speaking from experience, and I guarantee some crybaby is going to call me racist in response to this post). They really ""accommodate"" these students, let's say... by having very light-handed punishments for plagiarism and other things international students are known for, for example. It brings in a lot of money - a lot of which you have to question where it's coming from in countries like China - and it pays their huge salaries at the end of the month. At some point you have to remember that the University is a business and not some Alexandrian 'place of enlightenment'. 

&gt; It might have something to do with my upbringing, but I don't think that's a good model. 

It's a good economic model... But it sacrifices literally every other part of life for the sake of monetary gain. That's essentially Canada's national model today.

&gt; And the fact that there's pretty much nothing to do here doesn't help either

Why would there be? This University is about funneling students to other places, and there are barely any (what I would call) 'legitimate' Canadians here to actually create anything resembling a community. 

I would think that this school is actually pretty awesome and full of life, if you're Asian... there are dozens of clubs, restaurants, and all sorts of unique services at your disposal. And you're surrounded by peers who had similar upbringings to you, share your cultural, social, and spiritual values etc. Doesn't sound so bad for them.

&gt; I feel like somebody ripped out a part of me when I moved here.

Same here, oddly enough. Although I didn't move very far. I am leaving Waterloo in a few months and it's forcing me to 're-discover' who I am, and it has been a gut-wrenching experience. I feel like this place was trying to force me to conform to a certain way of life that was just impossible for me to take on, so it has been a horrible experience over all and I would never recommend it to anyone... unless they are Asian. Then they might have a blast.

"&gt;I have no idea what the purpose of that was but it didn’t seem to benefit anyone  
  
It benefits the employer, it's CECA's job and they've did a fucking good job at it

"If it was non consensual then it's sexual assault. No it's not as traumatizing as rape but that's like saying ""oh so you're saying someone threatening with you with a knife is as bad as them stabbing you?""

"Set and setting are everything. 

And yes.

I was one of those people too though (with weed). Wasn't that way at all with psilocybin.

A bad trip with this stuff is just laying bare the worst things in your mind for you to see in bright light... you only have to fear yourself really. "
"Talking to other people after the 150 across all sections they found that the exam was on par in difficulty as the 105. I guess they might have to make it easier to avoid half the class failing? 

I’m actually looking forward to 117 for now.... definetly the highest mark midterm lol"
The whole motivation of these were that they were google glasses that don't look like google glasses. I mean they look like regular glasses until you see the thick side profile. Not a huge fan of it but it helps distinguish them from regular glasses which is good for marketting sake. 
"Yea. I want to minimize feeling like I'm in prison when I'm in loo and having my stuff with me helps. Also a big chunk of it are like.... household items like cleaning supplies, small appliances, and extra desks/chairs so it's not like I brought 3 SUVs worth of makeup and clothes lol."
"&gt;So I know that VOI is worth looking into but given I only have a day I want to know what the chances are of getting a deferment.

You can visit the walk-in clinic to ask the doctor for a doctor's note, which says that your condition is severe. Then, you e-mail your prof saying that unfortunately you're too sick to write his exam, and he'll likely want to see the note in person, so you visit him when you're feeling better.

I've seen cases where people visit the clinic the day of and during/after the exam to receive a doctor's note."
"I like plots where the protagonist or antagonist or both have traits and skills that don't exist in real life, but not to the extent that they're untouchable by regular humans, like Superman.

I like Katie Bishop picking up a goddamn bow ans going right back at a man that could wipe her out with a flick of his wrist, because it's the right thing to do. I like X-23 quipping about how scary a flaming wolverine is when her boyfriend drops her in a pond. I adore Gwenpoole's character development and fucking hate Mystique's smug villainry. "
"Mental health is one of the strongest aspects of the University of Waterloo.  I have conducted a thorough online analysis of the University of Waterloo and have found that in almost all aspects this university is simply the best. No wonder people often use Waterloo's name besides MIT, Stanford, UC Berk, etc. I can only dream that this prestigious university will look at my posts and realize from my demonstrated interest in this university that I deserve to be offered the opportunity to study Bachelors of Computer Science Honours Co-op."
"That's what I said. However, you had 20 ultrasounds and apparently a biopsy? Cancerous lymph nodes have a specific signature on ultrasound that would normally indicate further investigation. The fact that you've done so many (probably over a period of time) and doctors still refuse to investigate makes me pretty skeptical that it's anything malignant. I'm not a doctor though. I still think you should follow your cancer specialist's advice and cut your neck open to get a full biopsy done (more for your peace of mind than anything else)."

such cancer. I miss Burning Crusade when I could wreck essentially everyone with my warglaives, dragonspine trophy and Sunwell PvE gear while they ran around in Karazhan gear or shitty PvP items. "
"nah, i can vouch for Mr-Goose. it really depends on the program though.

for STEM programs, they post it on the board beside Tim Horton’s to induce competition amongst the fiercely competitive programs especially for CS, ENG and MATH. people also got really bored at the long line up that Timmys at SLC have, so they petitioned to make a mockery of people who have poor grades. this motion recently passed and is currently and/or will be effective once the finals are officially out and hence the grades will be posted on the boards at slc"
"Hentai is literally the fetishization of Japanese women, which is a concrete example of what you mean by ""fetishsizing a certain race"".

&gt;that it is a problem cuz you're involving other people in your fetish that didn't consent to being in it.

Hm. What you're promoting here is thought policing; a fetish is just a perversion. A thought/feeling/belief. Having consent from someone to include them in your fetishistic fantasies is the same as requiring consent just to think about someone.

If both parties are consenting to engage in the physical manifestation of said fetish, why is it important what the motives are? Consent to partake in a fetishistic act is impossible to require because what is and what isn't a fetish has no clear line. What if my fetish is super tame by your standards?"
"The way I understand it, there is a distinction made between a software developer and a software engineer. While a software engineer is eligible for TN status, a software developer is not. Although my degree is in engineering, realistically I do not believe i am capable of true ""software engineering"", just writing code basically. Are you saying that I need to apply to jobs with a title like ""Software engineer"" rather than ""Full stack developer""? Or that regardless of the job title in job postings, it is common for employers to basically fudge the application to represent your job as an ""engineering"" role, even if in reality it is more of a developer role so that you are TN eligible?

edit: see https://chanian.com/2010/08/01/tutorial-moving-from-canada-to-america-as-a-software-developer/"
"When you refer to those set of beliefs, what specifically are you taking about?

I do not hate women or Chads or normies, and I don't blame them for any of my problems (I only blame myself). I've been to the incel subreddit before and I was disgusted by a lot of the rhetoric there.

I do, however, acknowledge the rampant lookism in our species and the fact that humans are extremely shallow. I also acknowledge that women have it significantly easier when it comes to dating specifically, and that physically attractive people regardless of gender typically live a far better life than ugly people.

Maybe that's part of the incel belief system, but it's all based on scientific studies I have observed. I've asked people to provide me with any contradictory studies and no one has been able to."
Yeah that was kind of me in first year and cuz I live at home it was even harder to make close friends. It definitely takes some getting used to because in high school you are accustomed to meeting a bunch of your friends every single day at lunch which might not be the case in uni especially if u r off campus. Im in 2A and ive recently met a few people that ive really hit it off with. I know people say that you should join clubs to make friends but honestly barely anyone even shows up to most club meetings and they only happen like twice a month. Your best bet is to make friends in class. You said you stopped going to class after 2 weeks. Thats like 4-6 classes fam you wont make friends that fast. We are halfway through the term but im still constantly meeting new people in my classes.
"thanks for the advice but tbh im kinda just a lame-wad who doesn't put that much thought into my job applications lol

also, this recruiter wasn't asking me screening questions or anything like that, they literally just contacted me and asked if i wanted an interview, then helped me arrange a time. A few days after my first interview I got a response saying they'd like to invite me onsite for another one, and blah blah blah. So anyway I didn't really have to throw in buzzwords or bend the truth at all


&gt; If the wage and the company are good enough for you (ie you're desperate, many people are)

:( I mean first of all, I'm just looking for enough to pay rent and tuition, but if I did actually get this job it would pay about 1.5x my last position (with which I was able to pay rent and tuition). It is a pretty well-known company. Now instead I'm probably gonna have to settle for something paying half that lol (lemme know if you're hiring)

&gt; lie lie lie lie lie lie lie (or as I like to encourage, imagine imagine imagine imagine)

"CAPS is pretty new (as in this term new) and admittedly I would say that publicity is lacking. [This page on the Feds website](https://feds.ca/feds-services/centre-academic-policy-support-caps) does give more details than the Facebook page though. CAPS does focus more on academic issues and while some Co-op complaints are academic in nature, many are much broader than that and there is no specific section for Co-op/CECA on that webpage. I'll definitely bring that up with Marketing because I'd agree that it's a bit of a deficiency.  

In terms of anonymity, nothing about your case would be shared outside of the VP-ED's department unless you consent to it (emails have to come from your UW email so ultimately that makes it hard to be truly anonymous) but we would never go to the University on your behalf unless you wanted to.    

For Feds' official policy on the lack of an Ombudsman at the University, [Policy 46](https://feds.ca/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/sc_policies_september_2018.docx.pdf) states that ""the Federation of Students calls upon the University of Waterloo to establish an ombudsman’s office"". So yes, this is under the purview of Feds Advocacy and something that we have policy on. As for if it's an active advocacy ask at the moment....not sure, but I can inquire on that."

"I feel the same way. I've tried really hard and pushed outside of my comfort zone so many times, but it's never really led to any close friendships. A couple friends I did make ended up transferring to different universities.  It's given me pretty bad anxiety as well.

"If you’re only struggling in one course just work your ass off after the midterm. I failed loads of midterms during my degree, just gotta recover. Find someone doing well in the class and be their friend. 1A doesn’t have anything that’s unachievable with increased studying time. "
"Keep moving and try new stuff. I get ups and downs still but idk I think I overall am okay with them. Someone on this sub told me a year or two ago to change something, it hit me hard. I've been changing a lot of things I do in my life lately, it helps, alot. Hope it works for you too."

"You must carry a full course load in engineering, unless you have a reduced course load exemption, in which case you take 1 less than full. You are not allowed to take any required courses on a non study term. Courses are also offered only on study terms so... no, you can't do this. =)"
"You should definitely talk to an advisor ASAP if you're planning on withdrawing this term and coming back next year. There's a lot to sort out - i.e. residence, tuition refunds, OSAP/scholarships, academics, etc. so you'll likely need to jump through a fair bit of administrative hoops."

"I absolutely support efforts to improve the situation of women in physics and her winning the prize is a step-forward. Both Jocelyn Bell and Chien-Shiung Wu had work that was deserving of a Nobel Prize that the Nobel committee failed to acknowledge, so to see Strickland win it for work she did as a PhD student is a step in the right direction. Sadly, given the level of discourse when it comes to gender politics in science, especially physics, I believe people will see this prize as for her gender and not for the brilliant work she did. "
"I believe we have SE counterparts to all the CS courses. I don't know how different they are though, I'm not there yet :)

I can only speak to first year and 2A courses.

In all of the math courses (except 135), profs handwave harder than I have to handwave to get the backdoor of the GRT to open. Even some ECE and SE courses are guilty of this. I think it also depends on the prof to a certain extent.

I'm not necessarily saying handwaving is a bad thing though. It's just something you should keep in mind when choosing between CS and SE."

"First year mechanical huh?

Quick question for you, do you have any goals right now? Could be small or big. Maybe you want to get good grades your first term to make your parents proud? Perhaps you want to work towards getting that sick Tesla co-op by your 3rd year?

Think about what your goals are, and use them to motivate you. I didn't get through the first 3 years of my program by thinking about how sick a 75 would look on my transcript. I got through them by thinking about *why* I was sitting in DP library until 2AM studying for a midterm, *why* I was bashing my head into my laptop trying to make a traffic intersection 'fair' in CS350. This isn't about me so I won't expand on my large overarching goals but it's a healthy thing to have in the back of your mind, it'll give you all the motivation you need.

This strategy may not work for everyone but in my experience this kind of motivation is what will keep you going. It's a grind, and engineering is no joke, but you just have to keep going. Make sure to grab a drink somewhere in there."

Try making up for it by getting the 5% clicker marks and working extra hard for the exam - which is relatively the same level of difficulty as the midterm. Our class average last fall for the final was in the 70's so attaining a decent mark is definitely doable if you put in the effort.
What are your specific symptoms? In most cases it is not as serious as you think. If your sure you've got an issue you really have to aggressively push it to see a specialist. These people will put up a million roadblocks if you let them. I've been in and out of hospitals several times.
"You have to attempt the question. If you guess and get the right answer but don’t put any sort of work, then you won’t get the mark. They’re not gonna nit pick your work because it’s multiple choice, so even if your work is wrong but the answer is right then you should be fine. "
this isnt far reached because i have seen it occurred but are you really attracted to men? you could maybe like girls. think as to why you want a boyfriend. maybe if you are heterosexual finding why you want a boyfriend and seeing what doesnt align in real life with this want might help
"Don’t worry so much about struggling or how much harder it is for you than other person X, etc. When you finish the course, it won’t matter so much. You also have to accept that it’s okay to fail, and that there’s always a way to pick up and move forward from where you are. Reevaluate your studying/learning method, and your goals and priorities for this term. You’ll feel better and more motivated with a concrete plan in mind, however hard it may be.

I don’t know how late you plan on staying up but I can possibly help with A3"
"That's right, it's common for a guy to be interested in a girl but not ask her out due to not knowing if she'd say yes. This is why if you want a guy to ask you out, it's crucial that you make it super obvious. Flirting is one thing but usually not strong enough of a hint, as I'm sure you know from experience. Like I said, you literally cannot be too obvious.

If the guy doesn't respond to your most obvious signs, either he doesn't like you (in that way) or he doesn't have any balls. Either way you should probably move on.

Best of luck."
"python is so ez especially if ur in cs, once you start picking up languages from your other classes the skills will easily transfer over to others so dw, cs 116 would be torture for a cs major b/c of the amount of basic concepts revisited for a course that is to be taken after cs115 for ex what is a var, loop, list/array. When I was in cs116 I didn’t go to a single class and used highschool  level knowledge to do the assignments. I think there was only one assignment that had me stuck, I wish I took 135-136 so for your sake just do tht"
"Cool! I found CHINA101R pretty easy as somebody who went in knowing almost no Chinese. I wish they focused a little less on writing and a little more on the speaking but that's just me. Otherwise it was a great course! I was in immersion for 9 years (grades 1-9) but it wasn't very useful to know anything other than English in my hometown so I got bored and stopped. Kinda wish I didn't. Next term! :)

Elegant way of putting it!

I think the Nano eng kids have class starting 8:30 so I think then. Gotta get up pretty early to catch the piano so I usually just go late haha ��

That's really cool! How'd you learn French &amp; Ukrainian? Im in the same boat, just English and a little bit of french then 1 intro course in Russian and Mandarin so basically not at all it's more of an interest. "

""Although a tenant has the right to privacy, under Ontario law, a tenant is not allowed to change the locks without the consent of the landlord. However, a landlord may change the locks as long as the tenant is provided with new keys.

If the tenant wants the locks changed because of safety and security concerns the tenant should write a letter to the landlord stating all their concerns. A practical solution may be to get permission to change the locks or to install an additional lock and provide the landlord with a key.""


http://www.paigeproperty.com/faq.html

""LOCKS OF ANY KIND on bedroom doors are PROHIBITED and Landlords have 
restrictions, due to insurance policies, which prohibit them from being installed. 
They also pose a fire hazard should individuals need to escape a home in a 
hurry. Each year Landlords replace numerous doors, door frames, lock sets, 
handles and door jams because students forget their keys and break down 
their doors. During monthly inspections, any unauthorized locks on doors will 
be asked to be removed and repairs made to doors and jams at tenants expense. 
If you are worried about theft please exercise due diligence in whom you allow in
to your home, and secure all valuables in a safe place."""
"I remember each time a friend mentions some people can't tell he is brown theres a huge grin on their face that makes em look like they won the lottery.

Stereotypes/beauty standards have basically painted the image of looking like an indian to be a bad thing for guys. It probably has the worst connotation in terms of beauty since brown guys are the worst portrayed people in western media. They are either socially awkward nerds (think Raj from big bang theory), a cornershop owner/taxi driver, or ridiculed for being from someone like in /r/indianpeoplefacebook . By trying to NOT look brown, we distance ourselves from these connotations. The people that have huge brown circles usually don't sweat this too much. This is also another reason why beards are so in fashion now for brown guys as that doesn't fit the stereotypical look.

Asians have gone through a similar thing in the past. It isn't half as bad though and they can't pull off looking like any other race. In the past tattoos/streetwear were the main ways a lot of people who didn't fit the asian mold distanced themselves. A dragon tattoo on an asian guy will shatter any preconceptions of being a nerd.

There is also some animosity towards FOB indians since indirectly a lot of the guys who were raised here think they are furthering the stereotypes + lowkey look down on them. I will admit this is kind of fucked up tho usually most international students at waterloo from india are cool. I've only seen people really start roasting FOB indians from coop terms where the companies get FOB H1Bs."

"I can't. Here's my supposition:

You can hang out and be friends and be affectionate without being romantic so I don't really see a problem there lol. Like just do the things you're both comfortable with. There's a difference between doing things together and actually getting into the mindset of being a romantic relationship because then suddenly there's a boatload more responsibilities and its understandable someone might not want to deal with them.

"&gt;It completely ignores the fact that you can change someone’s life by having sex with them

I did say safe sex (i.e. there's sufficient protection)

&gt;It neglects the chemicals in the brain that are associated with the act.

It's not the only thing that does. My point is sex isn't special and I gave you an example that is more damaging emotionally. But more importantly, the particular situations don't matter. 

&gt;It’s called being responsible with your sexual activity. Have fun safe sex all you want, but safe sex entails communication.

You just defined what responsible means based on how you feel about it. I'm not trying to define what's responsible here. But if you don't communicate what you are expecting, don't expect the other person to do whatever it is you're expecting.

If you're having sex and the guy doesn't mind just stopping at sex and you don't, you have to figure that out and stop it if you don't want to. If you agree with someone to do A, you can only know they want to do A, you can't expect them to want to do B too"

"&gt;If we don't allow people to advocate for killing all jews on public platforms

Leftists call literally anyone who makes an appeal to heritage and family a Nazi, because the left incorrectly believes that exclusivity is evil. A certain amount of exclusivity is essential to form a forward-moving, growing, and close knit group. The lefts entire philosophy rests on the assumption that people are readily interchangeable, inherently equal, and that people in the past were somehow worse than we are; thus the left is obligated to fiercely oppose anything that resembles an ordered structure which assumes that we are as depraved as we have always been and thus views heritage as an ongoing story of how to best restrain our depravity.

I have no desire to associate with people who support the Holocaust aspect of the Nazi conquest, and find it distasteful when people admire the expansionist tendencies of Nazism. However, assuming that exclusivity is evil because of what Nazi's did is a fallacy. The Nazi's biggest problem is that they were insecure in their own position and thus felt the need to destroy another group in order to validate themselves. Those who find this aspect of Nazism appealing are probably insecure, as are those who find any element of exclusivity (i.e. commitment) to be appalling. "
"1.	divide-and-conquer your workload - i noticed from the beginning that the little cliques that form in your cohort tend to stick together and make it through together in the long run because of how they are able to divide the workload, and later on share and explain their work to one another. i find this strategy extremely effective, and really haven’t struggled with the workload since i started taking part in this strategy in my 1B term, so astonishingly my 2A term was among one of my easiest terms in ece, which is typically the term with the heaviest workload and. so it’ll be in your best interest to find some friends.
2.	i have to stress the importance of labs even though i hate how lab content is usually weeks behind lecture content. i consider lab grades as a freebie, especially with all the collaboration involved, you should be able to find an ample amount of help if needed, and if you’re lucky, upper year students’ labs as an “aid” for your own labs.
3.	this is my personal rule, idk how others feel about it but it helps tremendously with my time management - don’t go to tutorials unless your prof is in charge of it (shout out to conrad hewitt for getting me to come back to campus in the evenings) or for the obvious reason of having a quiz. otherwise, skip it. in my 2A term, including tutorial hours, i had 34 hours of class a week. by skipping all but 1 tutorial session a week, i brought it down to about 27 hours, and then lab hours would vary each week, but the few extra hours were a blessing that would help me catch up on sleep, assignments, or even just personal shit like going to the gym.
4.	maintain your physical health, please don’t neglect it. i try to go to the gym 5 days a week, and every night before i go to bed. try to eat healthy as much as possible. nourish your body and supply it with as much nutrients and vitamins as you can. i’m not telling you to become a professional bodybuilder or anything, just try to maintain your physical health. it keeps me sane, and it makes me feel good. get at least 6 hours of sleep. i know you should be getting more than that, but aim for a minimum of 6 hours. sleep is so important, you should know this.
5.	enjoy a friday/saturday night. be productive during the day but go out for food with friends or have a night to yourself. take a break.

if i missed anything feel free to add to this list, i’m at work rn and i’m adding whatever i thought was the most important but i’m sure to have missed something. again, if you have any more questions, feel free to PM me. best of luck!"

"I literally just got the email to schedule for interviews.. They asked for my availability for the next 30 days. On their Q&amp;A page, they quote 4-8 weeks from interview to decision. Looks like we might have to decide between waiting for decision or taking a match from waterlooworks :/ "

"I think they don't get that the companies don't care about ""how it works in your school"". If they think that UofT is a more research and academia based school thus it's unfair to judge candidates from work experience, they should probably apply for grad school instead of looking for jobs."

"I'm being edgy here, but black people also have significantly lower IQ (Confirmed by the APA), which is strongly correlated with income, criminality, socioeconomic status and lifespan (you can check Wikipedia which has the sources) and highly heritable into adulthood. Interventional programs like Head Start costs 10k+ per pupil per year and the effect wears off long before the kids becomes an adult. Should we focus on embryo selection technology on IQ, which is already sort of possible commercially here? https://genomicprediction.com/epgt/"
"Idk why people are saying 1.5k gets you nothing. I have been to SF a couple of times and never spent more than 1.5k for housing until this term(personal choice). North Beach, Noe Valley, Fillmore/Lower Pac heights all have places where you can rent a bedroom for less than 1.5k. Sunset has even more options but the commute may be worse since Muni sucks. Excelsior is also viable and its on the Bart lines for a shorter commute. A good strat is to go on Airbnb, find something and try to get them to rent to you off of Airbnb for a better price."
"Interesting that you should ask... it's quite the opposite.

Society Presidents (or their designates) were for years non-voting members of Council, but few if any ever attended... hard to imagine why not if you can't vote and can't be removed because you're *ex officio*. Note: Obviously this doesn't speak to the competency of Society Presidents individually, just that of their work on Council.

So Council supported a bylaw amendment reform package back in Winter 2017 (quorum was lost so then again in Fall 2017) to give them voting rights. "

 Waterloo has lost a couple very close games to Guelph in the last two years, so they’ll definitely be  looking for revenge next weekend. 

If the last two regular-season games are any indication, this should be one hell of a match  next week."
"ehhh SPCOM223 in my opinion is far from being related to social skills. There were a bunch of people in my class that were weird during one-on-one interactions but seemed normal during speeches. All that class does is maybe improve your public speaking skills, but that's not social skills."

i know local can't affect the federal yet i need to make sure you have the right view for you to move on to next level. because eventually you might move to a place that can influence more laws in you later career. also if enough of local government join you can hold feds' feet onto fire. 
"is there anyone who failed ECE105 (the midterm at least) and still managed to pass first year? I'm been studying only physics this entire week, went to the prof's extra help sessions, office hours, and the WEEF review session, and I still can't do any of the past/practice midterm questions"
personally i would not recommend being a cashier as your career however min wage in Alberta is already $15/hr. Housing cost is much cheaper than GTA and is prolly on par with KW. Tax is 5%. If you like the great outdoors you can probably get seasonal jobs in the provincial/national parks. 
"this would be a funny joke if i had more faith in uwaterloo. but i don't.

"From my perspective, it feels like the university is *saying* they're doing a lot of things but it doesn't necessarily feel like the actions taken are changing very much. I've been on the wait list for a psychological assessment for over four months now. I was told I was third on the list one month ago and still have not been contacted. They have allegedly hired many additional psychologists, but how has it taken over a month for ""third on the list"" to not be moved any higher up? It's frustrating, I wish there was at least more transparency"
"Wow thank you for this. I needed it. 

I thought I was the only who would need to stay up late to study for quizzes and will need to for midterms. Everyone is so smart they get the content right away and can do other things like party while I'm sitting there trying to understand *something*. 

Btw, is it common for people to stay up until like 2am to study for tests or is it only the ""dumb"" people. 

I'd say CS is harder because I've looked at code before and none of it seems to be written English (like it's English but was words like Void)"
"&gt; And there really aren't replacements for bomber, at least not with the same vibe.

There aren't many places with the ""same vibe"" as RCH 101, yet I'm not seeing any complaints about no longer having lectures there. 

The argument to keep the bomber is subjective at best (it has a unique vibe unlike the other bars and for some reason that means we must keep it), and there are clear, objective benefits against keeping it (ie leasing it will generate profit and save people money)

&gt; I don't play or watch football, and our football team sucks. Lets get rid of that too, and make a better use of the field!

"Posts critical of UW's Counselling Services management always get heavily downvoted. I take it to mean that UW management are invested in minimizing when issues with their management are expressed publicly.

&gt;Notice there's almost no one in this thread? 

Most folks here lurk. Especially on serious topics. I'd say less than one in a thousand actually comment. They'll read though.

&gt; No one cares.

Wow you're really are pushing that line. Sorry that it isn't true. Repeating it won't make people go. More people care more and more. Sorry.

&gt;My ""strong negative emotions"" are directed at the fact that people think it's some sort of national crisis when a woman gets her ass touched.

It's part of a UW crisis. Our campus mental health services suffer from this. Our campus women's safety suffers because of David Mackay, the man who sexually attacked two CS psychologists, being promoted into management at Counselling Services.

David Mackay had two psychologist victims, not just one. His attack on Dr Winter was much more severe. Why minimize?"
"Good question -- and I know it's an issue that comes up frequently on this subreddit.

On unfinished buildings, I know folks can't concentrate on academics when they're worried about when their housing is going to be ready. While the city doesn't have oversight over private construction timelines, we have made our building inspectors available after hours including on holidays so that we aren't part of the delay. I also pushed us to post these inspection results online as we get them -- our occupancy tracker ([https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/Multi-unit-Construction.asp](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/Multi-unit-Construction.asp)) is there so students and the media doesn't have to take a builder's word for it that they're ready for occupancy.

On other practices, I'm hopeful that the standard lease introduced by the province earlier this year can help tenants better understand their rights and responsibilities ([http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page18704.aspx](http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page18704.aspx)). A lot of the shadier practices are called out on this form so that both sides know who does what and how far that goes. The Mayor and I worked with the previous FEDS and WLUSU exec to push the province on this and found some success. 

While we don't have authority over many landlord-tenant matters, as that is the provincial Landlord Tenant Board, we do have a role to play in education about who to call for what issue. I've raised this at our Town and Gown committee (a joint universities-students-city-residents committee), and I'm expecting to see working on this in the 2019 Business Plans for the Municipal Enforcement division. I will be looking for our staff to work with your FEDS exec and municipal affairs commissioner to help us get the right information out there in a way that works for students."

"First of all, it is an academic offence to post a quiz.

Secondly, the professor has not said whether this quiz is for participation or not. Even if it isn't , I think that this case would easily be able to turned into participation marks through a grievance report.

People in this class posted rude comments about the professor online and are rude to the TAs for this course. The amount of toxicity and immaturity demonstrated by biochem and chem students is disgusting and inexcusable no matter the circumstances. This situation has an easy remedy in talking to the professor, but instead people become immediately toxic and rude.

"Gives a chance for your credit score to ""recover"" from the initial hit it took when you applied for the card. Also it looks bad if there are multiple hard credit checks within a short period of time. 6 months is the generally accepted amount of time between credit card applications for those who like to ""churn"" cards.

If you wait for about 6 months, your score will have ""recovered"" and you have a higher probability of being approved and might be able to get a higher credit limit. It would also help with your application if you had employment income.

If you're interested in seeing what your credit report looks like, there's a certain website that lets you see your Transunion credit report; they also give you their version of your credit score using their formula (which is pretty accurate).

"Honestly at this point it sounds like you might need professional help regarding more deep rooted problems

But unfortunately simply meeting people isn't the whole process. You need to actively reach out to people, and sometimes force your way into well-established friends groups. 

What are your interests or hobbies? That's certainly a place to start. What about the friend you mentioned that you met at Oweek? Does he or she have any mutual friends you could do something with? 

Or think about  this, when meet a new person: do you ask them what they are interested in or try to talk to them about what they've done recently? Do you ask them to introduce you to their friends, or for their contact information? Ask them if they have any plans?

Honestly, I don't know how to help, but best of luck."
"That's not quite true. I mean you could argue eating, drinking water, and surviving are just as important or more important from an evolutionary perspective. Can't procreate if you're dead. And you could say that working and making money is an extension of trying to survive.

And idk about the playboy lifestyle, it sounds nice in the short term, but maybe I'm just an old man now, but I'd rather have a gf and be in a healthy relationship than be a playboy. I think finding a suitable partner is a far more meaningful pursuit."
"DropBike won a region-wide RFP for a bike share pilot, which should start next year ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/dropbike-bikeshare-waterloo-region-1.4636575](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/dropbike-bikeshare-waterloo-region-1.4636575)). 

I was happy to approve our portion of this contract permitting them to responsibly use city property for havens -- I'm hopeful this will help more people make the choice to cycle rather than drive. After the pilot, I hope we'll see a region-wide RFP issued for a permanent bike share program. Whether dockless solutions work well or cause issues is one of the things I'm interested in as I understand dockless has not worked well in some places. 

The Lime e-scooter project just started, so it's too early to pass judgment on how it's going. 

The idea came out of the R&amp;T Park, and the city was happy to facilitate a pilot project on a limited zone (there are Highway Traffic Act issues, so I believe only private land and multi-use trails are permitted - the University of Waterloo has not yet opted in). Apparently the non-compliance rate of staying in the pilot zone has been about 10% so far. I understand Lime is turning on more of its tools to try and limit that non-compliance.

"Sometimes 2 people are really talkative and get along well. I've met girls who wouldn't stop messaging me and I thought there was something more, but... nope, they were just bored and wanted someone to spam.

I would say that in the average case, this is abnormal and even if it's not full blown love or something, it is weird for them to message each other consistently. Personally speaking, I would purposely delay responses to not set off any flags inadvertently if I find someone I just met messaging me a lot.

As others have posted, it is up to what you can tolerate. Personally, I find it annoying when my gf constantly messages a guy she just met on her phone and ignores me in real life (well, actually, I find it annoying if anyone messages anyone else frequently or plays with their electronics while in my company, but it's extra annoying when it's a SO, close friend, or family member like holy shit go play by yourself if you don't value my time). 

I also agree with others that questionable things that sound flirty with a member of the opposite sex like ""aww cute &lt;3"" or random hearts goes beyond what I'm comfortable with. 

At the end of the day, though, it's your SO and what you are comfortable with. Yes, it can be frustrating when your SO isn't good with boundaries when talking to people and sometimes leaves the wrong impression. Yes, you can talk to them, and they can try to fix the issue but it's probably never going to be completely alleviated because they don't (and won't) see it as an issue. 

All in all, if they were going to cheat, being like ""don't cheat"" and having them respond with ""OK"" is not going to change anything. We can't read other people's minds and stalk them 24/7 so it comes down to how much you trust that your SO wants to be with you more than anyone else in this world."

"I hear it’s a problem from a lot of students on University. I don’t experience it like they do obviously, but King street (where I live) is terrible. I’m able-bodied but what if I was disabled or with a stroller or whatever. Waterloo is really bad about maintaining access to sidewalks "
"I kinda think it's dumb you can't smoke on res. Should be that you can't smoke inside. You can smoke on the streets, so I guess if you're at UWP walk 20 metres to a main street and smoke up if you care about the rules. Not that anyone who smokes a lot is going to follow these rules anyways. "
I think one solution is that the rental fee should be tied to rent so that affordable units stay affordable. We already overdid it on the 5 bedroom one kitchen type units. So many of them are empty right now— I’d incentivize landlords using them to house low income and refugee families. 
"I'm actually in the same boat, I left for a year, and I will now be doing my 5th co-op when the rest of my class is doing their fourth. When their 6th co-op comes around (and I would be doing my 7th), do I get access to WaterlooWorks? Do employers still get the tax deduction if they hire me?"
If you're a student there's a little hill North of campus by CIF. It's alright and easy. McLennan Park is already mentioned and the best place. There's Chicopee tubing which is fun. Otherwise there's not too many options. Waterloo is pretty flat. I still might be missing some places however.
"Not much experience with SF but I've heard public transit there is lacking. 

It's easily possible to live outside NYC to save $ but still within easy commute without car. 

Harrison NJ should be under 1300/mo if you hunt, and is 20 minutes away from downtown via PATH to World Trade Center. "
Orientation is one of the few times I’ve felt any sense of school spirit between different programs and faculties (both as a first year and as a orientation leader). Shortening it would really disservice any incoming students who could benefit from the events before school actually begins

"Your example is invalid, math majors are typically students what I describe. It is different than engineering which covers a spectrum of majors, like I said, most people in the faculty of math correspond to what other schools define as stat majors or cs majors under the faculty of science.  "
uhhhh that's probably just because there's way more tech internships in general vs other fields? And those companies want to post on ww because they know we can pump out code monkeys. Unless you know of a ton of good internships out there that would post on ww if only CECA would badger them?

"Bullshit. I totally disagree. If you care about that grade then grow a pair and go fight for it. Everytime I went to a TA or prof they always increased my grade because I actually showed the initiative to ask for a review. You dont need to be an asshole about it. Be respectful and point out the areas you feel you deserve better in. Justify your argument. Im not saying your going to turn a 60 into an 85, but you could gain 5-10%. If your GPA doesn't matter then so be it, but I personally need every mark I can get to maintain the grades I need."
"I enjoy math/cs classes a lot more then business which I felt was too hand wavy at least up until 2a. I have a lot more freedom to take whatever I want and group projects aren't really my thing - there's a lot of them in business. I also have an extra coop term and 2 fewer study terms which is a big plus financially.

The one thing I do miss is having a semi cohort taking all my classes with me which occasionally bites me since all the friends I've made since dropping aren't in math or cs and I end up grinding through all my courses by myself"
I finished an hour early and got 970 (99%) so I'd say that Princeton Review served me well. I think Princeton Review covered everything necessary. It seems like a lot of people struggled with time management but fortunately I have the (usually useless) skill of finishing exams quickly. tbh if you're from waterloo and are in pure math then you've probably seen everything in gre except differential equations. Also if you can't finish everything in time that's most likely fine since anything above 800 is probably good enough to get you anywhere.
"I think they’re only good if you have extremely short hair and even a barber with 1 year of experience can’t fuck up. 

My friend brought a photo with him, not even a complicated cut, he even had it done other places and they straight up said they can’t do that. And they just gave him this really short buzzcut. 

I went once, as soon as i sat down, the barber asked me either number2 or number3. 

it seemed like everyone walking out of there had a buzzcut. 

Also i feel like whole atmosphere there was  pretty rude, (not to me especially)"

"I graduated last year so I don't know if things changed, but a few things I observed:

1. CS (and math) advisors have an ungodly long line during the beginning of the term. I remember I had to wait from 2pm (beginning of office hour) all the way to 4 for a course override. In the end I was told the advising hours are over so I've waited for nothing. I'm guessing other popular programs might have the same problem as well.
1. CS again. Some advisors knows nothing about the courses (usually the sessional instructors) beyond the course numbers and in the end can offer no advice. 
1. Other than that, when they are not busy and real profs, they are very helpful and I have nothing to complain. The pmath advisors were especially nice, who explained what each course was about and triggered my interest."
"I'm looking forward to a younger councilor who can represent the students and other young adults in this city, but sadly Beisan is not the one. 

Watching the [debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUyd0YWkzrQ) , she does not seem very well versed with the political issues. For example, she said she's going to bring the GO train here a few years quicker, okay, but how? And frankly the consistent reminder/flexing that she 'worked in Ottawa' on the debate and in this Reddit post comes off as ""I'm better than the others"". 

By the way, here are [all the positions you are voting for](https://waterlooregionvotes.org/wards/Waterloo-Ward-06) on Monday: City Councillor, Mayor, Regional Chair, and school board members in addition to Regional councillor (which is the position beisan is running for).

"Problems based on application of concepts covered in class.
IMO, [this](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) is a great example of amazing problem sets.

For example, one of the lectures covered bsts balancing + bst augmentation, and then the assignment gave you a slow line sweep algorithm and asked you to make it better.(Had to use an OS tree).

EDIT: It was problem 3-2 [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/MIT6_006F11_ps3.pdf). The way it's written alone makes it very interesting.

EDIT2: I think giving students a real world problem they can solve using concepts which they have learnt in class is important."

"I used to consistently carpool with someone who worked there full-time and he described their tech stack as modern and their work culture having (some?) overtime.

If you’re not satisfied with the pay, you could always use the co-op term as a stepping stone for higher paying opportunities. "
I'm assuming majority of the content in the first midterm is counting technique? I struggled so much with counting techniques lol but ended up doing pretty decent overall. You may or may not find other chapters easier so don't give up and push through I guess is the only advice I can give you
"It's hard to change old habits. If money can buy you happiness, then it's worth it, as that's the easiest happiness you'll find in life. Budget a certain amount to blow on stuff and make sure you blow it. You'll soon be hard to a higher cost of living. It's hard to bring it back down, though."

"if im remembering correctly, here's about how long each of the courses took me on average per assignment:

135: 5 ~ 10hrs

136: about 10 hrs

245: about 5 hrs

246: about 25 hrs (due date 1 + due date 2 including the group project aka A5)

240: about 8 hrs

241: about 10 hrs

251: about 3 hrs"
"Resumes are highly subjective. Ask two different employers about what they want in a resume and you will likely find significant differences in opinion on what they want to see on a resume. In fact, ask two different hiring managers in the same company and they will often directly contradict each other on certain resume preferences. If someone here posted their advice on an ""ideal resume"", it would likely get shit all over by other students in no time flat. Resumes are a very personal thing, both from an application and a hiring perepective. 
"
"Thank you, really appreciate that.

I've been working on a more permanent way for the higher quality writing here to organized and archived. I'm gonna really step into gear during my co-op term working on this thing more regularly. And I think this thing, even though it may be a sort of niche thing, will hopefully be very very enjoyable and funny, although jarring (see subculture.com), to a small group of people.

It will probably be shit and worthless, but on the off chance that it's not.... well we'll see, for now I just need to write more.

"The course itself isn't very difficult, I took it online and as long as you read through the text and take decent notes on conducting a CBA you should be fine. Rahman is a decent prof, I had her for ECON 302 and she has detailed notes and good slideshows, but I found it hard to pay attention because her presentation style is a bit dry.

Like most courses, read the textbook and course notes and ask lots of questions and you'll do fine. If you don't understand something, ask about it - you are probably not the only one who doesn't understand it."
"shut the fuck up. Lmao theres literally ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO standardized testing in Ontario, whatever the fuck happens in one HS can be and probably is completely fucking different than the next. No shit that people who have 100's are going to good, but once you get past a certian threshold around 90-95 it honestly dosent matter.

Thats where lying on AIF comes in. You can balance fucking bullshit grade differences across schools by boosting and lying on your AIF.

And also, give the guy a fucking break. If he works hard he can get past 2A CS."
"Hmm I'll read up on the hentai stuff later. There's a difference between ""fetishsizing [individual] Japanese women"" and ""fetishsizing Japanese women [as a race]"" and like I am unsure which one it's suppose to be lol

If both parties are consenting to engage in the physical manifestation of a fetish, there's no issue lol. 
Like, you can have your thing for Asian women or whatever and it's fine. But if you go outside and start trying to hit on Asian women and being like ""Oh bby I want you to be my Asian gf"", aka involving them in your fetish without their consent to be in it, is when you're gunna get people calling our your behavior. 

(I have no idea if this makes sense rn I'm trying to read math and my english ability has completely deteriorated because I can only do 1 thing at a time properly)"
"I'm not sure if the company is entirely as representative of what this HR person is saying (mid-tier, well-known canadian), but some of the comments are out of this world. This company can clearly choose from a strong applicant pool. Meanwhile, the logic for some of these comments is literally ""no good UofT applicants? Must be a shit company. Strong UofT students are too good to apply to your company anyways""

And this comment:

&gt;  I think the problem comes from the way that your HR team thinks rather than U of T students. I don't think you understand the capabilities of a U of T CS student. U of T is by far the most difficult school in Canada and the pressure that a student goes through in a given year is far greater than you think. Even if a student at U of T hasn't had much work experience, on average they're more capable than a kid at any other university in Canada because of the pressure they undergo in a given year.

Are you not on reddit? The front page and the comments on the front page posts are CONSTANTLY full of pop culture references. You can probably learn everything there is to learn about certain things like Star Wars or Avengers without even watching the movies but just seeing the posts about em.
"Get your dad to a hospital. 

Something very similar happened to my dad many years ago. Turns out my dad had a TIA (i.e. a stroke that lasts for about 20 minutes, then goes away).

We went to the hospital immediately afterwards - they said if we came even later, it could have been much worse. "
"Honestly, I feel like most people would probably find engineering to be more similar to what they are used to from high school, but with longer hours.

The job prospects are basically the exact same for CS and SE though. Just apply for both and choose whichever one you think you'll enjoy more."
"I think because of the fact you spend four months at a time here, it’s not that bad. Compared to the gta, it is a step down but there are things/places to explore in the kw area when you do have free time. It’s also only about an hour plus a bit more from gta so it’s honestly not too far"
"It does seem rather useless that you have to compare universities as a whole, instead of any additional level of granularity. Of course when it comes to reputation the university as a whole matters, but it seems like the combination of university and area of focus would be more more important."
"It's still really rude to brag about your (father's) money. I'm no homeless person myself but I don't brag about it. Perhaps it's acceptable in Dubai, but not here.

And the sweat shop thing was my assumption you're a rich Chinese fob, but you wouldn't speak English so well in that case ��"
Its really insensitive to call someone who’s suffering miserable. It’s also rude to assume anyone that would be in a similar relationship was miserable to begin with. It doesn’t work that way and the dynamics are very complicated. You shouldn’t go around judging and labelling everyone 
"SE has to take SE 212, which is also Logic and Computation. That said, the underlying point is that university isn't a vocational school and not everything you learn at school will be applicable to the workplace (indeed the majority of the content you'll learn will be ""useless"" in that sense)."
"Thank you very much! I really appreciate the kind words. While it is unfortunate that neither of us won, it does not mean that we, or anyone in the community, can't continually contribute to and serve the community and public education. Thanks to everyone for the support and going out to vote!"
They will tell you what to do if the review doesn't help. What courses you can take. When the best times to take them are. If you even need a course or if you can rewrite it later. That kind of stuff. Basically they will tell you your next steps. And I don't think it matters which comes first.
"True, I think a lot of students and even some companies get that CECA complixates the coop-employer relationship but only students complain cuz they pay the fee and companies dont have any complaints bc theyre getting a sweet ~~pool of talent~~ tax credit from hiring coop students.

Good luck!"
Yeah I've heard a lot about squats and deadlifts being most important for legs so I always do those. I've been switching between straight sets 3x8 at 70lbs+the bar and reverse pyramid sets at 90lbs+ the bar. Just feel like I'm doing much fewer exercises on legs compared to other muscle groups.
Yeah like you actually have the evidence to prove that. I dont wanna start some fight here but what Ive seen in China about the foreigners (white black brown) are way worse. They dont just save seats I will tell u that. U cant just judge a group by only a small small small portion of its ppl. 
"i've said this many times but you should be lucky you even get ""hell week"". other faculties constantly have exams with labs/assignments/classes still going on. as for right now you just have to take a deep breath, and e-mail your prof/advisor. chances are they can arrange something. good luck!"
"my guy, there's always hope

the night before my ece140 midterm I had a big fight with my gf - I was so upset I didn't think I got a single question right on the midterm

"You haven’t had jack luck and guys only want sex.

In other words, you’ve had plenty of sex and are waiting for the tall, handsome, rich man to give you a challenge. Either that or you’re saving sex for this kind of man, but I doubt it. Stop pretending as if you can even relate to what a man who looks like you (assuming you’re not attractive from what you said) has to deal with. This kind of man is currently contemplating his motivation to continue school or socialize due to constant rejection while you have 100 options to choose from. "

&gt; Your personal experience is not science, your witnessing people is not science.

@ me when ""scientists"" claim to understand a fucking single thing about the connection between physical neural activity and subjective experience, outside of people's self-reporting. Your understanding of this topic is cringe.

Might want to work on your English first.

In all seriousness though, your chess achievements are pretty impressive. Might want to do some math/programming contests. Maybe start a programming club at your high school (that's what I did)."
"&gt; how could anyone have gotten to 4th yr, particularly in a co-op program, and not managed to develop enough interpersonal and relationship skills that they lack the ability to develop relationships appropriately?

"Ah interesting, I buy a lot of no name stuff. I also make a lot of pasta. But I also like having meat with my dinner meals so even though I buy cheap stuff like sausage it still doubles my cost on those meals. I also eat a lot.

"Confidence is still something you can work on tho!

Some people have better base stats in certain areas. You can have slightly higher base attractiveness as a kid or you could be slightly better at math or whatever, but we're all old enough now that our effort along the way matters quite a bit."
"Exams are so fucking dumb these days. They give you shit to prepare it because they're afraid people won't go as deep in the material.

Results: you can go in depth as much as you want, if you don't already know how to solve a particular problem it will take you time and time is fucking scarce."
"Good chance is just based on anecdotal evidence. If you get the ""we have passed your information along"" email it should mean that you passed the coding challenge.

From there, I think there's a quick review process to see if you're up for an interview. If you did get that email, then good luck!"
Hey liberals don't believe in leaving things alone and actively push legislation that explicitly favors women and nonwhites b/c muh oppression and privilege. What's wrong with conservatives pushing legislation that favors non-progressives b/c muh intellectual diversity and muh bias blindspots? 
"I went to SWC. Yeah many kids I knew were capable of low 90s average at my school as well while participating in clubs and all that. However high 90s is very very rare. Including english. Also Western is up there with churchill as well, a lot of smart students going ham, however still below 95."
"It’s literally just the number range the textbook gives, no reasoning behind the answer, just an arbitrary number out of the book. If you go to the one page in the index with “visible spectrum” that’s what it gives but it doesn’t say anything about approximate or any of that bullshit "
"Not OP, but the way credit scores are calculated, if you request more credit in a short period of time, it looks bad and it will reduce your score. These are considered ""hard"" credit checks because the company you request the new card from will request a credit check that reflects on your score"
"That could be part of it, although I’m not jealous of everyone who’s happy. And when I’ve been my happiest, I would still get jealous (though I would ignore it more easily)

It seems like no matter how happy I am/how much I’ve achieved at one point in time I am still extremely insecure."
"lol I think that “reserve” is just her English tbh. What I heard in class when they’re speaking in Chinese, they said let them sit wherever. For sure, like I can promise this. But you can have your opinion. I’m just trying to state some facts I saw here since I’m not involved in this."
"&gt;Gay people don't really contribute to the long term success of a group over generations, so it is illogical to push for the advancement of this life style. 

Honestly dude go fuck yourself.

You're drawing a false equivalence between a fight for equality and whatever the fuck ""the advancement of \[the LGBT\] life style \[sic\]"" means.  Christianity fundamentally is about loving and respecting your neighbour, yet there is no shortage of people actively committing and/or promoting violence and oppression against LGBT people in the name of god."
"Besides the weather, as has been mentioned, it is a different 'vibe'/atmosphere. Now which one is better is entirely subjective. 

I will mention your ""sweaty tech nerd"" view of the bay area is way off. More ""bro tech nerd""s than ""sweaty tech nerd""s, though the latter is also present. Cost of living is like 30% higher in Bay Area compared to NY.

If you live outside NYC you really need a car (if on Harlem/Hudson line you can do ok), where most the Bay Area is covered by BART. Though if in NYC the transit is way better than anything Bay Area has."
"EAC (the committee that handles academic issues) has potential plans. Let me answer you about that later tonight.

UPDATE: Turns out EAC is not going to be producing a cannabis policy (to respond to the university's one) but another committee or just some individual councillors may produce one. *This would of a different nature than the one that /u/GreenBurette is referring to (which relates to the internal operations of Feds's).* Given the divisiveness that appears to exist among students on this issue, this will probably not be a fast process."
"""That way, even if you were mean to them they’ll likely care about you"". Okay so what Im getting from this is you want to be manipulative to the point of ""making them fall for you"" and being mean to them at the same time.

But why?

If its just sex then I don't see how that will make you ""successful and respected and well liked"". From the things you have described the same outcome would have happened if you were not a dick.

If you want to be well liked or respected, you can just be ""manipulative"", whatever you mean by that and just not be a dick to certain people, would achieve the same outcome while minimizing negative outcomes.

""No one would suspect a thing."" This is assuming a perfect scenario, which may or may not happen, probably leaning towards not. Im sure there are multiple situations where this will not occur, things usually don't play out as smooth as you think.

""Plus they move around a lot so that helps for sure."" What does this help? From what im reading the sociopaths move around? not really sure what you're trying to say here.

"I am one of the witness. Let me give you more real details. Actually he doesn't have friends and he try to reserve the seat to polish the white people which he regarded as “real Canadian “. He continuously talk to these white guys who did not know him which makes them feel so annoying. He tried to use the way of bullying Chinese students showing to Canadians to achieve a sense of belonging which seems so nasty. Also he is so experienced at bullying. When we ask him out gently to have a talk he said you can yell at me I don’t care and he finally go to the corner of the washroom. He tries to pretend he is the victim. Also when the professor pass by, his attitude suddenly changed like begging for our excuse. When she offended the girl Tuesday he said yo watch out near her guy with a nasty tone."
"I skipped a lot during 1B and was skipping a lot during the first part of this term as well. I got some decent rest during the break and now I intend on actively going to class. 

I think skipping is fine if you can motivate yourself to catch up on the information outside of class. Be honest to yourself about this one, since a lot of people (like me) think they can do it, and only some of them (unlike me) can actually pull that off. 

Hewitt's courses IMO are great, I wouldn't skip them unless I had something particularly important to go to. 

Harder is probably one of the more controversial ones but IMO I'll be more productive Redditing in his class while reading his notes than just reading his notes on my own time while spending that class time gaming or something. 

Rodolfo is really helpful in-class with his explanations and he answers questions well, so I'd go to those ones. 

I'm undecided on Trip, but I don't get particularly bored during his lectures so I consider it alright. 

Karim's class is hit or miss, honestly, if you don't enjoy the content in that one, I don't think skipping it will hurt you that much. 

Lan's class is meh. I feel obligated to go to her courses just so I can at least follow along with the notes (trying to decipher them without going to class is even more of a pain). "

∠( ᐛ 」∠)＿ missed opportunity eh
Also not really. Like for ex. I got a 90+ in M135 but im legit struggling with fucking Propositional logic in goddamn PHIL145 which is like extremely basic and much much simpler than what I did in first year. I feel like I just forgot everything I've learned so far including how to learn new shit
"Because you killed them all.... Wtf?!

But seriously there's no way everyone in your class hates you. Are you sure it's not, at least, partly in your head? I tend to do that, I usually assume people don't like me, but I'm often wrong.

And if they don't like you, you can always turn that around!

"Chug a litre of water before you sleep and you'll get up to piss in the morning no matter what. Also, if it's related to SAD (seasonal affective disorder) like my depression is and gets stronger in the winter/fall months, consider taking vitamin D3 to help. Hell, take it anyways, who gives a shit"
Fucking guy makes the cab pull over to buy fucking weed in this shithole?  Even cabbie is like wtf?   Admittedly I just wanna put it inside him but seriously?  This country everything isvillehal enough and he wants to add weed to ?  Fuck me ivdontveben knows where I live.  Better conservevbattery
"I asked some upper years, and they said the final likely won't be significantly harder with this midterm average. Considering you need 60% in this course to take 136, they probably want a class average significantly higher than that so that most of the class is able to move on to the next course."
"I go to a 'good' school, Im enrolled in the IB program at St. Francis Xavier. Its comparable to Glenforest's IB program, in some cases better cuz it offers HL Maths and HL Physics. Does taking these subject help in anyway? 

Is the average going to be 96.5/97 for tron for 2019?

That is scary...."
"I mean you can be nice and still get a friendship if you dont want a fwb. Im sure most people wouldnt mind being friends, so just depends on the ""motive"" &lt;- really bad way to put it but eh. It can be good or mischievous but if you got nothing good to say after, then dont say anything? :Shurgs:"
It's ethically wrong for students to vote in municipal elections. Most of us aren't from this city and we plan on leaving it around the time of the next election anyway. I know I would be pissed off if my hometown's vote was swayed by students who only planned on ever spending 4 or 5 years there.
"It's uncommon but I don't really see a reason not to do it if you don't care about graduating a bit later. 

BUT

You can usually take 4 ""real"" classes and one bird course that only takes an hour or two a week as an elective. Which is a lot more common and what I would personally recommend doing."
"Story related to this:

In my high school, some kids decided to start a fight club across the street from the high school. Just for fun. It got shut down within the first hour by teachers and VPs and multiple kids got suspended.

I wish you the best luck in forming this group, it sounds like fun!"
"To the left you see the engineering goose, always thinking the camera is pointed at him.

In the front you see the arts goose, trying strange fruits that just happened to be lying on the ground.

In the back you see a subspecies of the arts goose, an AFM goose biting another AFM goose in the ass."
listen theres something about professors not giving two shits and fucking with their students that makes me respect them. maybe its from years and years of my father fucking with me and calling me faggot and shit like that but i love that old bastard and i love professors that hate their students
"&gt; My ex-boyfriend smoked it every single day for 2 years

Ok. And how is his life going? Did he stop smoking?

Sounds like my life, more or less. Except my father was dead and I ended up being an alcoholic/stoner myself.

I mean, you do sound like a sheltered person when you bring up smoking weed once a month when I'm clearly talking about habitual use.

PTSD is normally associated with war vets. I wasn't saying you're a war vet, just wondering what you are having PTSD from. I should have guessed pretty easily, given the way the world is today."
"Don't kill my hamsters

Don't eat my allergen-free food unless you buy a replacement before the original package has less than 1 serving left 

Don't use the washroom for more than 15 mins at a time unless you message the group chat first and also leave the door unlocked when you get to the showering part so other people can still pee

Don't use $9999999 of electricity mining bitcoin

Don't bring in bedbugs

There's definitely more but your question's kinda vague so I can't really think of anything lol. What kinda boundaries were you thinking of? "
"I did this in first year. I had a presentation from ENGL 119 at 2pm, but I slept at 9 and I ended up waking at 630pm.

I was shitting my pants but I emailed my prof, told him the truth. I lost a lot of marks, but he allowed me to present my part (it was a group presentation), and he gave my group members a little extra.

Obviously it sucks, but its not the end of the world and regardless of what happens you'll be fine. In the context of your whole academic career, this is not that big of a deal (it does seem like it now, but trust me it isn't). 

"
"I don't think anyone is obligated to debate any of them or provide them a platform for speech. I don't think the government should arrest any of those three that you mentioned. 

But who decides who is a nazi? Frankly, if you talk of killing jews, or eliminating ""inferior"" races/religions/sexual orientations, by whatever means necessary (or at least deportation, killing, refusing to admit any of unconditionally, banning or otherwise therof), I don't think any company, university or otherwise platform with a modicum of self respect would host you. "
" I messed up awfully hard by sending a section of code to my prof with a large series of printf statements in first year. The project that I was coding was not functioning correctly at all despite the 20+ hours of effort I'd put in that entire week. Friends were using quite similar code and yet theirs was passing all the test cases and mine was not. Needless to say I was furious and in my anger I chose to use some rather questionable vocabulary in the printf statements.  


It resulted in a very strongly worded email from my prof about my choice in language and I had to go and apologize profusely about it afterwards once I realized I screwed up in such a dumb manner. Fortunately I didnt get punished because the prof was a great guy, but I made sure to never do something that dumb again after that. "

"A good read is ""How to make friends and influence People"" It's a classic and it's been around for a while. highly recommend it.

Need to emphasize how important it is to make friends because loners tend to get worse mental health as the years go by and do worse academically than people in a group."
"I don't disagree, but what about straight people who decides to sterilize themselves without having any children or provide any support to family members who do and ends up being mediocre? This is much more of an argument for taxing single people a large fixed sum of money for not having kids tbh."
"I try to give about a 15% tip. It's a custom in this country, as far as I'm concerned.

As for hair styles, my personal recommendation is not to be a shitlord and get a fuccboi meme-tier haircut. Take some time to find out an ideal hair cut for your facial shape and hair length/straightness/colour"
Mastering Physics is trash but ezpz. Tutorial problems are where you should learn how to actually solve non-trivial problems. Physics derivations are crucial to understanding what you are doing. You should learn how they work even if they don't show up on assignments or exams if you enjoy physics.

"What do you mean by actually harmful? If you were raised in a culture of extreme homophobia without minimal exposure to LBGTQ tolerance what do you think you would believe? If so doesn't this call into the question of the soundness of your value system, but value systems in general held by people?"
"having a teacher would help but if you can rope in a friend who’s had formal instruction that’s a good enough substitute. start with scales and chords, and maybe try to work your way up rcm levels as a guideline for difficulty level of songs.

if you just want to jam out asap, focus on chords."
"To be fair I’ve done this while also saying they can talk to me. I just honestly don’t feel like I’m qualified to help anyone other than by listening to them vent. I don’t know how to help myself let alone anyone else. 

But also a lot of people say they’re there to listen and then end up not replying. Like idiot don’t get peoples hopes up/bite off more than you can chew, especially when you’re dealing with someone depressed, it makes them trust people even less and become more depressed and hopeless when you fuck them over like that."
"- Not sure about the formatting of having things isolated in the centre of the page. I would shift it over to just be right after the words on the left. For example: ""Bachelor of Computer Science, University of Waterloo)
- ""Authorized to work in the United States without sponsorship"". While this is a good thing to highlight and certainly appealing to American companies, it shouldn't be directly under your name. If you do have a summary of qualifications it should be a list of things you excel at, your specializations, experience, etc.
- For your education instead of writing year 4 and graduatig august 2020 just put the year range of your studies. I.e. 2016-2020. They can extrapolate what year you're in
- Make sure all of your bullet points start with a verb in past tense. For example your first bullet point under work experience is ""leading"" but should be ""led""
- ""Implementation of company's flagship transport.."" How did you do this? Which tools did you use? Which management system was it? What was the end result of it?
- ""Created dynamic MongoDB..."" which languages or frameworks did you use for this?
- You might want to consider adding location to each of your work experience. Can contextualize your work a bit more. For example did you work at head office in NYC or their smallest office in the middle of nowhere?
- ""Reduced project compil time by 70?"".. how did you optimize the project Gradle dependencies? Be specific here
- 1st place at RU Hacks 2017 - your project going viral does not necessarily correlate with the quality of your work or the impressiveness of the applied skills. I would remove the points about views and instead list how many competitors you beat out. Plus make sure the description of the project is still starting with an action verb, so re-write to focus on something you accomplished"

"Can't say how since math is such a practice based topic, whereas in science, I can just cram info.  One thing I did was I made sacrifices.  I realized that I couldn't possibly catch up with everything, so I took L's where I felt the amount of work I'd have to put in to get the mark wasn't worth it."

"If you feel something is wrong and cannot find a way to change it yourself, then seeing someone about it is a good idea.

Also comparing yourself to others is always a horrible mindset. There's always someone that's worse off than you, but that doesn't negate your own suffering. 

Good luck my dude"
"My CS average was like an 82, but my overall math average was a 75 because I bombed Math 138 lol. So in other words, I think you'll be pretty competitive in regards to applying. Conversely, I could be an outlier with lower grades than a normal DS student, so take my experience with a grain of salt."
"Some CS stuff you can do in the courses (ML, numeric computing, statistical computing) but some had to be self taught since I'm not CS.

There's no way I'd match the intensity or rigor of an actual class but stuff like
Algos, OO &amp; data structures can be self taught and are needed for CS jobs.

"Yeah called them just yesterday to find out one of my tickets wasn't entered in so it they voided it for me. Shout out to lazy parking enforcement guy.

"ece105 was unfortunately more intuitive than ece106

you just need to realize a lot of stuff with angular thing are parallel to the non-angular forms, and since they're so similar, you can handle it. 

ece 106 on the other hand, has fun things like faraday's law, which I still don't understand ... "
"It's a very cool course, such a shame that so many students who would be interested in it have no way of doing so. 

4 stream students in even years will never be on campus when it is offered. 8 stream students in odd years will only be on campus for their last term and it's super unlikely that they could take it or be aware of it. 

Such a shame that incredible opportunities are foreclosed from the vast majority of potentially interested and capable students. So many kids in Systems, Tron, Nano, and ECE would love this but it's just not accessible."
"You can ask your SO to tone down the flirty bits because it's making you uncomfortable. Like IDK what comes across as flirty for you but like if they're sending this one friend loads of emoticons and stuff you can tell them to stop doing that. My BF made me do that when I talk to my classmates like I'm not allowed to send hearts to them after they send me solutions to our practice problems anymore lol. It's not being controlling cuz you're not telling them to never talk to their friend again, its just a small thing that you want them to stop doing. "
"How aren't you able to do any of the past/practice midterm questions? No offense but did you take physics in highschool? Do you pay attention in class? Do you try to learn the actual concepts rather than pattern match the solutions to problems? Are you able to do the work for any other course?


That said it is not unusual to fail midterm then pass the course. I've failed many midterms (even skipped some) and ended up passing the course, but it generally depends on marking schemes, curves, weighting (I generally get 98-100 on lab components which often balance out the midterm to a passing grade), etc. 

But keep in mind the second half of 105 is considerably harder than the first half if my memory serves me right, and whatever you are doing isn't working so figure out a better way to study and learn."
"My manager always brings up the last co-op all through September. ""Andy was very techincal"", ""Andy helped with this big project and we're calling him back to celebrate it"", ""andy took lots of initiative"". I looked up this Andy and saw he had lots of relevant experience to this role, so it puts me down even more :( 


If I bring this up to my manager, won't he think I'm weak or not as determined as the past co-op? I had my weekly meeting with him last thursday, an he was saying I did a good job so far and saw improvement from the first 3 weeks compared to the last. It's just I don't see myself being a quick enough learner as he seemed to be... like even with working with LARGE data processing and analytics that I've never done before. It takes me a while to organize myself, but I'm honestly trying :( "
"The beauty of ECE is that my GPA is ruined, I'll never win any awards/scholarships to my name and every course is absolutely irrelevant to my career. Jokes aside, I don't think an education section brings a lot of value to me right now...

I never thought about adding a location to my work experience. I'll definitely consider adding that where appropriate.

As for the specifics, with the font I chose here I'm running short on horizontal real estate as it is, but I swapped my font to a considerably thinner one which I also like the look of much more. I could definitely fit more information in each line that way, but I think 4-5 bullet points is pushing it for work experience, but I really have too many things to talk about (and details to cover!)... thoughts?

Interests section is definitely optional."

"Psilocybin Mushrooms grow better in more temperate climates. In this section of Canada, there are few species that grow. From this list of species, there are even fewer yet that grow during this time of year.

With all of these restrictions, my estimation is that the nearby farmer's fields are the best place to look. Species such as psilocybe semilanceata (Liberty Caps) and Psilocybe Silvatica are the only mushrooms growing in this season, climate, and general area. Plus, they are more potent than the wood-dwelling mushrooms you might find elsewhere."

"&gt;and your goal is to ""..work a meaningless job ...""

Temporarily, yes. A lot of people are in debt and are forced to take on low paying for a majority, if not all of their lives. Coming from a household where my parents were always in debt from things like student loans, and from failed businesses. 

The amount of money you *need* is shockingly low. My parents never made more than 80k combined in a year. By making 40k each a year, they eventually had enough money to buy a house, sell it and then buy 2 more houses from that money. Now they have enough money that they probably don't need to work for the rest of their lives especially since they don't have kids to support anymore. 

My point in that long winded story was that if I can do that, but extremely accelerated by making 100-150k that's about 85,000 after taxes, saving 50k a year for 4-5 years (assuming , the very unlikely possibility of no progression) could have you 200-250k in savings. More than a majority of north america saves in their life. If I can do this AND STILL BE UNDER 30. Why would I not? All things considered, I still got 35-40 years left to make a difference and do meaningful work. What's the rush?

Even then, sure idealistically, your statements make sense. Practically, they don't. Not many people straight out of university are making a huge impact and have meaningful opportunities. Especially ones that are profitable enough to pay back loans. A lot of startups go bankrupt because they take on too much debt even in this extremely bullish VC era which is gonna get worse when the recession hits. 

&gt;Do these comments make sense to you, in combination?

If money corrupts you or you're just a heavy spender that's on you. It's very possible to live humbly while making 6 7 8 or 9 figures. Plenty of people do it so yes it makes sense. "
"First off, good on you for taking a term off to work on your mental health and taking care of yourself! There are many different types of health care professionals and I'll list a few from experience but you might want to do your own research. I am by no means an expert.

Most therapy is not covered under OHIP. Psychiatrists(doctors that specialize in mental health) are covered under OHIP but most have really long wait lists(6 months to 2 years) and you will need a referral from a doctor(family doctor etc). Psychiatrists can provide you with therapy and can also prescribe you medication.

Psychologists and other therapists are not covered under OHIP and have varying prices. Psychologists can perform psychological assessments whereas other therapists cannot. Psychologists cannot prescribe you medication so you would have to talk to a doctor about that. Usually psychologists charge around $230 per hour or higher.

There are various other counsellors, therapists, and social workers that also provide therapy. Many of them are a part of their own governing organizations(psychotherapists etc). They cannot prescribe you medication or perform psychological assessments. Their rates can vary depending on their certifications and experience but in my experience they typically charge $130 per hour and up. Some offices have a psychologist supervising many counsellors and therapists.

**There's a counselling center next to Laurier called the Delton Glebe Counselling Center. They have a student(any high school, college, or university) discount rate for $20 per hour which is a really really REALLY good price for a counsellor. Even their normal rate at $40 per hour is much much lower than you would find anywhere else. Link:** [**https://glebecounselling.ca/**](https://glebecounselling.ca/)

I also know Better Help is a online counselling resource that is cheaper than regular counselling but I've never used it so I don't know if I would recommend. Link: [https://www.betterhelp.com/](https://www.betterhelp.com/)

Good luck with everything! Keep fighting you're doing great :)"
"My fellow brothers, I, Billy Herrington, stand here today, humbled by the task before us, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our Nico Nico ancestors.

We are in the midst of a crisis. Nico Nico Douga is at war against a far-reaching storm of disturbance and deletion. Nico Nico's economy is badly weakened: a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of acknowledgement, but also on the collective failure to make hard choices and to prepare for a new, MAD age.

Today, I say to you, that the challenges are real, and they are many. They will not be easily met, or in a short span of time, but know this, Nico Nico: they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site, we understand that greatness is never given, our journey has never been one of shortcuts. It has not been for the faint-hearted, or who seek the fleshly pleasures. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the wasted genii, the creators of MAD things. For us, they toiled in sweatshops, endured the lash of the spanking. Time and again, these men struggled, and sacrificed, so that we might ... LIVE BETTER.

We remain the most powerful site on the Internet, our minds no less inventive, and services no less needed than they were last week, or yesterday, or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today, we must pull up our pants, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking Nico Nico Douga.

Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest our server system cannot tolerate too many movies. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what Nico Nico already has done, what free men can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose.

And so, to all the people who are watching this video, from the grandest cities, to the small villages where IKZO was born, know that Nico Nico is a friend to every man who seeks a future of love and peace. Now we will begin, to responsibly leave authorized common materials to Nico Nico people, and forge a hard-earned peace in this MAD world.

What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. This is the price, and the promise, of Nico NiCommons citizenship. Nico Nico Douga, in the face of common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words: ASS, WE CAN.

Let it be said by our children's children, that when we were tested by DOS attacks, when we were refused by YouTube, that we did not turn back, nor did we falter, and we carried forth that great gift of freedom be delivered, and safely to future generations.

Thank you. God bless, and God bless Nico Nico Douga.

"Yes my dear I have considered this and in fact my white male privilege only applies in certain contexts.  These days, my ""privilege"" doesn't really exist in the same form that you mean, it's really quite a disadvantage, it marks me immediately as a target, and I have been robbed, multiple times, I have been mugged, I have been shot.  When I was shot, this was because a man thought I was trying to steal his GF because I took a pic of her, I actually was only interested in the cooking method she was using, which was the burning of a kind of casava coals to make a tea made with ginger called ""bun"".  But anyway that point was lost on the dude, and I was warned not to take pics for this very reason, but he assumed I was trying to steal his GF, which would be very easy because my white male privilege marks me immediately as not only a foreigner but a wealthy one, who can offer escape from desperate human situations, the kind that you do not find in KW.  So anyway he had a gun and he found it and he shot me, just below the right clavicle, but it was a low quality bullet and although it broke the skin and I had to declare the incident at work the same day, it didn't cause any real injury.  nobody ever shot me in Kitchener.  One guy, one time, did stomp on my head on an old railway tile at a pub that used to be the ""circus room"", but I really had to go out of my way to piss that guy off.  Like I was really taking liberty with his dignity, and in the end he did blow me, but, I guess that was too much cognitive dissonance for him, and he stomped my head on the railway tile leaving a rather nasty scar above my left eyebrow.  the cops did essentially nothing.  So, I am speaking with verity, that you really, genuinely, have to go out of your way to cause a problem in downtown Kitchener before you will encounter any sort of resistance, and I know for fact that it is not within the scope of your average UW autist to find this sort of disadvantage.

You are generally correct that I am without fear of rape or harassment or murder, noted.

edit: I encourage women, particularly women of colour, to explore the boundaries of ""safety"" and discover that their power comes internally, from knowing that actually they are not a target, nobody is wishing undue harm to them, they are safe, in face they are a source of wellbeing.  I refer you to mother Theresa - your political leanings against her notwithstanding, she is a meek and powerless woman, and yet she affected so much change.  Would a woman like Mother Theresa be afraid of downtown Kitchener, even if I enjoy White Male Privilege?"

"I can't speak to many parts of this question but I can talk about one key component; the ""bus"". It is crucial to remember that arbus, scibus and enbus are not truly business degrees. No one will view them as business degrees and I say this as someone in arbus. 

Now if you don't really care about flaunting the business element and simply want to have some practical courses tacked on to your degree than this isn't really a problem. Moreover the relative flexability of your program and faculty will make swithcing to a diffrent major (as so many first years do) simple. 

In short, if you are interested in trying the program out and have reasonable expectations for the business component of your degree (and if you intend to pursue an environment based program anyway) there is no harm in giving enbus a go. "
"I had missed my midterm too. I was in 1A, thought the midterm is in the evening when it was during lunch.

First thing that was in my mind was to get some doctor's note, and I did consider it, but I was worried that university might find out it is fake, and I might get heavier penalty for that.

So I just emailed the professor, and went to her office hour next day. She told me to come back during her next office hour. I still remember the first line she said when I visited second time.

""So what's your excuse?""

I just straight up told her that I was dumb, and how I thought the midterm would be at 7pm because all of my other midterms were at 7pm (coincidentally). Then she lectured me on things and added my midterm mark to final.

Now I was very lucky that the professor was generous, but I wouldn't have had that opportunity had I not been honest.

I know you're panicking and stressed, but just try to contact your professor and be honest with yourself.

Hopefully, you're professor is as generous as mine was, and you'll just have to study harder for final."

"WAAAAY more going on, like far more advertisement and publicity for events, constant student life fairs, club fairs, etc. USussex had a website where you can sign up for cheap student-discounted events, or trips to visit monuments like castles or Stonehenge. Overall atmosphere on campus was significantly more friendly and less clique-y. I was having a terrible time adjusting to jetlag and overwhelmed with the new school that I ended up crying after leaving an exchange student event, and a guy came up to me, asked if I was alright, and genuinely sat there and listened to me before inviting me back to his dorm floor to meet with some of his frosh friends (and it wasn't at all weird or dirty lmao, he was very British-polite). University town areas also offer a lot more student events at clubs and bars than I ever hear happening around Waterloo. They're a bit more progressive in some areas, too. I was in Brighton, which is the ""gay capital"" of the UK, but London is well-populated with younger people and they tend to be less conservative at uni. But student life will heavily depend on your school and yourself. I definitely didn't go out as much as I could have because I let my mental state impact me, and stressed way too hard over classes. I loved the atmosphere in England far more than here, that's for sure."
"My reddit client is terrible, so, I have only the context of memory here.  I think I said something like you're wasting your life if you do leetcode?  If I didn't say that, well, that's what I mean.

And this dude asked me for an alternative, so I gave it, ah so yes, I am putting down those ideas because they are not the same values as mine.

but I qualify, I did not attack any individual human, any person you or otherwise, who read this or whatever I posted before.  i shot down the idea (condescended, yes, strongly) of wasting your own personal time doing leetcode.  What a goddamned waste of time, especially when you're young, it's absurd, absolutely unquantifiably absurd to do that.

Is this the OP who said he wakes up at 4am to do leetcode for 2 hours?  uh uhuh.  And I said ""thanks that there are people like you who do that""?   Is this the same thread?

Because yeah man, I need fucking robot boys like that, who wake up at 4am, to study without being paid, whatever new bullshit tech is available, and I'll pay them $100k, maybe $150k, or lol ""stock options"", to prostitute out their brain for a couple years, before I find a new boi who thinks he's special too, who invested a couple years on side projects and leetcode du jour a l'avenir, and rinse lather repeat.

I don't get it nigger, we all have the same values here, you are a code monkey who spends your free time learning leetcode so that a guy like me will hire you as disposable commodity labour?  Where's the difference in values?  We're the same equation you're just on the shit side of it and don't know it yet??   


Sorry, you're full stack, right?  mm hmm.  Don't like QA, of course not.  Understand front end but looking for a career change, yup.  cool.  (career change but hasn't even graduated yet, lol, stupid punk fucking code monkey, smile at him and pretend like that extra $10USD an hour makes a difference, fuck, give him free lunch, he doesn't even know the difference between ustrichnaya caviar and nomihodai - fuck he probably doesn't even shave his balls).

"My bad, maybe they don't hire international students. I just assumed they could since most US companies do.

"So in your social media spectum it seems you only see up or down, black or white, true or false, 1 or 0, on or off, positive or negative ...

"Thanks for these comments! Yeah, I definitely think there's a lot to be unpacked about where STAT 231 fits into the CS side of things.

"Well everyone is different. If we really are grouping them by race, I know a few white girls that would literally say “yeah” the whole time and let the guy do all the talking. Brown guys are too shy to talk to anyone. Asian guys are non-existent at parties, and black people have their own parties."
"Bro for any demanding job this is what many students go through. Mess up and keep messing up, but learn from your mistakes and work hard. If you're a slow learner just work a little longer getting used to everything. Let them see your effort. And remember, it's always good to get a hard placement and mess up tons versus messing up in your full time job. See the bigger picture and just learn. It's not so much your mistakes imo it's your mentality that makes you dread the place. Start seeing it as an opportunity to learn to work under those conditions rather than performing at 100% everyday. Forget about what your manager or whoever thinks, focus on yourself and not on anyone else. I know this sounds hard to implement, but you just need to develop thicker skin. Maybe this experience will do that for you. "
"If it's anything like spring 2018, the second midterm was much worse (first midterm avg was 80 or so, second avg was about 64), but that was partially because it was terribly proof-read and nobody tried due to the marking scheme for your worse midterm.  I personally found the first midterm of that term to be really easy, but that was because I took grade 12 Data which was a slightly easier version of midterm 1 content.

But honestly, just keep on going.  You now know what you didn't get in the course so far, so touch up on that.  Don't fall behind, you NEED the basics to do the harder stuff.  Also it'll show up again on the final.  I would recommend just grinding practice problems - that's the best way to learn stats.  For the final my stats review was literally just 4 days of constant stats problems.

"
"If you are struggling at work and you constantly leave at 5pm everyday. Ask yourself if you are really committing yourself and attempting your tasks - or if you are just bullshitting yourself. I don't know where you get this idea wherever thing you do is supposed to be perfect on the first try? Maybe your initial co-ops weren't challenging enough or maybe you just don't fill well with the current team. 

Failure/struggle is normal in any high pressure environment, it is often sink or swim. Are you taking notes whenever someone assigns you work or when you ask for help? Are you drawing out a process or workflow when you don't understand something? Be conscious about your work quality not about yourself. At the end of the day, people will receive your work (whether it be code, excel or powerpoint) so they can do THEIR work. Most places don't give a shit about a co-op after they've left. I think you're being dramatically concerned over your ""rating"" than your actual performance... when the first step to fix this... is to try and try harder again and again. "
"Kitchener Farmer's market on Saturday 9-2 has meat. St. Jacob's is really good Thurs 7-3:30 and Sat same times. Both are really inexpensive for produce, far cheaper than any grocery store.

This https://www.brandnewvegan.com/recipes/vegan-bolognese-sauce 
says vegan but it's basically just a way to make a good pasta topping with cauliflower and mushrooms. 

My personal fav recipe - Preheat oven to 375. cut up as much garlic as you like, 2 green bell peppers, 2 onions. De stem mushrooms finely. Cook mushroom stems, onions, and peppers, then add breadcrumbs and hummus to make a stuffing mixture. It should be quite dry, but wet enough to mould. Stuff the mushroom caps with this and pop in the oven for about 45-60 mins. 

Also buffalo caulifower. Preheat oven to 425. Cut up cauli into florets. In one bowl, put flour. In a second bowl, put almond milk. On a dish spread our panko bread crumbs.  Roll each floret in flour, then almond milk, then panko bread crumbs (you def want to use panko and not regular bread crumbs). After all have been rolled in the crumbs, bake until golden brown, about 45 mins. Then take out of the oven and coat in hot sauce, bake for 20 more mins. Soooo good on a kaiser bun with tomato and lettuce.

"I didn't take it with the same prof, but I do remember that when I took it our class went into the final with an average waaay too low, so the final was incredibly easy.

I thought I was smart before first year due to the big-fish-little-pond effect while attending a low-mid tier highschool. Average dropped 18% and made me feel pretty dumb. Should have studied harder during the term and then should have done revision during co-op to make the school terms less stressful.
"I'm guessing they're hoping spots open up after the deadline due to people declining but more often than not, Waterloo gets more acceptances than spots so there won't be any extra openings.

"They already do. Regular Bomber wednesday was $3 cover. Themed nights were $5. Now that they've done away with regular wednesdays it's back to $3 except for first and last bomber I believe. The problem is the theme nights don't work either. You are only gonna get as many people as are interested with each theme. Ex. Nocturnal Bomber was dead and they were giving away $1000. It doesn't make sense to have random theme nights, there is no momentum or predictability with it. When you go to Phils or Pub on specific nights you know what to expect. With Bomber there is no consistency. it doesn't make sense. I agree they need to focus on night club and do it well. Ride the momentum of first bomber and deliver the same quality weekly. With the current structure no one knows when/what/how much to expect. It's dumb"
"Misjudging distances is equivalent to being out of tolerance. The work done on the LRT stops was not high quality enough to be accurate the first time, and to redo those curbs did require major work. The curbs had to be demolished back to the rebar and redone from scratch. This was not accounted for in the LRT budget, as it has gone significantly over its original projected price. Also, at numerous stops repeated work exceeded just the curbs. There was continual re-excavation and resurfacing at many points and related to the LRT infrastructure. As for my anecdotal experience with snow, it's far more reliable \*for me\* than any study will be, and that's how I base \*my opinions.\* Further, TriTag is a biased citizen's group with a stated goal to advocate public transportation. Their studies are not academic or reliable, and the one you linked wasn't even well written. It'd be totally ridiculous to trust that over what I've seen myself. And if other people are looking to be convinced one way or another on the snow issue, I'd urge them to wait a few winters and see what their opinion develops into. 

By the way, it's a real show of class to tell people you disagree with to ""fuck themselves in the ear."" What has this loony world become that non-conservatives are totally incapable of civil political discourse?"
"- At first glance this looks like a very sparse resume. Fill up the space by adding more bullet points under your projects and work experience and listing information about your education such as relevant courses
- For your projects section make sure you include a date (year) and a location
- For your Education section include the year your program started (i.e. it should look like 2018-2023). This will help provide context for which year you're in and if you're on track
- Do you have other contact info you can include? A github? A personal website? Linkedin? Consider adding your location (just city is fine)
- Your interests (hobbies) should not be at the top of the resume. it should be the last thing the recruiter reads as it isn't that important. The top is for highlighting things
- For your first section are there any programs you've used that you can list?
- Provide a year for when you got your President's Scholarship and include relevant courses under your Education section (look for courses that include buzzwords of your field/jobs you're applying to)
- Do not include ""I"" statements in your resume. Instead every bullet point should start with a strong past-tense action verb (I.e. Created an application...""
- Time dilation android app - provide a bit more context. What kind of travel time does it calculate? How does it capture this data? 
- Your 2nd bullet point under your time dilation app doesn't describe actions you did. Re-write to focus on how you produce this feature. I.e. which language,program did you use?
- What was the end result of your time dilation project? Did you achieve anything noteworthy with it? Why did you do it?
- Provide more details and tasks you completed for the C# Library. You should have 3-4 bullet points here. Focus on pulling out relevant skills
- Provide location for your work experience. It's relevant for recruiters to see which office/HQ you worked at
- Your bullet points for your work experience are too vague and don't point towards skills relevant to CS Be more explicit. I.e. developed time-management skills by delivering products to designated areas. Don't write about the boring mundane things you did. What actually required skills and was impressive? Try to add more bullet points. If you need ideas of what to add, Google coveted CS skills and try to include that somehow"

"I collected my key deposit a few days back after having the exact same issue as you.

Apparently Ontario landlords are not allowed to charge deposits outside of last month's rent according to this [link](http://www.ontariotenants.ca/law/law.phtml#Q18) with a few exceptions. You are entitled to receive the deposit back, keep persisting or they won't take you seriously. Good luck and feel free to PM me for more details."
"In that case, I can give you some insight into mech ! 

I’d suggest you do 4 month terms to start off so that you get a feel for what you want to do in the industry (unless companies like Apple come calling). You also don’t want to get stuck at a job you’re going to hate for 8months. 8 month terms can be useful at the tail end of your degree (I.e 3B) , where you could use that as a  transitioning role into a full time gig . Obviously, this would mean you’re going to be off stream with your class for the following terms until 4B. Hope that helps. "
"UWaterloo is contractually obliged by another contract to attempt to gain this intellectual property. They KNOW they have no chance in hell of winning, but they legally HAVE to try in order not to be sued themselves. 

It sucks that he has to go through this but most likely the case will be dismissed. It happens a lot with conflicting contracts or laws in interjurisdictional cases. 

Waterloo 100% fucked up in signing the contract with Argonne that mandated them to do this, but that mistake is substantially different than suing a student for an invention"

But how do I adjust myself to spend less time on school and more time on stuff I actually enjoy and most importantly be okay with it? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's difficult, I have always pushed myself to do the best I can in courses. My MAV is like 86, so nothing special, but at this point I feel like I don't mind if my grades drop if it means I can spend more time on other stuff. But obviously that is easier said then done, I have to undo what feels like 30 years of pure dedication to school, and now I'm just trying to be okay with taking a step back? "

maybe for you. I have a lot of disagreements with people on things I consider to be cultural, spiritual or emotional differences. As such, I see that it's foolish to apply *logical* fallacies to illogical (emotional, faith-based, cultural) personal views. "
"A few good ones I usually defaulted to were:

1. What does a typical day look like for the current co-op?

2. How would you describe the team I’ll be working with? How many people? Is there lots of collaboration with other departments?

3. What do you think are the most challenging tasks in this role?

"Beautiful�� idk a large number of classical pieces by name so had to look them up just now and spent an extra 20 minutes checking ones that came up alongside them too��pianists and musicians in general are amazing

"I believe profs usually post enough material so that you can study without using 3rd party resources. If you actually need help, visit profs and TAs during their office hours or email them.

I have seen OneClass material before and I think the material profs provide us are more relevant than their notes."
"I'm not a don, but to boost your resume I'd recommend First Aid training and some sort of Mental Health First Aid/ASIST/Safe Talk. You would be around a whole bunch of first years who often struggle with the transition and showing that you're educated about mental health protocol probably goes a long way"
"Lmao 58 Cardill - thought that address sounded familiar. Lived here in the early 2000s, didnt realize it had been demolished to make a condo

Best part about that house was this washroom in the basement that had two toilets right beside each other - no divider or anything. Just two toilets and a sink lol"
So  you’re proposing that everybody born in all these different edgy Asian/Scandinavian/etc countries give their kids English first-names that are hard to pronounce in *their* native languages? Just to make it easier on them in the statistically rare event that they move to an English-speaking country?
"what faculty are you in?

I assume you're international from the username.

You gotta make sure to follow up with people repeatedly outside of clubs/class/whatever if you want to be friends. Like turn to the person next to you in the lecture right before lunch and ask if they wanna get food in the plaza."
"&gt;  Campus police are real police in every way.

lololol ok right right right.  What do you think [these guys](https://www.pao.ca/public/) have to say about that?  Real cops?  Driving around ring road?  I'll suck your dick buddy, I'll suck it till you cum down my throat.

Beyond that, there aren't even any real cops in all of Canada.  [Real cops](https://i.imgur.com/6T0G885.jpg) won't hesitate to shoot you in the face, cause they know they'll have no consequences of it.

I have a place to rent downtown Kitchener, $400 a month, if you're not too ascared."
"If you're new to deadlifting I'd say keep it low for a couple weeks till you get a really solid handle on your form. I've seen many people deadlift with rounded back. If your form is good I'd say go heavy and do 5x5. If you can do 3x8 of 185 maybe give 5x5 of 205 or whatever is hard. With squatting try variations on low bar, high bar, and front squats. I mostly just do low bar and front. If you're novice level check out Alan Thrall on youtube he makes great lifting guides. It's pretty straightforward bro the heavier shit you lift the stronger you'll get. "
"You all as a class know who this guy is, so after you report him you should all stop hanging out with him and let him know what he did is not gonna be accepted in your class! This will force him to either apologize and change or stay alone in class. Judging by how he feels the need to be accepted, I'm guessing he'll just apologize and change.

Also I'm surprised one of the other guys in the class didn't step in when he was getting aggressive? Nothing tones down someone bullying a girl like a guy threatening to kick the shit out of him. If he ever threatens a girl in class again, a group of you guys in class just get together and intervene, it doesn't have to get aggressive, it's just a reminder that if he wants to mess with someone he should mess with people his own size! The guy's a fucking loser anyways!"
"I was the president of Yu-Gi-Oh club back in high school and what we did was borrow ChromeBooks from the library and played online. The site we used was https://duelingnexus.com

If you've been around the Yu-Gi-Oh community, I'm sure you've heard of Dueling Network, which lets you simulate the card game online. Dueling Nexus is similar, but it's closer to the video game version of Yu-Gi-Oh (such as Duel Links). That way, the ruling is handled for you and you won't get into fights on which effect activates first etc (in particular, a large part of the club, including me, weren't too familiar with how Link Monsters worked since we, among many others, quit when Pendulums came out).

I'm not sure why I'm saying all this, but I'm just glad to see Yu-Gi-Oh brought up here in the SubReddit. It was a huge part of my childhood, from elementary to junior high and somehow made a comeback in my last year of high school. Overall, it's a pretty dumb and imbalanced game, but it binds me to wonderful memories and often I enjoy reminiscing the people I played Yu-Gi-Oh with."

"I didn't need to adjust, I was able to keep up without modifications. That being said, I did notice some things over the years. You should try to understand concepts instead of trying to do endless practice problems. Exams are designed to see how you can dynamically apply the concepts to learn so it's really difficult to study all the variations that can pop up. 

If you can't learn everything then cut losses and learn what you can. Your own learning rate is basically fixed so you have to optimize around that and come up with strategies that work for you. "
"Right but again, it takes 30 extra seconds to write ""I'm sorry for your loss. Counselling services is available to help you if you feel you need additional support"". I'm not saying profs are expected to open their arms up to students in distress and console them, but at the same time, professors should be conscious of the immense stress causes by university and have a little compassion sometimes. It's clear when a professor responds as if they don't care about you or if they respond like you're another human, the difference doesn't take much longer to type"
"Based off of Waterloos data, I have a 50% chance of getting in &gt;95  and from 90 to 94 you have a 10% chance, and that's for SE. I emailed Waterloo, they actually told me to be competitive I need to have a 95+ for CS as well because last year they had the most ever applications to CS , and they only admitted one for every 23 applicants... so chances are 1/23 when completely disregarding grades.

I currently have high 90's in everything but I'm hoping to get at least an 80 or 75 in English. However even then, my average will still drop to 93-95. Which means I wont be competitive. I am starting to read novels however before my second semester and to try to get as good as I can to achieve maybe better than what I'm expecting. However its still highly unlikely, not confident in my English like I am with my sciences/math. There is still a chance that my English isn't as awful as I think it is because I went to one of the top schools in Alberta, and the average grade in that class was a 50 something (gr11) and everyone resented that teacher for her hard marking."

"A breakup isn't a ""mental issue"", it is a personal issue for sure but it shouldn't defer you from writing an exam, even if you're very sad.

I probably have been going too far off of my own thoughts to convey what im actually trying to get at idk.

"I worked for an online tutoring company in my first coop and I once had a session with a guy, maybe 17 years old, who did the whole thing with no shirt on.  I don't know if he didn't realize he'd be on camera or what.

"Elora Gorge is great although during peak season it gets very busy. I have been in the summer on a weekend and parking was a bit tricky. Unfortunately I can't speak to how busy it is at this time of year.

- Crawford Lake/Rattlesnake Point (a little further but worth the drive for the escarpment views)
- Shade's Mill conservation area (Cambridge)
- Not sure on specifics but I know Hamilton has lots to offer if you're willing to go that far.

Hope this helps!"
"I mean I made this username when I was an edgy teen. Now I’m probably the polar opposite and I still think it’s a little funny but I’m not really in that place with my life, and I cringe to think that it was funny enough to make my reddit username in the first place, but I’m not just gonna abandon it.

That’s only tangentially related. I’d love to join you with your noosage so long as the string will snap if it attempts to suspend your body and the drop wouldn’t kill you either. Knot tying is a skill I’ve been dying (heh) to learn after all!"
"I am so sorry for you loss, but like others have said, your well-being comes first. I would highly recommend considering to defer the term. I know in engineering the cohort system is nice and if you defer you’d graduate with a year later. But honestly that is okay. I know friends who deferred to the next year because of program switches etc, and they have all said they didn’t really lose friends, their friend circle just got wider. 

Reach out if you ever want to talk, I know how it feels because I lost someone I cared too in first year, at a time I honestly didn’t know the fuck I was doing and if I was doing the whole CS thing right. It sucks because I can never tell them it all went okay in the end and they were right that I should stick to CS and try it out. Maybe, someday I may be able to do that. "
"The horrifying bacterial assault in washrooms could be quite effectively negated by ensuring that all toilets, urinals, taps, and paper towel dispensers are sensor activated. Additionally, standard low-pressure blow dryers should be taken behind the wood shed and inundated with steel spheres of death since they are entirely useless and a grossly inefficient allocation of precious resources. 

It is already possible in most washrooms to sharply tap the kick plate of the door as you hastily flee the bowel dump of society. I fear that airborne particulate shall continue to threaten our survival, unless a significant volume of air is sucked into the disposal piping with every flush. However, creating such sensational suction and replacing the unwanted air would come at a steep cost that I fear we cannot afford. "
"1. If you don't communicate that the sex is going to mean something, I would assume the default assumption should be that it isn't going to mean anything. If you actually wanted a relationship with someone you would probably take a bit more time to work up to it and probably talk about it first as well. 

2. Men are the primary instigators of sex which is rooted in both nature and nurture. 

Put 1 and 2 together, and it makes sense that women who are the gatekeepers of sex and reproduction should guard themselves against non-committal guys. You can try creating a societal situation where guys are more willing to commit to relationships and don't pump and dump, but there are always going to be at least some guys who have zero interest in LTR. Therefore, it is logical to tell women that they should deflect sexual advances if they are looking for LTR but don't have any reason to believe the guy feels the same way. You're just setting women up for heart break if you naively assert that the guys are entirely responsible for explicitly defining what the sex means. "

"Another longtime poker club member and first time exec this term here.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry that you've experienced this change this term, but I definitely hear where you're coming from. Exec team has already been discussing ways that we can improve both in welcoming players of varying skill levels while having a space where we can all play and learn but most importantly have fun together! (Cheesey I know lul)

&amp;#x200B;

Anecdote from me- in the past few years I've been coming I've def learned a lot from other players in the club by asking them for feedback on my play.  That sort of environment is what made me wanna get more involved as exec this year.  But I def hear you that depending on how that feedback is sent or if it comes without being asked for that it can be less of a learning experience and more of a put down.  So yeah, I'm seeing that difference in what you're saying and in the club in general this term, and hope we can turn it around.

&amp;#x200B;

Really hope you'll give us a chance to improve as the term moves forward and that maybe in a couple weeks you might come back again and give us another shot!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I've also been a passive member of ESports club, playing TESPA hearthstone with them a few years ago. Couldn't make it out last weekend but glad to hear it was a good time!!"
"Well I definitely didn't expect you to reply haha. I'd like to at least make it clear that my comments on STAT 231 don't reflect on you as a prof at all.

My jaded perspective on the course is likely due to being a CS student who is forced to take the class to graduate, and while I found the content of S230 relatively useful in understanding probability problems, I'm not sure I can see this class having any crossover with my career or future courses. I think the fact that it isn't a prereq for pretty much any CS courses speaks for itself. Feels like it was just plugged into the degree requirements because they wanted us to take more Math courses, in which case I would have been much happier with a ""ONE OF {STAT 231, ACTSC 231, MATH 237, MATH 235, AMATH 250} FOR BREADTH"" requirement.

\&gt; I would wager the majority of STAT 231 students will never calculate another maximum likelihood estimate, but they \*will\* encounter opportunities to apply the principles from some of the 'softer' chapters. I have worked with non-statisticians from a variety of scientific backgrounds, from researchers to doctors to google engineers.

I hope you're correct.

\&gt; What I take from the original post is that a number of students are prepared to sacrifice 20 minutes of sleep, but not 50 minutes of sleep, to sit near my face.

Yeah that pretty much sums up the original post. Perhaps you guys should do a study on how early students are willing to arrive before class for optimal seats, although I'd wager the 9:30 section would produce much different results than the 8:30 section ;)"
"Ok I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you don't know calling all white people who don't want Canada to be 20% white by 2100 Nazis is literally coded speech for globalists who are chasing corporate monopolies and societal chaos to inflict even more control and surveillance on us.

&gt; really need to lay off conspiracies

&gt; everything is coded Nazi language!!! WW2 is still happening!! They're gonna kill us all any day now!! I don't hear what they're saying because this is what they actually mean!!

Lol m8. Where do you even go online to become this way? Reddit I guess? Salon.com? 

Look up the word ""balkanization"", or actual white nationalist movements like http://northwestfront.org

They are simply advocating for a space where white people can have their culture and stop bending over backwards to serve immigrants' needs like Liberals do in Toronto and Vancouver. It's not a radical idea, there are plenty of countries in the world today that are 95-99%+ homogeneous and no one seems to care, even some of them are white, surprisingly.

There's no violence. Not even hatred. Do the Japanese ""hate"" all non-Japanese? No. They just want to live as *Japanese people*, and not pseudo-Americans through Hollywood entertainment culture and various other aspects of multicultural globalism.

There's nothing wrong with the Japanese doing it, and there's nothing wrong with white Canadians or Americans doing it.

Most people on this subreddit are immigrants, so their parents cared more about money than preserving their culture. Well some of us Canadians don't share that sentiment. Really, get over it, and let us have the conversation. If this idea is apparently so absurd and violent, then that will become clear as it's discussed, plans are drafted up etc. So far, I see nothing indicating any need or purpose of violence."
"Formatting is definitely more than a little weird, in fact it's distracting me from the content. I'll assume for argument's sake that it's just a fluke and I'll only comment on the content (but if it's not, stop reading my comment and fix your font/spacing *right now!*) 

* The details of your experience and projects are very vague. Imagine you asked me what I did at a hackathon over the weekend, and I answered ""I worked on a webapp for the past 36 hours."" That's about as info as ""Managed the Admissions Office"", ""...various predictions... multiple simulations"", and ""Created an Android app for currency conversion"" provide to me as a reader. Unless you're tailoring this application specifically for say, XE.com, whose *raison d'etre* is currency conversion, the fact that you ""just"" made an app to do so is irrelevant.
 * Most employers are more interested in what tools you've used in your work and side projects rather than the actual content of them. Predictions, simulations and Elo rating sounds relevant to finance, so expand more on that! What predictions and simulations did you make, exactly? Did you use Python (scipy, pandas?), R, MATLAB? Link to your conclusions? Anything interesting about the money converter or textbook adventures to show?
 * Your experience makes it look like you were an 'ordinary employee' at /small company/ and /school/. I hate that being 'average' is now considered... below average, but it is what it is. Did you do anything exciting at either position? Assist in anything major? Save time, money, or both? Otherwise, they're completely irrelevant to finance and data analysis. No bueno.

* I understand you're interested in finance, business and data analysis. So far, what stands out to me on your resume that's relevent to the aforementioned is your NBA Elo Project. I'd be interested in your Python and R skills, and for you to demonstrate your passion for machine learning (probably in a side project or two). My point is, if you handed me a piece of paper with **literally** just the words

 * Python &amp; R
 * NBA Elo Project - Predictions, simulations, and visualization
 * ML

 on it I'd be just as impressed as if you handed me your entire resume. That's not a good sign. I'd search long and hard for more relevant side projects to put on here if you're particularly interested in those careers.

"Haha, my mom realized that a CS career is still something she could boast about to her colleagues, so she's accepted my major choice (even if she thinks CS = IT). Also, my younger sibling has decided to try writing the MCATs, so she's got that, at least.

She basically emotionally abused me into being a passive doormat in all aspects of my life (including telling her to shut the fuck up), but I also now live a 15 hours' drive away from her, insta-delete her emails from my inbox, and never pick up her phone calls. Frankly, I barely think about her these days."
"SYDE has been around forever (since the 70's I think?) and it's well known among many employers. I knew many people who went through that program (a few transferred into it from my class) and they didn't have a problem finding jobs.

Geo is not really that unconventional. It's been around for a long time and can be found at pretty much all the big engineering schools in Canada, although it might go by a different name (UofT calls it Mineral, McGill has Mining, Queens and UBC have Geo)."
"So in my experience the Society Presidents/Reps /u/leea0526 and /u/uwsci287846 and myself pull on stances, opinions, and views expressed by our councils, our exec teams, and in some cases our Boards of Directors.

"CHE102 is always really hard for first years. You’re not alone. It was really hard for me. It was really hard for all of my roommates. You can pass 1A and fail CHE102, it happens all the time. Don’t give up yet. 

You can do a couple things:

1. Go talk to your WEEF TAs. The Chem TAs are super nice, and there are chem help sessions twice a week. They’ll go over assignment (or assignment similar) problems in the help session and will talk about assignment questions with you if you go see them during the day. 
2. Go talk to your professor. If your professor is part of the problem, go talk to one of the other instructors for CHEM102. There are like 5 profs teaching it and I know that several of them are really happy to sit down with students and talk about concepts. PM me if you want me to recommend one.

To this day, I have never asked if someone is saving a seat. I just sit down. Because I got there before them. Period.

They are going to go back to their country when they're done anyway. And thank God for that. 

&gt; Oh noes, poor S :( he got annoyed so hard that he became racist! But it's not his fault, really!

That's literally how people become racist. By interacting with foreign people all the time and realizing how fucking annoying they are to live around.

&gt; Also previous comment about ""fobs act like cunts 24/7"" nice generalization there bud, definitely no racism here

Call it whatever you want. Chinese fobs act like entitled cunts."

Actually they do. They guarantee two non-weekend study days before exams, which is the same as it is now. 

The two replacement days (as proposed) will come from the labour day Wednesday and one extra Sunday exam day. That’s it."
"I did my 3B term at HK PolyU. 
I took a a few core courses and the rest were electives (less class/ workload = more traveling). 
Regardless where you go, know that you can take online courses from Waterloo! If I had known that it would have made my term a lot less stressful when midterms/ finals came around "
"I got only one single call at the end of continuous. I got thru with that. Things have a way of taking its time. Just keep applying, get feedback wherever you can, keep updating your resume and you'll be fine. Being afraid is fine. It's normal but it changes nothing. So don't let this affect your academics. "
"I guess it depends on whos using the word?

"
"Idk.. wait a bit and see if he replies. Maybe try visiting his office too (I know it’s the last thing I’d wanna do too)

Similar thing happened to me, prof gave me a huge extension last minute. I didn’t do the assignment but showed up for the exam and passed. So it depends if you care about your grade."
"No, they said they both mark on right answers and number of questions you answer. The time limit is set such that basically no one could do them all, but theyre testing for speed and accuracy. Like the example question I typed up, they're not hard at all, just meant to see if you can be attentive to details "
"The whole point of the coding challenge is to confirm that you have the skills for an interview. If you passed it, then you're good enough for the interview! Interview questions are not significantly harder than the coding challenge.

"There doesn't have to be an objective truth for something to be an argument.  You can argue about subjective things.  

Ad populum is just saying that you're stating an argument as fact through popular appeal - it makes no claims as to whether or not that argument actually is fact.  Its really not that deep."
"This was actually briefly brought up at the most recent Senate meeting. While the idea is there, it hasn't been discussed in depth nor has any research been done on it's need. I do think it would be harder to get it implemented, as many look forward to the extended break in between the Spring and Fall terms."
my only other recommendation would be to go to the hospital. they’re definitely more urgent-focused than the walk-in. they won’t laugh at you and say ‘just take OTC stuff’ if you say your pre-existing liver condition is causing you problems and you’re having extremely bad insomnia. i wish you luck!
"I think you're underestimating how shallow humanity is. [Infants prefer looking at attractive faces.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6355-babies-prefer-to-gaze-upon-beautiful-faces/) [Children prefer being friends with attractive children.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223980.1983.9923606) [And of course, people choose dating partners based on physical attractiveness.](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/4/5/508/)

From birth to death, ugly people have it worse than attractive people. I didn't think this was a controversial statement."
"Okay I can't speak to fries because I'm wierd and generally don't eat those. Buuuuut
I don't care if it's cheap tbh, if I want a cheap ass burger I'm going to Macca's and getting some value menu stuff.

In n out is cheaper but I'm not looking for that, shake Shack mushroom melt has those umami af mushrooms, a gooooood smashed patty with some crispy texture, glorious glutenous buns and that Shack sauce.

In n out is definetly good I agree with that but imo the argument here is irrelevant on the price side. If I was dirt cheap food I'm not going to either place"
"Rent varied but usually in 500-625 range.

 Food: I generally cooked most meals ($60-70 a week in groceries, I bought steaks a lot lmao) and mostly ate at home. Occasionally, I would get ramen or takeout 2-3 times for lunch. All in probably the same for groceries but definitely spending spikes a lot during midterms/finals. Let's go with 250-300. 

I catch a movie on Tuesdays maybe once a month so let's say ~50 on entertainment. 

Phone: 35, used to have very little data because I was on campus most of the time, switched to data when I had two coops in a year."
"What happened to Biol 240? When I took it, the average was 73% on the midterm. It was multiple choice and out of maybe 60 questions. It sounds like it got a lot harder than it was back a few years ago. It was the one course I found the easiest and now it sounds brutal.

Just study as hard as possible for the final. When I took it, the final was out of 100 or 120 questions and 2/3 was based on the last five chapters. Make sure you attend every lecture and pay attention. I've failed bio midterms worth 30% and still passed, so sometimes you can power through it."
"What you were getting paid in your last role is somewhat irrelevant, unless it's with the same company for the same role. This new company probably has a different pay structure and it's probably a slightly different role (even if the job title is the same). Either way, it doesn't hurt to negotiate. There are different ways of asking whether you're male or female though. Feel free to PM me and I can try to walk you through the intricacies of a negotiation. :) You'll need to figure out what value you bring though and give reasoning as to why you're worth more."
"Yeah I totally agree with you 100%.   He tried to help the students by actually making it easy and all you gotta do is come to class. It’s just sometimes he makes it so easy that he fucks over half the class. 

Like he wanted to give everyone a easy question and have the class get a free 10% but what he didn’t take into account was the fact that many people thought the quiz would be on the homework questions he posted( calculations) or theory,/knowledge that we learned in class.  Not some fact that was in the textbook, which by the way is NOT required. 

"
"Note that the following is from my experience being an **undergrad** TA for the **Mathematics** faculty.

Did you get an official email proposing a 2nd TA job as a marker for the 2nd course ? If so then this would count as you holding 2 TA positions and you would be paid the sum of the respective wages (which could be different, depends on the courses being marked, Math 145 pay is higher than Math135 for example). \[This usually occurs when the faculty is short on TAs and would like to hire more,and it prioritizes students who requested 2 TA positions when applying to be a TA\]

However, sometimes a section would fill up over the term and TAs for the course would be assigned progressively more work, this however counts as you having 1 position still and you would be paid for the solo position.

From your description I assume you're in the 1st case scenario and I assume you'd be getting roughly double the original salary, but to be sure, you should contact the undergrad office of your faculty (which I assume is your employer ?) and they would be able to confirm."

I guess I thought it was implicit that we have less time to learn a certain amount of material, my bad.

"If I recall correctly, all three referendum questions were meant to be independent of one another.

People don't break the law for the sake of breaking the law, they do it to serve self-interests. Some of these self-interests are immoral because they hurt people, others are not and shouldn't be treated as such just because it's grouped with immoral activities. I can very easily group pitbulls with dog-related fatalities, does that mean we should demonize pitbulls? No."
"The program is currently this way, but the identical programs lead you into majors like cs and stats. In order to have a foundation for pure math, you would have to take a special type of courses which has a pretty small class every year. 

 A really unpopular opinion I have right now is that I dislike the way they teach linear algebra. Instead of using a regular Lin alg textbook, the non advance sections use a Waterloo made book where they miss out alot of content (e.g.spectral theorem). So the general course for the first 2 yrs is by default not really pmath"
"I'm a senator on USRC (Undergraduate Student Relations Committee) and I had very similar concerns about the clause about disciplinary action against students for repeat offences / non-payment of fines. It seems like it was just a carry-over of language from the previous smoking bylaw, but I'll definitely be pushing Chris Read and others on the committee to look into some reasonable limits on that clause (that, or naming policy 72 as a policy that this clause would explicitly not override).

Tackling class G policies in general is a harder sell - and while I agree with the premise of increasing student engagement in the policy drafting process, /u/sachaforstner has a good point about why senate isn't the right avenue for this. Gonna ask around if some base level of consultation can be incorporated into policy 1."
"So you lost 6.75% in one class. Over the 40 (or so) courses you'll take in university, this is less than 0.17% of your overall GPA. That's nothing! 

Sometimes quizzes are just really surprising and you study all the wrong things. But you still learned all the things you did study, and you're gunna use that info you learned on the final and in future courses. :D Multiple choice quizzes are the worst in terms of this because sometimes I swear it's literally the entire exam is just filled with trick questions. 

As you go into upper year, you're probably gunna get less MC type exams and more written answer exams, where you can explain yourself alot more and not rely on knowing exactly the right answer, so you dont need to worry about ""omg am I studying the right stuff"" as much. 

Alsooo it sounds like you have great study habits already so thats gunna take you alot further than other people. If you wern't cut out for this kinda academics and didn't have the skills to suceed, UW wouldn't have accepted you. &lt;3 So what if you had one bad exam, just keep trucking. "

"I could be wrong but AFAIK you can only get a CS minor at UW by transferring to CS for at least one term if not more to take some courses that you aren't permitted to take otherwise. Which would also require you to change faculties before you could even declare CS as your minor by transferring into the program and then back out. 

It's really only designed for faculty of math students that were in Computer Science until sometime in their 3rd-4th year and decided to switch to a different major within the faculty of math, but still wanted to hold on to the minor."
"I still think you should have just searched it yourself, but if you're not willing to do that I figure I might as well help.  I don't think you're *wrong* about anything in particular.

I don't know what kind of work you have experience in, but software development, for one, tends to have a pretty relaxed environment.  Finance, on the other hand, is known for being very intense and requiring long hours.  A large part of that is probably the idea that any time you're not working, you could have been making even more gobs of money, but that's just my speculation."
"You're right, I don't care.

"yep. Problem is Hackerrank fucked up the tests for C++ and parsing steps of the input which made test cases fail.

For ex. one of the inputs was

3

5 3 4 3 5

problem is, the first line is supposed to be the number of items in the next line, which made the array passed to the function be

\[5,3,4\] instead of \[5,3,4,3,5\] which is the wrong input.

There were solutions on hackerrank that changed the parsing to get the right array and pass it into the function but , in the challenge the parsing part was uneditable thus it was impossible to pass the test cases."

"I don't think the name means as big of a deal in Canada as it does in some other countries (most the US, where alma matter is much more prominently discussed). UW's reputation is also pretty specific to Eng/CS/tech, so in that sense I think the name brand matters even less if you're outside of those programs. Not saying Arts or Business-ish programs at Waterloo are *bad*, but they definitely don't have the same reputation/alumni network/prestige that some other more Arts-focused schools in Canada have (i.e. McGill, UBC, Queens).

I think the main reason Waterloo would have an advantage would be co-op, but that gets muddled when you're a transfer student. In this case it's tricky to gauge, but if you stay at another University too long and try to transfer back, you won't be eligible for co-op since the sequencing of co-op terms won't be compatible with how many academic terms you have left. If you're trying to break into a field like Marketing or Sales, your degree matters a lot less than other business fields so ultimately you have some program flexibility there."
"I generally don't mention my marks, but I suppose it's relevant.

I've used tutor connect at least 3 times in the past. First time I used it was for stat 231.  Single session of 3 hours with a tutor, something clicked, did fine in the course.  Got high 80's or low 90's IIRC.

Second time, I rocked a 35% on the first midterm of an actsci course which was quite a kick.  I felt I understood the material, but couldn't get enough on paper in the time allotted. Did an  hour a week with a tutor for the rest of the term.  I finished with an 82.

Unfortunately the courses I'm taking now generally don't have tutors available, because given the choice, I'd use a tutor even if I wasn't struggling.  That being said, using tutoring also helped me refine my learning techniques, so I have less need for them now.

So yeah, two thumbs up for the university offering this as a resource.

Added:  An hour a week is also a good way to stay on top of the material.  When exams come, things become a review instead of learning - because you've already done the hard learning with the tutor."

Thank you so much! The fact that I always recieve marks below the average has been haunting me for over a month. I am just afraid that I am not gonna survive the first year if I can not even get  average marsk on the early assignments and tests which are usually considered relatively easier than the followings.
"Thanks, it was the only way I ever learned in high school (never once was able to pay attention during class)  but I’m afraid it would screw me over in uni or in 2A and above.

Is it common for profs to cover things in class that would end up on an exam that aren’t found in the textbook or online materials?"
"Yeah I'm friends with a few, it's just a big portion of them seem to struggle expressing themselves in English or are simply not interested in breaking our of their friend circles.

"""What is something you wish you knew before you started working at X?"". It is asking for their opinion, which everyone likes to give. Can also be a good measuring stick if having multiple interviews at the same company. If keep getting the same answer, you know something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

If want to ask about compensation, it can be better to ask what the benefits are like. Leave salary for when accepting an offer, especially as for negotiating salary, it is better for you to bring up the first number if you know what kind of range to consider."

"For my first co-op, do you guys think I should take a QA position with Blackberry or a Python Programmer/Business Analyst role with a smaller company in Toronto? They both pay the same but I'm leaning towards the Toronto company because they offer versatile opportunities based on what I want to do &amp; gives me a chance to work with data analysis which I'm interested in. That being said, my end-goal currently is to make it as a software developer in Cali &amp; I'm wondering if having a well-known name like Blackberry could help me progress in later co-op terms."
"If you want to check if you’re tyres are flat usually you can just squeeze the tyre with your thumbs to see how they go in. If you can squeeze them pretty easily, then you probably need to pump more air in them. Also it’s recommended to have back tyre pressure &gt; front tyre pressure. If you continue w/o pumping your tyres, you’ll risk damaging the inside of the tyre and you’ll have a harder time riding compared to pumping the tyres. Usually you can buy a bicycle pump for $10 at any department store. It’s usually a pretty basic item if you own a bike."
"Stick to it man, you really have to bust your ass in 291 to do well and legit study everything possible. I had like a 45 going into the final but somehow pulled it up to a 65 after curves and really grinding that exam season. I wouldn't count yourself out yet, see how the next midterm goes. Dropping it now will really delay your 391 and 491 if they don't offer it during spring term. Keep trying man, I took 291 as a motivator to do well in future accounting courses and ended up with a high 90 in 391, and so far have a high 90 in 491. You can do it, I believe in u"

2. Just admit that uw is officially no fun and has no life or character and can't even sustain one fucking bar and close the place down, maybe convert the school to Islam or latter day saints to raise profile.

"a pass is a 60 for the flight core classes. They're not necassarily difficult, but contain a ton of information and memorization. The hardest one you'll probably find is the first ppl course, most stuff after that is review. I'd say it's about equal to the weight of 2 courses, and flying in itself is equal to the weight of a university course. 
I'm taking cs246 right now and find it harder and a higher workload than anything i did in the aviation program, but I'd say the aviation program was a higher workload than any of my science courses. Does that make sense?"
"I honestly think the first thing is a good thing.

See above comments. No one is encouraging this. If anything it should be a point people can reach across party lines and realize no one wants to kill each other (hopefully).

I think you might want new thermometers, because most people are not on either extreme, and are fed up with the polarity. 

Now that I haven't ignored your comment I want to ask you a question. What has any of this affected in your life? Say you were completely oblivious to it all, would anything about your daily life change if the laws of a foreign nation change? Would your life be better or worse? If better, why do you now cause yourself unneeded suffering? If better, how so? "
"My friends from MMath stats who decided to get a job after graduating instead of doing PhD all got offers with starting salaries between 80-105k (in GTA) so they're all doing pretty good job wise.

IDK too much about the Data Science program since it's only been out for like a year or so and my sample size of people in it is too small. /u/isyndicate is doing it right now tho so maybe he can give you a better idea of what it's like.

As for the regular MMath stats program, everyone is put into the course based/research paper option first, and if your grades are really good, they let you switch into the thesis based option. I don't think it really matters which one you do as for job prospects/getting into a PhD, but the course based one is usually a term shorter  which means you get to work sooner so there's that. "

"It depends on your priorities honestly. If you only ever sit in your room and go to a kitchen to make meals and then go and eat in your room, then paying cheap rent and living with others is good. 

However, I am old and decrepit and not just looking for a place to go home to to sleep at anymore and am more so looking for a home to call my own. So it all depends on kind of where you are in your life. If I didn't have certain responsibilities (pets, car, boyfriend that visits regularly), then I would definitely opt for a cheaper living situation closer to campus. "
"Hey /u/TylerMarques great question!

So the mechanism is encoded in the Bylaws (Article 8.8(2-4) under the Duties of Councillors that are in the bylaws, there's also further duties and requirements outlined in the procedure /u/jassmall references, eg. we count committee attendance towards Council attendance).

Societies are all but one of the removal qualified persons, this is because they turn-over frequently! The Speaker, Elizabeth O'Sullivan currently, tends to object to the consideration of the question (as a standard order) for any item of business that is removal of a Society's representative _when it's due to turn-over of that society_.

The one AHS representative will be called to a vote at this meeting. So we shall see. Thus far we have held two expulsion votes for an Arts and Math Councillor; the vote to remove the Math Councillor carried and the vacant seat is going to a by-election very soon :) 

_Side note: My pleasure! We are trying to massively increase accountability in Feds, and it's a long, but worthwhile effort! This list is part of that effort_."
"Hey guys it's me, Oliver! First off thank you to whoever shared this article, glad to know it's reaching the student population. I think a common sentiment among us students is that there needs to be big changes to how student housing is handled in this city.  My first priority is going to be eliminating the rental-housing by-law, while coming up with a real solution to address living conditions for students.  This by-law is one of the most ineffective and costly, and it has solely contributed to rising student housing costs in this city. It has increased student housing costs by about $70-$100 per month, per student. It was intended to improve the conditions of student housing, and while it caught some violations during its debut in 2012, it has become an ineffective and expensive piece of garbage. As your city councillor I will be the best person to represent your interests on council, because clearly we don't have that now. I would love it if you guys came out to see me next Thursday on the 18th and ask me more questions at the Bomber, hope to see you all there!"
"unironically be yourself, because otherwise you'll end up with someone who likes the facade you're putting on, instead of actually liking you. this got both of us in trouble in the past.

don't give yourself away for free, insist on a high level of commitment before a high level of intimacy to weed out the losers.

dont think of yourself as ""lesser"", hedonism and vanity are the virtues of 2018 but they aren't really what's important. personally, I prefer girls who wear no makeup, and I don't mean the ""natural look"" that guys think is no makeup, I mean *no makeup*. this might seem weird to you but this is for 3 reasons that I think are actually important:

1. The most obvious reason; wearing a lot of makeup is just whorish looking and is an attempt to put you above the man by a few pegs using artificial means. That may not be the intention, but here is a guy just trying to groom himself and figure out which is the shampoo and conditioner, and you're using rocket science on your face to look like a supermodel. It's just a psychological barrier.


2. Non-verbal communication is limited, meaning your ways of showing attraction, rather than blushing and flushed lips etc. are flirting and cheesy lines for the guys. My current s/o is the first girl I went on a date with who didn't wear makeup and I had never felt so wanted by a girl in my life, even though I had previous long-term relationships with very um, feisty, women... these non-verbal signals are very primal and are being blocked, resulting (I think purposefully) in superficial connections based on all sorts of stupid things like shared interests in TV shows for example.

3. It's like wearing another girl's face. There are about 20-30 makeup ""faces"" or looks out there, and the end result is that every girl ends up looking the same. And not in a good way, either. You want a guy to fall in love with you, while you look exactly like every other girl? It just makes you another thot in his porn-addicted mind.

Lastly, find quality men. This means probably not at UW unless you're looking for an ethnic match for religious/parents not killing you reasons, but even then there are almost certainly better options elsewhere.

My \#1 piece of advice for people trying to live a more traditional life in any aspect (in this case, attracting a real partner rather than a Tinder date) is to re-connect with your religious roots and find someone there. I don't even care what your roots are, I think this applies to everyone. Well, except some protestants like the United church who are probably even more degenerate than the general population."

"Yes. I had a friend who went through the process before me and it was in Kitchener. He was originally scheduled in Boston but it was exam season so he wasn't able to go there, so they moved him to Kitchener. His preferred place to work was in Kitchener, so it was odd that they placed him in Boston for his onsite."
"You can always skip one interview and ceca will make you send an apology letter. I did so in both the terms I was searching for jobs in.

"Actually when I took his 221 course, we did a question regarding the visibility spectrum and he doesn’t tell you what it is. You had to know it or else you couldn’t answer the question correctly.

I don’t get how people expect him to teach a 2nd year course with 300 kids and a 3rd year course without making it simple. Plus he’s physically doing research in lab too. People need to cut him a break "
"Yeah, I think the default is no offering, just because it would mess up the normal sequence of 2nd year AFM courses. It might be worthwhile to look into if you think you’ll be able to squeeze the additional course into your requirements in the next few semesters though. Keep in mind that the job searching process is also strenuous and shouldn’t be discounted when thinking about taking 6 courses. It might not seem like too much extra work, but when it comes to applying and having interviews during a 6-Midterm (at least) season, it can definitely be challenging!"
"Hey bud, Im a 3A on my co-op term ATM. I got a 14% on my CHE102 midterm so I feel you and I understand what you're going through (at one point I thought of taking a reduced course load as my midterm average was slaughtered by CHEM102). Best thing is to go to the Civil WEEF TA's and ask for their help. Bob usually selects a TA that did well in Chem. If you get stressed, talked to Bob about it as he can give you guidance if needed. 

What I learned in Chem was that reading the textbook was the best thing I could ever do. It refounded the basic concepts like mole ratios, limiting reactants, gas law and electro Chem. For the exam, try the practice exams/questions with a friend who understands the concepts 100%, not just how to do a specific problem. Hope this helps in some way. PM if you've got anymore civil questions!"

"&gt; Paying for a bar indirectly positively affects health, as silly as that sounds.

A bar I don't go to or have any use with, that has equivalent bars of at least like kind and quality in the same general area? Might as well get feds to sponsor the cheese club too. 

&gt;  We have a serious problem with UW students not being social and relaxing once in a while.

What's stopping them from doing it at one of the other bars/clubs like molly blooms, wilfs, kickoffs, phils, night school, and so forth?

&gt; Just because it's a mental health issue doesn't make it any less of an issue.

No one's disagreeing with you that addressing mental health issues, but saying ""paying a premium for a bar that's turning a loss due to low attendance 90% of the time that can be replaced by other bars"" is alien, and it doesn't just sound silly. 

They could just as easily turn around the money they spend on the bomber with something higher in demand that's less replaceable like another counselor. 

I can't disagree with you more, and no it's not ""just because it's a mental health issue"" "
"Despite how childish your replies are I’m amazed that a bunch of university students are straight up online bullying a kid in grade 11...

To ACTUALLY answer your question. It depends what you mean by “best”. If you’re looking at rankings then they are predominantly based on graduate studies and research output and do not really consider undergraduates. Since universities in Canada are public they all have governments mandates to achieve and for UofT that is research. I’m not in CS, but I’m assuming the reasons are the same for why I choose to come here for ECE. Waterloo is more difficult to get into because in terms of wanting to get an education alongside a proper practical learning experience there is no school that comes close in Canada. The undergraduate education itself I’m guessing is relatively similar, but Waterloo has the huge boost of 6 coop terms and being reputable worldwide for skilled students who know how to apply their learning. 

Also on the more personal side, you should learn to respond better on the internet. Even if they are coming from a negative place, you’re just feeding into that by replying to it. And keep in mind it’s not people’s obligation to answer your questions, this isn’t a classroom, if you want to be helped have a good attitude about it even if others don’t."
"You touch sensitively on many good points.  In particular, in the depths of depression:

&gt; that I did my laundry, that I went for a shower, that I drank water.

&gt; Forcing myself to push and to do small tasks like getting a glass of water, or splashing water on my face, 

Things can get much worse, which is where the death spiral happens.  At least eat and drink water, and shower sometimes.

But some other things you said draw my concern:

&gt; It's an achievement that I get up and I finish an assignment,

&gt;  I remember that it is an achievement that I am still trying. 

There are many theories on depression, here is mine, take it or leave it, but solving it worked for me.

I was investing so much of my own energy in goals that others had set for me, and which I had mistakenly adopted as my own.  I highlighted two things you said, above, because they indicate to me you are still spending enormous energy in goals set by other people.

All things considered, maybe you would benefit from looking what are your own goals, without reference to other people.  Try writing down what's important to you, personally, without mentioning or depending on anyone else, including parents or friends or anyone.  Just you мой дорогой.  

It could be that you're spending a lot of time/energy being ""pushed"", and maybe it's time to figure out who/what is ""pushing"" you?  

Prisoners are ""pushed"", happy people ""walk"".

To where would you like to walk, мой дорогой?  You don't even need to know the best answer; any answer above being a prisoner will do.

Kind regards."

"Unless… It’s not admission average that dictates how well the team does.

Seems like there’s a negative correlation between how well BlackBerry does and how well the Football team does:

* When the team last did well (in the mid to late 1990s),  making provincial finals four times in a row,  blackberry was just   Starting to make a name for themselves

* The team  started declining, becoming worse  and worse over the next 10 years,     while  BlackBerry went in the complete opposite direction

* in 2010, the team reached an all time low,  culminating in  a steroid scandal that shut  them  down for a year.    This was at the same time that blackberry’s  smartphone sales reached an all time high

* over the next eight years or so, the team hired new coaches and recruited new players, trying  to get some kind of a rebuild going. Meanwhile, blackberry has come  down  from their peak over that same time period,  eventually having to get out of the smartphone game entirely

TLDR:   Negative correlation between blackberry performance and UW football team performance"

"It's a stock message; the guy has nothing on OP and certainly no saucy list of websites.

"One time I asked somebody what they were studying, and they said something that sounded really interesting that I haven't heard before and I asked ""Oh what is that?"" and they said ""I don't know"", then I said ""Why are you studying it then"", then they literally broke down in front of me and I didn't know how to react"

"That's understandable. I really liked it so it was easier for me although near the end when we straight up add to memorize a few lists of different bacteria and their functions, I lost interest.

But hey, I got *really* awesome marks in high school, and I got lots of scholarship money and awards, so it all works out, right? /s"
"What are reddit ads?  I have never seen one.

I think I need to do a post where I explain how to surf the net and never experience an ad, whether reddit, youtube, yahoo, msn, or your favorite quasi legal streaming site.  

I think the last time I saw an ad while surfing the net was like a decade ago, perhaps longer.  I am always puzzled when talking to clients and they complain about the ads on youtube and I am like ""what?"" as I had no idea there were any until I disabled everything in my browser so I could ""enjoy"" the full benefit of google and its tracking habits."
"Please, you're placing all your self worth in your attractiveness. You go from calling (or admitting? doesn't matter) yourself ugly to saying you won't amount to anything. 

I'm a dude, so I can only tell from a second-person perspective how much women are put down and trampled for not fitting into society's stupid beauty standards. But that's just society, don't let that determine your self worth. 

You grew up in what sounds like a shitty home environment. Your dad is a man who fucking calls his wife and daughter useless. (Judging by that, he's the useless one.) Since your mom was unambitious, you probably didn't have a strong female role model growing up. *And yet here you are*, at UW, studying something that you hopefully love and can see yourself building a future in. 

Honestly, if anyone dismisses you entirely based on your appearance, they weren't worth your time anyway. The people who belong in your life are the ones who can see you for who you really are, on the inside. You've already made it to an admirable point in your life; don't let them drag you down. "
"Frankly, I don't think bomber is untenable, and frankly I'm a bit surprised that bomber in general is as unprofitable as it is. 

To start, I don't think leasing the space or franchising are good options. As you say, franchising could urn afoul of food services, and frankly I'm not sure how a new restaurant would change the situation bomber is in. As for leasing the space - Not super keen on this, since the bomber has at least a little bit of personality and if some random other brand can make money (hypothetically), why can't bomber break even?

As for status quo and rebranding, at the end of the day I think it comes down to what the goals are the bomber are and where the money is going. What I'd ask is:

* Does it make sense to run more events like bomber Wednesday or to increase the cover?

* Should the beer/drink/food selection be scaled back? Are there items that are far less popular?

* Are the prices appropriate?

* Is the construction impeding business?

Honestly, at the end of the day, for me I generally don't find myself at bomber for a few reasons:

* I'm in engineering, and the SLC is way way way farther than the plaza.

* I have little interest in the bomber wednesdays or club nights

* Sometimes I like going to the bomber for their pretty good breakfast offering (especially the potatoes!), but the service I've had there the last few times is dismal, for lack of a better word. Servers are slow to attend to tables and to the front, and one time I went with my friends when they were grabbing lunch and one of the waitstaff snapped at me for waving him over.

"# Board Voting seats

The VP Education's and VP Student Life's aren't overseen by the Board, but rather by Council, and the Exec represent a huge voting bloc. Given that the executive can use this voting bloc to force through changes (like bylaws) and hold meetings with few directors at quorum themselves, this change will bring better accountability to the highest decision-making body in Feds. 

This change gives them a _voice_ but not a _vote_, which means the Executive team will need to _convince_ other directors not just force things through by calling the question or other procedural gimmicks. 

I will note, the Board has recommended this item be adopted, and I personally think it's a welcome change! I hope you encourage your friends to come out and vote for it :) 

# Online Voting:

Re: this meeting online voting -- nah, in order to do that we needed to change the bylaws, so we are recommending those changes at this meeting (first set of bylaw reforms on the agenda) to fix it going forward.

If the first set of Bylaw changes pass at this meeting (the ones that are recommended by the Board and put together by the *Task Force for GM Engagement and Council Reforms*) then all future GMs will allow online voting!! 

If those bylaws do not pass, then no, online voting won't happen soon.


NOTE: s.125.1(1) of the *Ontario Corporations Act* was amended in December of last year (giving the corporation a 1 year timeline to implement bylaw changes to allow electronic/telephonic voting) ... That being said the amendment the Act specifies that **""Unless the by-laws of a corporation provide otherwise,...""**. [You can check out that section if you're interested](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c38#BK144)!

"I was born in Canada and speak only English and I got a conditional pass on the ELPE. Then I went to the review and they had circled literally one grammar mistake... They could not explain why I failed, the guy reviewing literally said ""Huh, this essay is fine, I'm not sure why they failed you"". Some people think they failed me because I have a name that is clearly European and they thought I was a white FOB and they wanted to fail more white FOBs to not look racist. Idk if that is too conspiracy theory or what but my essay was fine and they had no reason to fail me."
"Ya sometimes (I've usually seen it near DC bus stop) you'll find a car which is driven by someone (usually a student) who has been hired to drive students free of charge. There is an on campus shuttle and an off campus shuttle.

The off campus shuttle can give you a ride home and the on campus shuttle can take you somewhere on campus (though if it's late and not busy, they may be willing to drive you home)

Simply approach the shuttle/car and give them your student number and ask for a ride.

Not sure what the schedule is for the service, you can probably google that"
"I did the same-ish thing. I was suppose to graduate in April 2019, but ended up graduating two terms early by skipping a school and co-op term. Seems pretty worth so far, no regrets.

1. Very easy in your situation. Graduation and visa complications are very legitimate reasons. 

2. First, meet with a CS co-op advisor in person or over email, and manually confirm that you meet graduation requirements. Then, in your 4B term, starting June 1 2019 in your case, you can submit an application to graduate here: https://uwaterloo.ca/forms/undergraduate-studies/application-graduate

3. Earliest might be early September. Unofficial marks don't come out until mid-August. Registrar then needs some time to confirm your requirements, and do paper work for early diploma. 

For early diploma, send an email to the Registrar's office."

"75% of the content of the exams are from the notes he gave you in class so it's really important to have good notes. For the textbook, just read over all the chapters and hope you remember something you read (it's impossible to memorize the book and the questions can literally be from any small section in the book). 

So, memorize the lecture notes and make sure you remember every detail from them. That'll get you at least 75% confirmed. And from the book, maybe try to memorize some key definitions and literally just pray that something you read comes up in the exam. "

"Rent: 720

Phone: 50-60 (covered by mom's work)

Transportation home: 20 (once per month, mom drops me off in Waterloo)

I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting and I'm not very strict, but this is how I planned it out and for the most part I'm within these amounts. I make my own icedcoffee/tea so I save like 20 a month on those! I also buy from the farmers market for fruits and veggies and bought the massive Costco chicken thighs pack twice per term. "
"&gt;It doesn't bother me when they disappear after showing disinterest, but when they seem interested, I wonder what caused the sudden disinterest or if it was there along.

Same. 

It’s like either they were pretending to like me or something put them off/they changed their mind. Though that seems pretty drastic. 

I recommend not texting them first after the dates. Also stop approaching guys as awful as that sounds. People are trying to say women are empowered but it’s not true. Most men are biologically offput by role reversal, even if they deny it.

I’m also gonna say that part of the reason they might be leading you on is so that they can trick themselves into thinking they’re good people, like they didn’t just immediately stop talking to you when there was no possibility of casual sex.

Hope this helps."

"If you're in a program that has two streams (ie. ECE), you can join another stream and rejoin your original stream later if you want. 

I've lost my mother a few years ago near the end of my 3A term (I had to skip the last 2.5 weeks + finals to take care of my mother at the hospital). I postponed my finals for the summer term for grievance and to help with all the things after the funeral. In addition, I also postponed my coop job (CECA isn't that evil, they were understanding and I was in good contact with them, my academic advisor and my HR contact). I was able to rejoin my original stream later and graduate on time with my peers. Long term, you'll be able to pass and graduate, so don't sweat about this and spend time on yourself and your family (however long you think you need to take).

In the hospital and after, I remember reading books on belief systems (in particular, Zen Buddhism). Even though I'm agnostic, it helped me cope better with the situation. It's important to keep your mind occupied but leave room to feel sad and grieve. 

Take care and my condolences."
"To add on to what /u/GreenBurette covered, I think the handling of policies (documents that present the federation's viewpoint, mostly for the purpose of establishing what advocacy is done) is one thing that needs improvement. If you look in our [policy book](https://feds.ca/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/sc_policies_september_2018.docx.pdf), you will see a long jumble of policies, many of which have technically expired (most policies need to be renewed every 3 years) and a lot of them seem irrelevant. There is a committee (PPC) that is supposed to be review these policies on a regular basis but they are busy enough handing new policies. Meanwhile, for the remainder of the policies, whether or not anything is pursued with them is up to the whim of the execs. In general, the level of cooperativeness between execs and councillors varies quite a bit (some of the execs this year are better than the whole team last year).

That said, some recent moves to improve this:

* Changed the procedure surrounding policies to clearly delineate advocacy policies from corporate ones (relating to Feds's own operations) and putting appropriate processed for establishing each.
* Have a new process for the committee dealing with academic/university issues (EAC) to develop one advocacy policy each term on something of high relevance (supplements policies developed by individual councillors). This term, the policy will be on open education resources (as an alternative to costly textbooks). ~~Next term's policy might be on a subject of~~ *~~immediate relevance~~* ~~(I'll update this later tonight).~~ UPDATE: Never mind.  The policy for next term is going to be on course evaluations.
* (On the agenda for this sunday's council meeting) A resolution to have a summary of all policies (among other things) posted in an easily accessible page online."

I guess it depends on what kind of person you are..."
"Mentioning that you're having abdomen and chest pains will typically raise an eyebrow, although since it's not acute you will most likely still have to wait quite a few hours, but it's worth a try to at least get your foot in a different door if trying out walk-in clinics etc. hasn't been working out. 
Best of luck :/"
"None of your comments prior to this stated that you didn't have romantic feelings?? Even if one of them did and I missed it, it's not my job to read every single one of your comments in the thread.

"Not worth it dude.

Although not checking off all the boxes you have here, I dated someone in the past that made me feel like shit all the time.

"Pretty much memorize all the facts in lecture. That's 80% of your mark. For the rest, it's random questions from the textbook. If you aren't crunched for time right now, I suggest reading the textbook alongside memorizing the slides.

The midterm is very easy if you have stuff memorized. Don't worry about it too much."
"The culture is more academia focused. If you're into partying, you should probably befriend some people at other universities that you can go see and party with. It's not that we don't like to have fun, the culture here just incorporates socializing into studying more.

This line of thinking is scary because if everyone thinks their vote doesn't count or won't change anything then no one will show up and vote. Your vote counts and can change things. Voting is simple and does not take up too much of your time. Candidate information is easy to Google and should help you make a decision
"Well you can get lazers to lighten your eye color. I'm not sure if they can change it to any color you want yet tho which is why I said ""somewhat"" changeable.

"You're asking the wrong questions, its objectively better in the still warm corpse of the West so they're just being rational beings.

"No doctor should not take a patient seriously and even if that doctor was thinking that most likely your chest pain was a symptom of ""emotional"" distress vs a physical ailment there are certain tests they should have performed immediately just to rule out physical issues.

May i suggest that you visit Student health services and speak with a doctor.  Another option is to visit emerg when you feel all of your symptoms occurring at once.  Student Health services will take you seriously. 

Good luck and do let us know what happens after you have had some proper diagnosis."
"We aren’t completely powerless, but mostly, yeah.  You could go to a different province where tuition is lower.  Student loans do cause price inflation but a most of it is similar to most skilled service sectors such as healthcare. In first world economies service inflation is higher than goods inflation and there are multiple different reasons for it. What I’ve noticed is a rise in the amount of administrative staff at the department faculty and university level compared to even a decade ago. I’m not an expert on why that is but I don’t see any easy solutions."
"Last Winter (so my 1B term). So at that point I only had 4 Math courses and 2 CS courses under my belt. I did talk a bunch with advisors in regards to applications/the differences between BMATH DS and CS DS, and one of them (a super helpful dude) was telling me about how the process works a bit. Basically you can apply every term, and they'll accept x amount of people. That means you can also apply whilst you're on coop. Applying during the spring term also greatly increases your chances because not many people apply then or something? Honestly, still not too sure what his reasoning for that was when we were talking.

In regards to differences between the programs (CS and BMATH), I think it really just boils down to Breadth and Depth, which BMATH doesn't have, and the ability for CS students to take a wider range of CS courses. I've been meaning to go talk to an advisor again about that though because DS at UW is still in its very early stages and thus can change quite a bit, so take that with a grain of salt.

Side note: I got my acceptance in like the first week of May"
"I found what helped me the most was the separate my work and play area. It makes me keep my mind on work when i'm at my dedicated work desk. Obviously I still get distracted often (like, all the times on reddit lmao) but at least now I'm not really thinking about makeup or gaming or whatever because I've given all of those things their dedicated tables where I do those activities at.

The other thing I do is keep an agenda with all of my chores + schoolwork. You're probably going to be pretty bad at guestimating how long things take at first so give yourself buffer room. Once you finish a task, and if it's not time to start the next task you can play games or something or just start on the next task and shift everything up. I spend like every sunday just planning my week tbh like it really helps me out alot when I can just open my agenda everyday and know exactly when/what/how much I'm cooking, fi I need to do laundry, or if it's gym day. Prevents me having to keep on remembering stuff like ""I still have spinach in the fridge and I need to eat it before it goes bad"" or ""I gotta do laundry by tomorow or else I'll run out of clothes"" or ""did we run out of eggs yet? Do I need to buy any next time I grocery shop?"" The lack of stressing about these kinda things lets me focus on my work alot better when I am actually working.  "
"I did a CHEM 494 a while ago so I sorta know the process. Before you talk with the professor about opportunities, I would look them up (prof lab websites) and their publications that come from their lab, which will tell you a little about their methods, special equipment used or techniques related to their lab. You shouldnt just go in blind so definitely prepare, even if they dont talk about their research, it looks bad if you cant at least mention something about their work.

I think you should pick a prof based on their research, not just because of their name because your going to be committed to the project for 8 months and if its something you dont like, well that sucks. Also, you should look at choosing a prof to help set you up for the next stage after undergrad (as you will do it in your 4th year). If theres a field you want to work in, find a prof that does similar things and ask them for any openings. There is no better place to learn and make mistakes without too many consequences. 

You will likely be assigned to another grad student working in the lab who will be your mentor. In my experience, I didnt get to see my prof at all except for lab meetings, but on a daily basis I was working with his grad student. Maybe this may be different for other profs who arent as busy (mine taught 3 diff classes as well), so I think you shouldnt expect them to be super hands on with you.

Also, Id bring along a copy of your resume with skills you know, co-op jobs etc so you can give them something to remember you by or contact you with. Goodluck!

EDIT: Also, you should look early. For example, typically students start in 4A (Fall), so I would ask in Winter of that year, as in 8-9 months early. Trust me as someone whose gone thru the process, if you want choice and options you need to start early!! (even if it seems too early)"

I think you missed the point of their comment. You might be better served to pause and think about it critically. People who are gay generally don't have children of their own. This means they don't have skin in the game. 

This doesn't mean they don't care about the well being of their society. But due to the fact that they won't have children are more likely to burden our social systems, which we can't afford at current levels. All of this is in spite of the fact they pay taxes.

"This is definitely doable - the exams for CS 245 draw almost exclusively from the assignments and the assignment questions are very similar to the in-class examples in the online lecture notes and the tutorial questions they post on the course website with solutions.

As long as you can self-study the course from the lecture slides and tutorials, you can do well on both the assignments and the exams. I messed up on both the midterm and the final and still ended up with a relatively high mark (85+), mostly because the average CS student isn't that good ;)

The main issue is whether you want to take on a toll over coop and whether that time can be better spent doing something else. If you'll just end up spending that time watching anime, then I would suggest you go for it; otherwise, delaying CS 240 by a term isn't all that bad, it just means you'll only have 2 ""free"" terms to take whatever upper-year CS electives you want to take.

"I don't really care what people value but it gets really annoying when ECE students complain that they are doing too much circuits or hw/low-level programming and not doing enough computer science stuff in the program.

"Anthropocentric environmentalism is something I could support, except I won't support socialistic environmentalism on a provincial or federal let alone global scale. I can't stand the way the public sector and the courts/etc that prop it up milk the system for all its worth, they talk big but when the cuts come around they always use unions and legislation to make sure its everyone else getting fucked over the most. So in that respect, yeah well fuck you if you believe so strongly in this why don't you put your head on the block as well?

Also, the ""environmentalism"" that has been pushed for the last while puts one kind of lifestyle above others (A lifestyle that is far more waste producing than the one I live, except ""muh density""), and quite frankly its a lifestyle that I strongly dislike and will never adapt to. 





"
"Personally for me, self respect comes from within. It's about me doing the things I said I would. That doesn't mean getting perfect outcomes for everything I try. It means saying I would do A by time B and actually going through with it despite any circumstances. Self respect is about doing things I know are not easy to most people (like public speaking, taking hard courses, or embracing my identify and personality (wearing makeup + bright-coloured hair dye). It is also about standing up for what I believe in despite potentially getting ridiculed and alienated by some people( like not eating meat). At the end of the day, you are the only person who knows deep down what you did or did not do or how hard you tried, so I guess self-respect is also about being true to yourself and thankful to yourself for doing what you did. "
"- Are there any other relevant tools that you used besides Excel that you can list in your summary of qualifications?
- I would add a fourth bullet point to your summary depending on a major skillset that the specific job is looking for. This will help tailor your resume and be more relevant
- ""iForce Consulting Indonesia"". How did you create the HR Internal reporting system on Excel? Which functions, tools, code, etc. did you use to achieve this? Give some details
- ""Presented the spreadsheet to the HR dept. in a directive meeting"". What was the end result of this? Was it helpful? What did it achieve? What tools did you use for this presentation? Be explicit in the skills used here
- ""Translated foreign agreement docs to English"". This seems very vague. What kind of documents did you translate? Is the translation skill relevant to the jobs you're applying for? If not, what was the content in those docs or which skills did you use that are actually relevant to your major/job you're applying to. Only list skills that directly link to the work you're looking for or have soft skills
- ""Organized, with a team,..."" Too vague again. What exactly did you do to organize this event? Secure sponsorship? Head of logistics? Marketing? Etc.
- ""Cooperatively assisted international students..."". It is not recommended that you use the word ""assisted"" on a resume as it does not give any insight into what you actually did. How did you help those students? What program, tools, methods were implemented?
- ""UW Bike Centre"". Interacted with customers.... this is a given and doesn't display any skills or seem impressive as written. What did you help with? What did you do that was special here and worth noting? How did you ensure that customers received bike repair service? How can you relate this back to math/stats jobs?
-""Checked constantly for consistency in weekly cash records"". How? With which tools? And to which end effect?
- In your Education section try to add more relevant courses, relevant projects, extra-curricular. Try and fill it out basically

As a final note you really need to fill up your resume. For a 3B student you don't have many experiences. Look into getting involved on campus, pick up side projects, do some part-time work. Anything to pick up skills and have something to include on your resume as it currently looks a bit sparse.

"Hey I'm also from BC! Waterloo Eng definitely gives you a leg up in the industry ties and you will be doing more as a 1st yr eng than a lot of 2nd or 3rd yr eng students at other universities. The city itself is pretty quiet outside of campus but you're only there half the time. Co-op every 4 months takes you everywhere from Chalk River to downtown Toronto to Cali.

The program is a lot of work and it's stressful moving all the time but well worth it. Compared to my Eng friends at UBC, I'm definitely more ready and connected to the real engineering industry.

"I agree with 95% of what you said, and you have said it eloquently.  You have also pointed out things where I agree I am wrong, so I wish to address those.  

My quick thoughts, are that there is a difference of language, a tendency these days to lump all ""mental health"" into the same bucket, which, similarly to talking about something like ""sports' or ""religion"", is unhelpful.

Sorry I have lost electricity and internet credit in my particular location and need to deal with that before I address your well formulated ideas with more respect.  Kind regards to wait, please."
"University of Cambridge is more of an academic focused university, with the education quality being one of the best in the world overall (and I believe it has the best CS program in the UK). 

- Supervisions is the highlight of the Oxbridge Universities (Oxford calls them tutorials). Essentially the equivalent of tutorials but with a much smaller group size (one academic with 1-3 students max). 

- University of Cambridge has connections to Silicon Fenn, which is a smaller technology hub located within the vicinity of the city (but the biggest in the UK and one of the larger ones in Europe). 

- The name brand of Cambridge is on par with Waterloo for CS. For any other topic or subjects, Cambridge has a significant more name brand power. 

If the end goal is primarily to work at Silicon Valley without any care for personal learning, University of Waterloo is the choice for you. If you believe that academic learning is very important and you want to grow your academic knowledge in CS, Cambridge is better (but that doesn't mean networking events w/ SV companies are limited).

"You should check out there gene-cultural co-evolution then. Suppose if homosexuality tolerance decrease the reproductive fitness in the current environment, it is incredibly likely that it is very harmful to the inclusive fitness of those who possesses this cultural trait. You might also be surprised that there are studies out there that shows most behaviors are significantly heritable, and that homophobia is one of them. While I don't have sources for this, I remember reading offhand that studies have show that homosexuality ironically have a lower heritability than homophobia.

I'm sure you are aware of, but liberals have less kids than religious conservatives. Yes, there will be continued, signifcant defection of religious to liberals, but the trend can very well change if religious conservatives works out better way for retention along with genetic changes in the longer run.

Well, I met Chad, that's his real name, at Bobby O'Brien's, some, 6 years ago?  More?  The reason I approached him was because he's beautiful, and i was drunk, and I wanted to get laid.  so I thought, take my chances.

Turned out, he was remarkable with philosophy, and math, not particularly artistic, and we drank all night long.  He came back to my house, we didn't have sex, but he slept in my bed.

We stayed in contact, he invented some artificial GF, I didn't know that at the time, he continued to call me, we hung out regularly, we had particularly deep conversations, he was stunningly intelligent; he could synthesize ideas from all genres of experience, even though he was quite young.   

We enjoyed hanging out with each other for many reasons, a number among them unhealthy, but I would help him get girls, and me, I was just happy to party. 

One weekend we partied very hard.  he came to my bedroom, as he often did after I passed out, and said many things to me, which I ignored, because I had a coop downtown Kitchener and had to work in the morning.  I think maybe he passed out in my bed that night, i'm not sure.  

But in the morning I drove him to the bus station on my way to work.  I felt really sketchy.  On Tuesday his mother phoned me and informed me that he had hung himself and his father had found him dead."

I would say yes still go in person because CECA will mark you as either having attended or not.

"It was just on the waterloo housing postings or whatever the main site is that everyone checks.

"I don’t quite get the mountain analogy but it sounds like you’re saying women are objectively worse than men and that doesn’t make me feel very good.

I think a lot of girls naturally feel shameful about it. That’s why there’s the whole “last minute resistance” thing they teach in pick up arts. Women don’t want to just say yes and feel like sluts generally. 

But yea don’t ask me about the slut walk cosmo people. I just call those feminists. They think they’re empowering women but really women are putting themselves at a disadvantage/in a bad position when they hook up.

Although, what exactly can you say to a woman who doesn’t want to have kids? You can shame her for it, and she may even be ashamed of it too, but that won’t change her mind. Wouldn’t it be bad for her to have kids against her will?"

"For the math faculty, we are only expected to accommodate changes to grades up to 2 months after the final exam has been written.  After that, depends on the prof and the situation - but it is relatively easy for the grade change to happen, at least in math, since the system is electronic and takes about 5 minutes, if that."
"I usually don't answer that question. Or at most give an answer of I was paid decently. If they ask you to quote a salary figure, just say something along the lines of ""I expect to be compensated fairly for the value I bring to this company"". Generally speaking, you do not want to be the first one to give a concrete number."
"It’s ok man. I got 30 on the midterm and ended up with 76 in this course. Grind out midterm/finals problems and go through the process to make sure you don’t make dumb mistakes as one small mistake is losing 10 marks since it’s mc. Some questions on last years final appeared in past finals, just with different numbers"
"My dude I failed 3 of my 5 courses in 2A. It sucks, but acting like you need to drop out as a result is silly. Talk with academic advisers or counselors and explore option if you feel you need to change something to recover. I ended up taking a year off school and that helped for me and there are many other options as well."

"Sounds trolly, but I see where you're coming from. I'm not for giving non-residents all voting rights, but shouldn't university students atleast have limited voting rights, possibly in a reduced capacity/worth?

"Take FR101 (or even 151) both are bird courses. Make sure you start studying a few hours before the tests and you're good to go!

"This. Only recently have some departments begun to focus on hiring tenure track profs that also have good teaching skills as well as research skills. Before that, quite often, professors were hired for their research in the community.

&amp;#x200B;

In grad school, we aren't required to learn how to teach. We are learning how to be researchers. We aren't in teacher's college. If you're passionate about teaching there are things like workshops through the Centre for Teaching Excellence to improve your teaching skills, but realistically not many students participate in these. "
"I said ""allowing"" because the original policy passed by council in Winter 2017 (FY16/17) prohibited referenda on matters of BDS from occurring again. 

This council said that old version of the policy was ridiculous and a violation of free expression of students in their democratic student union.

So yes council did ""allow"" it, insofar as we changed the policy to not structly prohibit such referenda going forward. 

I'm not trying to strike a nerve or be elitist. But I do take serious issue with the accusations that these councilors are power hungry and that most seats go unclaimed on council. The past two years it's been nearly full. This year 1 seat is vacant due to a seat distribution error in allocation by the Board. And everyone I work with or debate with (in disagreement or otherwise) at council is passionate and cares."
"Hey /u/randomuwguy the General Office is big because it's predominantly for the Feds insurance, legal and contractual expenses, memberships, banking and salaries. Feds covers insurance for all the hundreds of clubs and all the constituent societies (like EngSoc and SciSoc). Feds also retains _legal counsel_ for the corporation which falls under here.

This budget is restricted because (particularly in legal and insurance matters) your opponents knowing the size of your war-chest is not always good.

The Board of Directors and the senior management team constantly explores options to minimize these expenses, to provide the best value-for-money for members (inline with the Feds [corporate policy on Value-for-Money](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/sc_policies_september_2018.docx.pdf), page 64).

**Note:** there's a Feds General Meeting agenda item for this October's meeting that will require all these budgets to get vetted by the _Budget &amp; Appropriations Committee_ (student filled and appointed by the GM and Council) before the Board votes on them."
"Umm idk how far I am lol, maybe like 1/3 of the way. I took Math 235 and Calc 3 last term, I couldn't get myself to focus on school though, and did really horribly for lin alg 2 and failed calc. So I don't know if I'll even be allowed to take the courses I want because of my poor grades, even if I believe I can handle them now. We'll see next term. If I don't do the minor or option, I'll probably still try to learn math stuff in my own time cause learning is funnnnnnnn and I do find the content interesting.

Yes it's definitely worth it, I'm nowhere near your level of wholesomeness, but I've noticed that the kinder I am, the better I feel about myself + it makes other people feel better and brings out the best part of them.

&gt; hahah imo they're good people but for the sake of keeping it relatively short and not combing through their personalities, etc, I'll just say that we all definitely each have our share of good and not so good traits/habits/etc

ha ha yeah true, everyone has they're flaws, but they must be pretty awesome overall for you to have turned out like this lol"
"as others have said: 1 page pls

you don't really need your GPA on it unless its super high (and idk what 'highest' means lmao a lot of people can have a 4.0 after a good 1A, the whole point of gpa is consistency

you can also cut your coursework and 'additional skills', since coursework is all on your transcript, and employers prob don't care about HS stuff really

you don't need a professional summary, that's CECA bs, just take your programming languages and your natural languages and stick em together in one skills section at the bottom of the page

you need more numbers in your job bullet points, numbers are the best

it's better to _really_ explain 2 projects than it is to just throw 4 up there. what technologies did you use? how? what were the results? etc. You should have at least 2/3 bullet points/project

put numbers on your CCO bullet point to make it sound better (not everyone knows what CCO is) add in junior scores so you can say top 30/3,500 or however many wrote it that year

remove euclid bullet point tbh, unless you have a decent percentile to put in

and a general rule of thumb: if you mention something in your skills section, you should mention it _in a sentence_ somewhere else, either in experience or projects. otherwise as an employer i think you could just be feeding me shit to get through the auto parser

Is it possible to encourage more employers to hold their info sessions at the Bomber? Employers definitely would be coming in at off-peak times for when students would normally go of their own volition. It makes sense in terms of excess capacity. I'm sure some employers aren't even aware they can hold sessions at the Bomber.
That definitely is a far way to drive. Either combine it with other universities or colleges in the area as another user suggested or send out a lot emails and try and watch the live streams/ Q&amp;As that Waterloo does during the fall open house.

That's super different from AC2 and its sequels.  That's more in the mold of a prototypical RPG game.  Progression in the older AC series is very linear and determined.

"Do everything before the lab only leaving space for data, observations, and comments. Literally everything. Section titles, tables, calculations with blanks for the plug'n'chug at the end, even writing out the start of your comments/observations.

Watch some youtube videos by Indian guys about error propagation (this will also help you practice understanding your TA who is guaranteed to not know English). Way too easy to lose marks by ignoring them. If you do enough pre lab work and you watch enough videos it won't be a hassle during the lab either.

All you should be doing during the actual lab is the experiment, writing down data into your tables and calculations, and shitting out stupid explanations about why everything's wrong and you're bad at labs bcuz first year.

I can dm you a bs pre-lab if you don't know what I mean."
"As a quorum check was not called by a Councillor or requested by a Member, it was up to the interpretation of the Speaker (within a reasonable person standard) ... given that a lot of people were checking in online as they left in person it was (in my opinion) reasonable for the Speaker to have thought it was still maintained given that we did begin a bit comfortably above it. 

I would likely have ruled differently if I were in the Speaker's shoes, but I am Secretary, not Speaker (also I was calling in so I wasn't there to see who was in person). 

So all that technicality aside, without quorum having been lost (without a formal check it defers to the prior check which did succeed) then all items of business are valid. Further because Council approved the minutes, decisions made in that meeting were deemed to be valid.

For some items of business -- like the approval of the F.R.W. Referendum (I think that was approved in August but I am a bit foggy) -- it will need to be ratified separately anyhow, so that will be at Council this Sunday. You're free to come and discuss this with Council... but I doubt anyone will oppose the referendum ratification (even on principle) because more than 10k students voted. So if they have personal or constituent opposition they will likely abstain given the decision was entrusted to a referendum."
"&gt; Unironically citing the UN as an authoritative and reputable source

I quoted, I'll repeat it for you:

""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.""

Ok so regardless of which international body made an unironic attempt to codify this into international law, some kind of attempt to bind the idea that all humans deserve freedom and dignity, which is the part that you feel should be disqualified, because you, some pathetic twink at a lowlife school in the middle of abandoned winter thinks should have some authority on who to discount from universal human rights and freedoms?  

Sorry maybe I mispelled ""chink"" as ""twink"", it's possible at UW.

The way you respond makes me think that you look at an idea, figure out who said it, and determine its value based on that.  ie. a complete lack of ability to think critically about anything important or worthwhile.  That's cool, that's why tons of chinks and brownies (but no niggers) are happy to come to UW, forced usually by their parents, but I find it particularly disturbing that you, even if you're a lame blanco/mzungu/gringo from fucking WCI can't see the fucking value in a plainly highlighted statement:

""ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL IN DIGNITY AND RIGHTS.""

Normally I'd invite an idiot like you to suck my dick at this point, but I don't even want your spit on whats left of my foreskin.  I want your fucking asshole to bleed when I'm done with you, maybe leave some juice mixed with whatever kind of shit gets produced from cheap noodles and paninos these days, or the smell of mommie's expired cheques."
"Sorry for your loss. Same thing happened to me last December so I know what you're going through.  I took a 2 hr Uber ride at 3 AM from Waterloo to go to the hospital upon getting the call.  Worst ride ever..

First off, I don't think anyone expects you to go to lectures after learning your mother passed way.  Employees typically take 1-2 weeks grievance leave.  In that case, how is a student supposed to study and learn like nothing happened?  It's unreasonable.  So don't feel bad about missing class.  Although you could have went to class and paid maybe 30% attention instead.

For me, the hardest part was the time between the death and the funeral which was about a week since everything's closed during Christmas time haha...  It was hard to move on knowing there was still a funeral coming up.  I think you're in a much better place already.

As for academic advice, midterms generally don't cover a lot.  Just re-do the assignments and study the lecture notes.  Email the prof for dedicated office hours and justify by briefly explaining your situation.  This will save you maybe 1hr per course since everyone goes to office hours.   I'm in ECE btw so YMMV. 

For now, forget about catching up.  Just catch up to what the midterm covers.  You said your midterms are next week.  That's plenty of time.  I went through ECE hell weeks with just one week studying.  I know you really don't want to study.  But just give it your all for one week (yes, you will have no life).

&amp;#x200B;

Safest choice is to take gap term.

Ideal choice is to study like there's no tomorrow.

"So I'm gonna speak in terms of EngSoc elections, which are different, obviously, but because this is my realm of experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's really hard to force people into doing work. The people who want to do it will run. The best thing we can do is educate people on the position, host info sessions, and make our positions as visible and accessible as possible. 

You can't force a contested election unless you run yourself. Advertisement and accessibility is key, and is something we're \[engsoc\] trying to work on, but at the end of the day, its up to the individuals. "
"You're wrong though. Women care deeply about how they are perceived. Why else would they scream about how great it (supposedly) is to be a slut?

No one goes around screaming about how great it is to be rich or good looking. Only people with genuine problems or shortcomings feel the need to narcissistically broadcast the opposite message to the world.

So bringing back the stigma and shame associated with being a disgusting whore is a good way to stop it. It works well in foreign communities in Canada (Chinese, Indian, Muslims in particular).

"Apologies for getting back to you so late on this. 

I get what you're saying about feeling like you should get a job that relates to the program, and one of the reasons you got it is because of the program itself. But at the end of the day, you'll always have people like this. An example is there are tons of science undergrads who can't get into med school, but two years ago a Laurier BBA did. I think the takeaway is that having a related degree helps, and you'll have an edge for analytics jobs versus somebody without a technical background, but there will always be those rare exceptions. Don't let that one case of your friend beat you down, as there are tons of actual technical majors in the technical roles that they have worked towards during their undergrad.

I honestly think you should take courses based on your interests rather than taking them for a major. If you like ops, take courses that relate to it more purely out of interest, like network flow or scheduling. You don't need to take the more theory based courses if you don't want to pursue the major. I have been told there is a good amount of DDs who don't specialize on the math side, and in your situation, that might be best. I don't know how many math courses you have left to do, but I think it might be worthwhile looking into the various ones and just picking out the ones that are of interest or teach you skills that might get your career where you want to be. If you get a chance to talk to Keith Freeland, he would probably say similar things, as there is no point taking courses that are challenging and that you hate just for more words on your degree (as he puts it).

I relate to the ""not wasting time"" but at the end of the day, if you need that extra time to figure things out, in the long run it will be better. To be honest, taking a year to figure things out but then joining a career path you enjoy are passionate about is better long term than jumping into something you aren't happy about. You'll enjoy work, probably be more driven to climb the ladder, and just be happier overall. If you feel like you need the time, I think you really should take that.

LinkedIn is so far what I've used, though it does take a while. But with the filtered search, or looking at suggestions/mutual connections once you find a few, you'd be surprised how many different people you'd find. "

i still have 2 questions for Part 2 :/ got midterms. About to take the L
"it answers the question 'why me and not someone else'

tbh wasn't joking"
life tip for you: you should also look up what an ad populum argument is
oh god please dont im gonna be in this class and im gonna cringe so hard
rip they finished interviewing yesterday too so i thought there was hope
"think it says ""wind river systems, an intel company"" or something therof"
"this has to be troll.

first faraz, jasfir and now jamal?

so obvious..."
you still have the final.  Do not despair yet.  And its only one course.
"But different schools get better employer rep in coop, for UW theres likely more alumni out there in big tech companies who are able to boost UW recruiting #s and increase UWs employer network. Different schools offer different strengths of connection for different industries. In general outside of coop it doesnt matter though"
"I get the same multiple definition errors when I use gcc 8.1.1, my system GCC. It works for me when I use GCC 3.4, conveniently available in Fedora repos as `compat-gcc-34`. Make sure you `make distclean` and `configure` again after you've set the compiler. `make clean` isn't enough because you need to regenerate the makefile."
"I would talk to UW police, this sounds like theft. If there are cameras in any of those areas, they should be able to check them at those times to try to figure out who was using your card.

Also, you should go to the watcard office immediately to deactivate your old card. Try might even be able to set up a sting or something."
"In addition to what the other person said, for skills I would definitely rearrange the 5+ years experience with Microsoft Word. Just about every student has used the Office suite for assignments and projects, it's basically null. Either take it out or move it to the end, but *definitely* don't keep it as the very first skill. "
"Is it 60 or 70 you need to maintain? Someone else said 70 so just curious about that. And I see, I can imagine how much info you need to take in at the ppl level. So after the ppl course, you’re basically reviewing and building on what you already know, right? I get what you’re saying about the workload, that makes sense !"
"It's $2.50 for a load of laundry and $2 for a load in the dryer. I'm considering moving in and while the other things you've mentioned I can't attest to, I went to the laundry room and saw the units, they charge $2.50 for the laundry and $2 for a load in the dryer. 

Which isn't great, but it's not $5 for a load of laundry :P "
"Just curious, which questions did you find the hardest? It took me awhile to get the 1b (calculating the time being between 2 and 3 minutes) and the Markov Question (returning to state 0).

The elevator one was also pretty weird...I was scrambling for time by then so I just wrote some basic ideas to try and salvage part marks."
"UW is by far the most difficult school in Canada and the pressure that a student goes through in a given year is far greater than you think. Even if a student at UW hasn't had much work experience, on average they're more capable than a kid at any other university in Canada because of the pressure they undergo in a given year."
"We had this talk given to us in Grade 7. Our gym teacher, during health class, ""You guys are hitting puberty. There's nothing worse than a smelly teenager. Tonight, you're all going to ask your parents to get you deodorant. Do an application every morning""

&amp;#x200B;

He was a gem. That should be required in all curricula. "
YES! Its very interesting as the class gets into good discussions and you see other peoples point of view on different topics. The assessments are not hard and relate directly to the books. If you skim through each book again to refresh yourself it will be fine. Super fun course that I actually made an effort not to skip haha.
"Yeah, that's basically what happens, but it works out to max(California tax, Canadian tax) which is approximately equal to Canadian tax (and much less than Canadian + California tax). I roomed with people I knew last co-op and am planning on doing it again this term, but definitely you should do what you think is best for you."
"\&gt;i hear of people skipping a lot and doing well

You'll hear of the one person who skipped and did OK.  You won't hear of the other 99 who skipped and didn't do OK.  Skipping is far more correlated with poor study habits than it is ability to learn outside of class. Source: made that up, but I'm confident that it's true.  "
"Something similar happened to me in Kitchener when I started University in 2010. Not nearly as violent but to this day I still avoid people and cross the street when I see someone in this distance. Even in the day time. One thing that probably saved my life was I had a fake wallet on me. I had literally no money, no phone to give. Just a cheap as fuck MP3 player and a wallet with nothing in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Be safe, always avoid being alone. Also the WatSafe app is good to get on your phone, if it doesn't get stolen. Has a direct line to the campus police and Waterloo Police."
"They consider your choices independently irrespective of whether the same faculty or different ones to my best knowledge.  I have a famiy member who applied for 2 diff programs in the same faculty.  They were accepted to both.  They had enquired about this same question and the response was every program evaluates independently of other programs even if the same faculty.

That is what they were told at a Waterloo student information session at their high school by one of the admissions people.

Can't swear that it is correct but the result seems to validate what they were told."
"Use a sponge. Put the soap on the sponge, make sure to not let the sponge soak in water or get rinsed by the running water while you are doing dishes. Rinse the item you are washing so it's wet, lather it with the sponge with soap on it, rinse off the soap, leave to dry. When the suds from the sponge greatly diminish compared to the beginning, rinse out the sponge and reapply soap.

I have had my bottle of dish soap for over a year now, and I'm about 2/3 done. But then again, my dishwasher washes most of my dishes. When I do dishes by hand, I go through about 1.5 to 2 L a term."
"honestly, a Subaru WRX. It's not the best car in the world, second one i've owned, first was an 06, now I have an 09. Don't think i'd get another one unless it was an 04-05 sti. That being said, it is way better than the BMW in every way. Interior is about the same, but better handling, acceleration, far more reliable (BMWs just blow through head gaskets). The culture/community around it is pretty good too. I'm going to go back to owning a Porsche though. Porsche was the best car I ever owned. That or i might get a Tesla model 3. I should also note, i only ever bought cars used, never new. Only like buying cars cash so the ones i get tend to be older models.Honestly, Doug Demuro has pretty accurate reviews I find, at least for my taste. Check him out on youtube. I don't always agree with what he says, but most of it is on point."
"It's not an educational policy, so it wouldn't be presented in front of the Senate anyway. A few background notes on UW's policy framework (I know you already know a lot of this, but others might find it useful too):

* The [University of Waterloo Act](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/governance/university-waterloo-act) broadly delegates power over the University to three bodies: the Senate (who has authority over admissions, the appointment of the Chancellor, and all matters of educational policy), the Board of Governors (who has authority over student discipline and expulsions, all operational matters except for the things the Senate has power over, and the appointment of the President), and the President (who has all the powers of the Board of Governors when the Board isn't in session, except the ability to appoint the President). The Board of Governors can override the President (or fire the President), but can't interfere in the Senate's business (just as the Senate can't interfere with the Board). Both the Board and the Senate have bylaws which restrict and guide the exercise of their respective powers - Board acting in the interests of the University, Senators acting in the interests of their respective constituencies.

&amp;#x200B;

* The University's *policy framework* is where the Board - via the President - diffuses and restricts various facets of its power. The most important of these is [Policy 1](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-1), which creates several different categories of university policy and sets out the rules for amending those policies. Important to note: Policy 1's own amending formula requires student involvement in the drafting committee (by Feds &amp; GSA), and approval by the Staff Relations Committee and Faculty Relations Committee (who do not have student members) before the President or Board can sign off.

&amp;#x200B;

* The vast majority of University policies are *Class G*, which is to say they don't a) deal with terms of employment for staff and faculty, or b) deal with the appointment of a senior university official (these policies have their own amending formulas because they always require the careful navigating of contractual relations or have a direct impact on the execution of academic policy). Class G policies are purely a guidepost for the exercise of executive power on-campus in its purest form. In practice, they're drafted by committee, but the President possesses the sole authority for the final sign-off, *because ultimately he can and will be held solely responsible by the Board if the policy exposes the University to risk.*

&amp;#x200B;

* There is exactly one category of policy which requires student approval: Class Z policies, which govern the employment of undergraduate or graduate students as teaching assistants or research assistants. The last time I checked (which was a while ago), UW had exactly one Class Z policy.

**Bottom Line:** IMO, there is a VERY reasonable debate to be had about a) student consultation in the development of policies which directly affect them, and b) whether that student involvement could be handled most efficiently under a new class of policy (rather than continuing to overuse the Class G designation), without creating legal risks the President and the Board would find unacceptable. That said, I would question the assertion that this amendment to an existing policy requires a vote in front of the Senate (which should stick to educational policy matters and has its own rules), or the notion that giving the President the sole and final sign-off is necessarily a bad thing."

Make your own cheat sheet. Making the cheat sheet is a good way to help you study and during the exam as you will know exactly where everything on your cheat sheet is and what it is used for. Plus you can target the cheat sheet to the topics you aren't as good at to include previous midterm question and answers for that topic.

"&gt;I hope you went to the TA to discuss it. You can almost always make up grades that way.

Fuck. This. Nonsense. 

TAs are almost always instructed to be generous with grades for undergraduate writing. If you got a really bad grade despite your best effort you either misinterpreted the assignment, or are not good at formulating a cohesive essay.

By all means talk to the TA and see if you can sort it out or get pointers for next time, but don't go in expecting/demanding a bump unless you want your TA to remember you and give your next assignment an especially thorough review. "
"Alum here.  Admittedly my time was a long time ago and the course designation was not the same, but when we did first yr calc and algebra the first thing the profs told us in the very first lecture of each was that their sole goal was to fail as many of us as possible.   Directly, To our faces and not making any bones about it.  And so they did.  And then they belled the marks.

So don't get discouraged.  Its expected that the results are terrible.  Its a tactic.  The wisdom of it is questionable at least in some respects, but its always been this way.

Don't take it personally."
"Don't worry too much my man, last Fall I think a whole lot of people failed the midterm so did I. I got 49 or 39 or something, don't remember.

Try to understand the fundamentals of mechanics because that is all you really need. Solve all the hard questions in the book and practice tests, and be confident. Also, never think you're going to be able to or should be able to solve each and every question on an ECE 105 test the first time, or even at all. "

I have compiled a spreadsheet of individuals who have ""forgotten"" to send me a ""Get-Well-Soon"" e-mail.

"Lol buddy it happened to me twice in 1A and it wasn’t even a big deal. First thing you need to do is contact the prof, admit guilt, preferably go to his office hours and explain the situation with honesty and full truth. 90% of the time they will defer it or let you write a make up if you are sincere. If not, it’s just a midterm, no biggie. There are much bigger things in life to think about and worry about than missing a midterm. Like imagine you are one promo game away from reaching Gold V and suddenly your ADC afks. Now THAT is something to worry about.

"Yea, I'm thinking it's probably going from occasionally buying coffee or withdrawing cash for random things.

It's basically the only fun thing I do.

Le capitalisme est aussi une idée qui a créé une société multiculturelle pour des raisons économiques. Mais je crois que c'est plus facile d'installer une société avec les propres valeurs comme base d'un système de capitalisme avec des règles qui servent le peuple au lieu des banquiers et les globalistes.

C'est vraiment le système de ""corporatism"" comme on dit en Anglais qui est le problème, je crois. Ça nous donne des oligarchies internationalles qui s'en fuit de l'esprit individuel, Dieu, et les connections de communauté homogène."
"- First off, I would ditch the template you're using. Resumes are typically only 2 columns, not 3 like you have currently. The way your sections are also set up makes it looks messy and hard to differentiate between them. A few days again @uwresumecritique, suggested the following [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-resume/bjryvfsjdyxz), which can help you understand proper spacing and having an overseeable resume. I would strongly recommend using a template to clean things up and focus less on using CAPS
- Not sure if it cut it off , but you have a huge blank space under your education. Make sure you include your university/college and some relevant information, such as courses, awards, GPA, and course assignments. Having that information off to the right seems odd so reformat
- Remove the extra-curriculars for your Something Institute. Sports are not that important and the space saved here can be used for more helpful bullet points in your work experience
- Try to break down your professional skills into tools and languages. That's how I see most Engineering/CS students do it and it is easier for recruiters to pinpoint strengths
- Web Developer/Personal Project. The 2 bullet points here are weak and do not give much detail about the work you did. Try to highlight something unique you have on your website or that was difficult to create 
- Team Member/EVS: Bullet points should start with verbs so rephrase your first bullet point here. Re-write it to focus around what kind of a tool you developed. Your second bullet point is a little vague and isn't a unique skill per-say. Try to give a specific example with a positive outcome to show your strength. Be specific about the project management skills you applied here. Your third bullet point is waaaay too long and sounds like 3 condensed into one. Choose one main and important thing to focus on

If you're gonna have waited staff, they should probably come around and check on people so people can buy food. If you're not gonna do that and instead have people order at the bar, that should be clear to customers."
"&gt; ""Feel like I'm living in China"" is a statement that feels slathered in racism.

Well, it does feel like I'm living in China when everyone around me is speaking Chinese, looks Chinese, the restaurants are majority Chinese etc..  how is that racist? Because I notice the discrepancy with the rest of Canada and the first ~20 years of my life?

&gt; Whether you think it is or not, you don't get to define the hard line between racist and not-racist. It's like pornography. You know it when you see it. Everyone else sees it.

Color me surprised that you have porn on your brain ��

&gt; You and I were even lucky enough to be born here. I didn't do anything to earn this, I just showed up and held my hands out.

My family has been here for 400 years. I'm not having this stupid conversation about how we're all immigrants yadda yadda.

&gt; So I don't know who you're complaining too.

"&gt; You realize there's a progression to that point, right?

Yes my dear, there is progression, but it's almost always private.  It is not a long string of online posts or wherever it may happen to be that you live our your life.  It's private.  When suicide happens, it leaves the people closest to that person wondering deeply ""Why?"" - there is no obvious string of causality, the ""progression"" of which you speak.  

&gt;. Hurting yourself doesn't always mean suicide attempts, it can also be self-mutilation

I appreciate your PSA didactivism.  Do you mean something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/y1IMw6Z.jpg)?  This guy, I bet you 1000 grivna he won't kill himself, because it's too public, too much ""progression"".  Same like the posts here, snowflake.  I mean if Vadim does end up offing himself, it's possible, but it would be a first in that format for me.  First in that pattern.  I have 3 friends who've killed themselves, /u/plumt, how many do you have?  Add in friends of family maybe 7?  Argument from authority is bullshit and anecdotes are equally bullshit but, at some point, my dear, a pattern emerges.  Right?  Which leads me to the next comment you made:

&gt; if you feel it coming over you

Do you say this from personal experience?  Have you ever successfully commited suicide?  You think a mentally ill person takes a time out and goes ""hmm I suspect I am becoming dangerously ill now... perhaps I should reflect on my condition and consider the differences between campus police and a health care practioner like 24/7"".  

i have been committed to a psych ward 3 times, twice involuntarily via form 1, your assumptions are exactly that: assumptions and have no basis in reality.  I commend you for hoping and being positive, however.

&gt; You can sense when your mind is heading to a bad place

lol, what bullshit.  You must be 16.  But dismissiveness aside, see above, [your assumptions are immature and naiive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog).

&gt; This victim-blaming, invalidating, dismissive behaviour towards someone who is not in a great place is disgusting,

Thanks SJW.  I am however utterly correct, sadly and disgustingly correct, and if only you could come with me this week and count the dead bodies, you'd know that I'm fucking right on correct.  Why don't you like my take on reality?  Maybe cause you're young, or inexperienced, which is basically the same thing, or maybe you have some hopeful idea about the world the same way physicists used to think string theory is a good idea.  Why you throw chip, bitch?  

&gt; before looking at your post history.

A reddit post history is a collection of garbage.  Come visit me right now right here where I am here, and say the same fucking thing to my face, anonymous bitch.

&gt; For someone who claims to understand human behaviour, it's ironic as hell.

What's ironic?  Explain your position if you have one.

&gt; But I'm guessing by human behaviour, you mean some retarded ""redpill"" philosophy.

I only loosely know what redpill is because of this backwater fucking autist school.  Where the fuck do you connnect anything about what I said regarding suicide and mental health with red pill?  Once again wtf am I even bothering engaging with a kid like you.

&gt; Get a fucking grip, incel.

Yeah I realize I delete my post history on a regular basis but 'incel' is the wrong word here, my dude."

"You know how interviewers usually start out with some spiel about their company and what they do and what's special about them? Ask questions about that.

"&gt; What I witnessed was one current exec and one skilled player at my table not only doing this, but being very condescending towards the bad plays made by the beginners.

This was my experience as well, I definitely saw this attitude towards players that were even more inexperienced than myself. I'm not looking for any hand holding, but if I've got an exec and others going in on me for making a ""bad play"", that I ""wouldn't have made if I knew what I was doing"", it's just not worth my time to go there.

Much appreciate your comment, nice to know I'm not the only one who noticed."
"A) I only yell in public when I'm with good friends and want to embarrass them or myself. I mostly adjust my actions to best suit the group of people I'm currently with.

B) I don't do drugs, and if I ever go to a party I usually prefer get togethers of 20 people or less.

C) I don't think I've ever done this. I usually try something I know I would enjoy.

D) My shoes are always retied when i put them back on.

E) I try to always have a serving of fruit or vegetables throughout the day whether its with dinner or just as a snack. Personal favorites include raspberries and broccoli."
"1. Submit VIF asap for her migraine (make it sound like it was so bad she was unable to focus etc etc) - go to the walk in doc (they are open today at the plaza but not Sunday). Submit it and she can defer the weight of her exam to her final. Unfortunately that means her final will be worth the original weight + 35%, but that means she really needs to study well for finals. 

2. I understand she may have her own personal situation/issue going on and maybe she may have reacted too sensitively to what you said. But as her bf, you should KNOW that and NOT push her emotionally before she has an important exam. That is your own fault for doing that. 

She should also look into ways to reduce stress, go to counselling, etc. As her bf I think you should help her out with coping strategies and just support with her academics and stress.

"Not really. But you can think so if it helps you sleep at night. Notice I said a ""decade ago"", hence not ""modern climate change"" by definition. It changes rapidly. You wouldn't know that since you were like 8 years old then.

Hate to break it to you, but there are more important things in Canada than climate change. Especially since we barely have a fucking carbon footprint on a global scale.

Canada's population is like a big city in China. ��

You fell hook, line and sinker for Trudeau's magic show. Keep focusing on global climate change while he ruins the country smh

Harper did nothing wrong and steered us through the 2008 depression pretty well. It's not up to the government to legislate morality and non-violent ""inequality"" or ""exclusion"" in my view so I don't really fucking care what he did other than fiscal policies. I *know* what he did, I lived through it, but I just don't care. The consequences are so incredibly minuscule that it's just not worth my time to take them into account.

Actually if Harper did one thing wrong, it was allowing so much immigration from China."
"&gt;Well, it does feel like I'm living in China when everyone around me is speaking Chinese, looks Chinese, the restaurants are majority Chinese etc.. how is that racist? Because I notice the discrepancy with the rest of Canada and the first ~20 years of my life?

How is that racist? Because it's blatantly obvious to anyone reading this that you're angry that there are Chinese immigrants in the same town as you.

Racism has a two main components:

1. The main focus is race.

2. Negative emotion. Hate, anger, displeasure, etc.

If I am angry at a group of people and the only reason I'm angry is *directly related to their race and culture*, then whether I feel so or not, I'm exhibiting racism.

I don't have to intend it and I don't have to attack anyone directly (though attacking would make it exponentially worse). It's still racism.

And before you jump down my throat, this doesn't just apply to racism. I'm not branding everything as racism, sexism, whateverism just to be a social justice warrior.

**Everything you do and say has an effect on other people in the room, and it doesn't matter your intent, it matters what they feel and hear.**

Hear out a completely racism-free example:

At work I'm giving a presentation to a project team. I'm trying to sell my new idea and I'm trying to keep everyone's attention with a strong voice and making some specific points about what we've been doing wrong lately.

An hour after the presentation, my boss pulls me aside and tells me ""Hey, you came off as really rude in there and I got complaints about some of the team members about it. If you want to earn their trust and respect, you'll need to tone it down a bit.""

Do I think I was rude? Not really. That wasn't even my intention *but that doesn't make my boss wrong about me being rude.* If my presentation made a few people complain about my manners, then *there was a real issue*. If one person thought so then I shrug it off and watch my tongue.  If two or more say something, it's my fault.

Returning to the topic of racism, just because you don't think something is racism doesn't mean you're correct."
"Honestly just browsing reddit alone will help you get a lot of references, although it's a bit weird that you listed Elon Musk (right after saying you don't know much about people) since he's frequently mentioned on posts that reach the front page...

Eg: Recently the head of interpol went missing in China (although it was now confirmed he was arrested or something there). I met up with a guy I never met before with a few others and at some point he mentioned that story. Even though I didn't know anything about Interpol, I was able to chime in just because I saw a reddit post about it and skimmed through the top comments. Idk how bad your focusing abilities are, but seeing as how you mentioned you mindlessly scroll through the internet you could probably pick up on tidbits here and there. Eventually those small pieces of information add up to your arsenal of references. 

Beyond that, I wouldn't force myself to watch movies like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars (and I haven't). While they do come up fairly often, most people don't spend a lot of time talking about them, and even if they do you could easily chime in by mentioning things like ""oh I heard the LoTR movies are 13 hours long in total, that's crazy!"" or ""haha I have never watched those movies before"" and watch their reactions to your ""shocking"" claims.

The final point I'll say is something you'll often read on Reddit: people love talking about themselves, so make them do that. If they watch those movies and frequently bring them up, ask them questions about it. Why do they find it interesting? Where should a beginner start (for things like Star Wars)? Even if you don't intend to watch them. Or if they talk about whether you heard of Y person, tell them ""no I haven't. Have they done something interesting recently?"". You need to know when to strike a balance though, don't just berate them with questions; if you can relate at some point and the time is right then go ahead and chime in. You won't come off as ignorant for not knowing things - you'll come off as ignorant if you seem like you don't care about what people are saying.

"Hey /u/OHlookABoard, I'm a bit biased here since I was on the General Meeting's ordered Task Force for GM Engagement &amp; Council Reforms, but think the current direction is one seeking improvement (ie. current form in governance structure is weak and not accountable to our members).

# Do students really control Feds?

Every year we hear issues ""how can 200 people make a decision for 32000"" at the Winter GM and Fall AGM. As the staff support for Feds grows (ie as members want more things from Feds) the ownership and accountability to members of the operations and governance grows weaker. By that, I mean that the organization becomes less accountable to members and members can impact the operations and actions of the Federation less easily. [Here is a good graph of that phenomenon](https://imgur.com/a/YLOckmL) from *A Blueprint for Student Driven, Professionally Supported Student Associations February 20, 2015*. This problem is kind of compounded as membership grows (as student enrollment grows). So member voting power and ""ownership"" becomes more diffuse ... and that in turn means student control over feds is far weak than it should be. 

# Proposed Bylaw reforms aim to course correct these trends

The AGM ([agenda here](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/2018_feds_agm_agenda.pdf)) this year is aiming to fix this. Some bylaw reforms that were ordered to be made by the Fall 2017 AGM's aim to:

* Increase accountability of the Board to your elected representatives on Council and just generally you as members, 

* Make it easier to recall and remove poor Directors and Councillors and Exec -- do to this we are lowering the recall threshold to be *10% or 500 of the constituency* instead just 10% for Councillors and Execs; and for Directors, we are reducing the removal threshold to be 50%+1 at a GM or Council rather what it is currently where it can occur only at a GM called for that purpose with 2/3 voting to remove.

* Allowing online applications for Directors and clarifying the role of Board as being corporate focused and accountable to elected student government. 

* Allowing online proxy submission and voting for General Meetings.

* And just generally bringing the organization's bylaws into compliance with the Corporations Act.

And some more changes separate from the bylaws -- in procedure and policy -- that will require termly Town Hall meetings without ""Robert's Rules"" to allow Q&amp;A with Councillors, Executives, and Directors and allow recommendations to be made by members easily without many technical barriers.

# How does this fix the problem?

By strengthening the accountability of the corporate side of Feds to the student government side (your directly elected Council), students have more month-to-month oversight of Feds instead of just that information which the Board permits to be brought to the General Meeting once or twice a year. 

Also opening up Directorship via an online application lets anyone apply to be on the Board and get elected into that position, not just those people who bring 20 friends out to the Winter General Meeting to get elected."

"The results of the Fall Reading Week are getting ratified by the Students' Council on October 21st (a few days before the AGM). 

Because there's the Okanagan Charter Town Hall from the University right after the Feds AGM things are a bit tight (time wise) and so that was set to Council for ratification -- which is also allowed and makes some sense since Council initiated the referendum and wrote the questions.

The ratification of referenda results only goes on a GM agenda _if applicable_, which in this case since Council is ratifying it, is not. I hope this answers your question!"
"Hi,

I'm a 4th year Health Studies student, and am, by no means, a bio student. I have, however, seen the ups and downs of a few courses in the Science faculty.

That midterm on Thursday was *far* from unfair.

The content that he tested us on was, for the most part, available in the content provided AND taught in lecture. I definitely had a few questions that I felt lost on or didn't know the answer right away for, but most were either right from lecture or from the clicker questions done in class. I found that 50% of the questions were quick answers right from the material, 15-20% had me stuck between two or three answers (as a good m/c exam should), and maybe 30-35% were from things I just ***did not*** study.

Now, I know I have some benefits from being later in my degree, but that also means I know what a truly unfair exam looks like.
Neufeld has been a great prof for this course thus far, and I'm sure that you might just be feeling spooked because he did a good job of testing our knowledge on such a diverse field. 

Just have faith and wait for the grades. This isn't the end.

"Well IMO even if it's not emotional cheating you gotta ask ur SO to evaluate if them saying like ""Hey thanks"" instead of ""Hey thanks UWU &lt;3 &lt;3"" (or whatever they send to their friend) is worth more to them than ur feelings. If stickers and stuff are something that really make them happy you can maybe just ask them to cut out the romantic-ish ones like the hearts? Like I don't see that as controlling at all because hearts are a pretty common romantic symbol. Ur SO shouldn't be knowingly doing things that upset you because being in a relationship is about caring for each other. "
"Yeah, king and uni should be a pedestrian scramble. 

&gt;it’s been mostly forgotten about.

Seriously? dt kitchener pretty recently did a tonne of work to turn king into a low speed zone with generous sidewalks and bollards and king has sidewalks on both sides all the way to the highway. 

&gt;Midtown is basically a dead zone.

What would you do to improve that? It's not a sidewalk or streetscape issue, it's a ""there's nothing there"" issue. Midtown is all generic low rise commercial and converted residentials filled with professional services and dentists. How would streetscape improvements there result in a QoL improvement for region residents? 

Meanwhile the cross streets (Uni between bridge and weber, Bridgeport, Erb, Wellington, Victoria) are engineered for people to drive 80 and really unfriendly to pedestrians and cyclists."
"Hi /u/funfucker77, I consult science students and just general students through a few means:

* I work closely with the Science Society's Board of Directors and Executives to hear issues from the club level (like Phys or Chem Club) to issues at the Faculty level.

* I've held events in STC and other science buildings with the other science Councillors to chat one-on-one about what we're working on and get feedback ([you can check out my caucus report on the agenda if you're interested in the most recent such event I've done!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18-tTV1KP73noDYpvo_5t2kIXjCNVtCV7))

* I do consult my friends, but also clubs I am part of as well. I am sure people probably get pissed about me always asking Feds or Uni related issues... but I am in the German &amp; Slavic Society, I used to serve on Arts Student Union as a German program rep and I regularly maintain those connections, I also am on an advisory committee for a few conferences around campus so that's another avenue for discussion.

* The Science Councillors collectively put out surveys once or twice a term on major issues and some minor ones and notice for meetings. For reference, I've gotten between 30 and 700 people participating in various surveys about Feds, Science Faculty, and Uni related matters.

* As secretary I've put out articles in Feds News &amp; Updates and receive emails. I also put out my email for students who want to reach out themselves.

* Finally, I am on the reddit page pretty often and try to participate diligently.

There's probably more but I can't think of anything else immediately."
"This should *definitely* only be one pages to start. Two pages, especially for a first co-op is overkill and will reflect badly since it looks like you can't figure out how to highlight what is important/relevant VS what is not. Also the format is very simple and plain, and there's not enough differentiation between titles, sections and the body content. 


Professional Profile

- I think the major issue here is how unrelated these skills are. Depending on what you're applying to (you've mentioned advertising/marketing), working with a cash register or children are basically entirely irrelevant. This is the first thing people are reading on your resume, so you want to make sure it's as relevant to the position as possible. Highlight things like business skills, prior marketing experience, writing &amp; communication, etc. that will be relevant to the position.
- If you want to highlight other skills in more detail, make mention of them in your cover letter

Education

- Your relevant course list is too long, especially for being only in 2A. Employers have access to your transcript, and it's still early in your degree (so your knowledge base is still broad) so I would omit these for now. Same with the current project blurb.
- Highschool can be omitted

Certifications

- Again I would only mention these if they are relevant to the job(s) you're applying to, otherwise they're just fluff and take up space

Activities and Interests

- I wouldn't use more than one bullet for this; I would just mention things like piano, singing, travelling, etc. in a list form rather than vertical bullet form"

"&gt;I simply find it disconcerting that people feel so threatened by the very idea of people who are white having a heritage...

Nope, no one is threatened by that. It is silly to call it ""white heritage"" because that isn't a thing. English, French, German, Israeli, Greek, Turkish, South African, Australian, Swiss, etc., heritage is what the terms are. 

&gt;I'm neither of those things, not German either.

Then you should understand the foolishness of ""white heritage"".

&gt;There is very real social pressures (for numerous reasons) that discourages people from having children and encourages people to instead expend energy socializing people into their way of doing things by other means. How else can you explain the unsustainable below replacement birth-rates which is clearly a mark of a failing society.

That isn't due to some political/media conspiracy to make white people not have babies. It is a simple side effect of women receiving and education and wanting to participate in the workforce.  The same effect is present in Japan as an example. You also see the effect in a lot of developing nations as the birth rate drastically falls as women education/workforce participation goes up.

"Hey, don't feel bad for your feelings, they're actually not uncommon! here's a couple ideas just off what you've said here:

Some people would take these feelings and relate them to either asexuality or aromanticism. I won't make any assumptions about the first one since you didn't say anything about that, but being aromatic basically means laking the desire to have romantic bonds or interactions with people. That does not mean people who define themselves this way choose to never have relationships, but they may just be a little less traditional or feel like they are not meeting the requirements of what a ""real happy relationship"" should be. of course i'm making huge assumptions here without much knowledge about you, but if this sounds even a little relatable to you i'd encourage you to do a little research or reach out to people in the ace/aro community for advice or experiences (i'm pretty sure they have a sub). see if there's anything about it you relate to that can help you resolve some of your feelings.

It's also possible that you just have not met someone you have made a deep connection with, or you just need a little more time to warm up to people! this is super common and you don't have to feel weird or bad for not liking people. love, strong bonds, and relationships take time to cultivate. feel free to pm if you want to chat!"

All i know is that my friend took the in-class version in the same term when i took the online version and what he was doing seemed way more difficult. Since then ive told a few friends to take it as an elective and everyone who did it online said it was easy while the people that did it in-class said it was not a bird course at all.
"Alright so it's hard for a lot of upper years to confirm what the hardest term is as of now because they changed the course schedule for a lot of the newer students (I believe this applies to class of 2021 and forwards). As an ECE 2020, the hardest term in terms of time management would have been 2A and material wise, probably 2B/1B."

"I looked at the spreadsheet breakdown and I'm a bit confused. 

~&gt;Why is the Bomber Bar segment unprofitable? Are drinks being sold below cost?

Is it possible to get a bit more of a breakdown, because this is still quite vague."
"I serve with Oliver on Feds' Council and on a few education/government advocacy and policy committees with Feds/UW. He's an excellent councillor and a good guy. I genuinely hope he gets elected because he cares tremendously about doing what's right for students.

"I think this is fine, though be aware that if they reach out to your employer and ask about this you can be caught in an awkward lie. Giving a higher salary might also damage your salary if that employer is not willing to pay that amount. Some employers can be shallow and will choose a candidate simply because they're asking for less"
I’m not an incel. I’m just now open to the harsh truth. I used to care about trying to find the perfect girl but recent experiences made me realize it’s a lie concocted. I have dated women but it’s all a matter of resource extraction since I’m not good looking or tall enough for those relationships to had been more healthy.
Right on the money. These new by-law changes if passed will begin to implement general meeting online voting so that students not on campus or on coop away from UW can vote too while the meeting is in progress. Eventually I'd hope we make it possible for students to vote online beyond classroom hours as well as during meeting hours. 
"The board is responsible for commercial services and from my understanding they review them annually. Unfortunately since it's confidential, we don't have any insight as Councilors.

"I think you’re pretty much dead on with drawing the line at promising and failing to deliver. The only problem is that the word implicitly blurs that line. I’ve been on the receiving end of ‘men are trash’-esque comments a couple of times and I believe it was because of not only my own poor decisions, but also because of what the girls thought I had *implicitly* promised. Reasonably or not, to these girls, sex carried the implicit promise of a relationship into the foreseeable future. So I guess I’m not disagreeing, but offering an explanation of the thinking of some people."
"If this isn't another shitpost :

You've been at school for like a month. Everyone's grades drop from high school, especially at an insane university like MIT. Maybe you just need to develop a different method of studying that works for your classes. 

You also have No Record grading for your first term at MIT don't you? Don't worry so much about early grades - worry more about improvement. Eventually your grades should get better if you are doing the right things - take this opportunity to explore what study methods work for you.

If you got into MIT, you can probably do well at MIT."
"The cartels are only violent because the government was the first to react with violence which in turn spawned gangs.

The biggest difference between the dealers and the government is that with dealers you have a CHOICE on whether to purchase their product, while with government you are forced to pay for (most) services you may not want/need.

To your point, the rest of the world isn't any better with regards to governmental services. Ultimately the major issue is simply that it only takes 50% of a population of idiots to decide where your money goes, and you can't do shit about that."
"This happened to my class about 2 years ago, the class average for the first midterm was about 48%, I got around 20%...

My prof told us all afterwards that most classes do poorly on that test because it's a brand new type of math and you aren't really used to thinking like that. Looking back in a month, you'll feel like an idiot for not understanding all that stuff, but it takes time. 

If it helps, the Stat 333 final is probably the easiest math final I've written here, and I've written way too many math finals now that I'm in 4B stats, and Stat 433 was probably my favourite course."
"This question is bullshit and i would be livid if this was my 'quiz'. This is the type of question that you get so many different ranges depending on the source. A quick google search gets like 5 different ranges (none are the ranges in this question) and although these sources arent exactly reputable, a quick search through a few published papers would probably result in a fuck ton of different ranges. I know the prof wants the answer thats given in the textbook or given by their notes, but if it was literally just 1 little thing from the notes like OP is suggesting then like wtf??? "
"a) I haven't graduated yet b) I can't speak for non CS/Software (I'm CS myself) but

2. **Is it bad:** Not sure what you mean by this? The social life isn't as easy as other schools but it's really all up to you to make your experience. You'll meet some incredibly smart people here. 

3. **Coop:** Yes, I'm currently in my third co-op actually. AMA?"
"��so good to hear aw, are there particular topics in physics that interest you the most? (Also is that 4th year of reg or coop version?)

Hm idk about neat but if its still light out I like to read a bit sometimes, usually watch a bit of something on netflix before I go to sleep if my eyes aren't too tired, random little yoga/meditation/exercise/stretching sessions to foreign folk music or country etc if I can get away w it without complaints�� aww I love hearing people play on them, what are your specialities?  it's such a shame so many of the outdoor ones got rain damage :(("
"I paid for all my stuff with my scholarships + co-op and I can spend my money however I want so i don't really see this as spoiled? I don't actually spend that much money on random things either, it's like 10-15% of how much money I get which is like, a reasonable amount IMO for fun things since I don't have debt or anything. If the ability to spend my own money on things that I want makes me entitled then well, I guess I am but I don't see that as a problem lol.

Like some people want to focus on studying so they don't bring loads of stuff and that's cool. I'll burn out if I do that so I bring all the things i need/want to make my life easier/more fun and for my hobbies.  And I also don't like having to rely on other people to borrow their stuff so I own my own stuff like microwave, stand mixer, toaster, kettle, iron/ironing board, vacumn, AC unit, etc which is like the bulk of it. It's too annoying being like ""hey can I drive to ur house to borrow ur iron"" to someone every time I have a presentation or interview lol.  

I'm not a hoarder - none of this stuff impacts other aspects of my life and I'm not sentimentally attached to like 95% of it either. Most people usually have more than a single car full of stuff with them - thats why moving vans are a thing people use even when they're living in places that provide basic furniture...

"My time at Waterloo finished a long time ago (mid-80s) so no I did not have Mansour! 

Your comments on his teaching style are something you should bring to the faculty chair or student ombudsman or whatever passes for student recourse now - specifically: "" His teaching style also includes skipping key concepts and intuition, as  well as sloppily working through examples. His lectures are very  disorganized and confusing, "" along with the part about taunting students.

These are indicative of a poor course leader.   As I noted above, in my day they did due their damn best to fail us but it was not on the premise of a horrible prof teaching badly although some were also that. 

If he has already told everyone you are all going to fail and the class will be curved then take it at face value and don't take it personally (very hard I know given how much is riding on this for each of you).  Master what you can comfortably, and move on to what else is impt in the semester.  

You all might even be caught in the crossfire.  Some profs love to teach and thrive on lecturing first year courses.  Others hate it, drew the short straw and are making a point to the administration that this is a waste of their time and don't do it again.  It sounds like you have a prof who is badly prepared and probably did not want to be teaching this.

You’re really doing this last minute. When I was collecting references for professional school, I planned to socialize with them a full 8 months before deadline. Spent four months getting to know em, got the references by the fifth month and stored it on interfolio (so I could always access them even after deadline). "
"no prof is gonna take that as a valid excuse for her mark. unfortunately, private lives and academic performance have little justifiable overlap (in the sense that one can be used to sometimes excuse the other)

&amp;#x200B;

this is simply a mistake on both your parts, tbh. you shouldnt have said something upsetting to your gf, and she should not have taken it to heart so close to her examination/let it ruin her mark. maybe the health services thing can help a little, not too sure on that. the main thing to do now is accept that it went wrong and keep trucking on forward

"Put your books on your desk. Have a calendar with due dates on the wall. Set reminders on your phone. Keep stuff out in the open where it's visible to you. I find it's a lot easier to get lost in retrospection when shit is tucked away in your bag, out of sight out of mind, and there aren't any visual reminders of your responsibilities out in the open. Other things like having a study buddy can keep you on track by adding an extra layer of commitment. Shuffle your routine, change your study spots, keep things from getting boring. 

You could see a professional to learn mindfulness techniques or get over and process what you've experienced in a healthy way. Maybe having someone to talk to and deconstruct that stuff will keep you from ruminating about it for an extended period. Book an appointment with counselling services and give it a go"
"Genetics are so important in deciding one's attractiveness because heterosexual people are biologically urged to mate with people who have good genes. It's not really arbitrary in my opinion.

Many factors of one's attractiveness relate to health, which is why exceedingly skinny or fat individuals are typically seen as less attractive. Many other undesirable traits such as acne, facial asymmetry and physical disabilities are potentially indicators of poor health.

Conversely, physical fitness is desirable since it indicates good health.

Shortness and physical weakness in men are seen as unattractive because men are traditionally ""protectors"" of women (obviously this is far from the case in a modern society, but genetics are genetics). This is also why men typically do not care as much about a woman's height or musculature.

One's taste in music or texting ability is only really important after developing am initial attraction. An ugly person with excellent taste in music and superb texting skills will remain ugly, while an attractive person will be attractive regardless of those things."
"I've heard this from your FEDS leaders often over the last year or so.

This corridor currently is designed to move cars. Lots of them. As quickly as possible. As long as that's the vision for the road, the Region's warranting process won't say a traffic signal is warranted at University/Lester.

We've got a visioning process underway for University Ave in cooperation with the Region, who own the road, and the three post-secondary institutions on it. ([https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/university-avenue-gateway-streetscaping-design-study.asp](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/university-avenue-gateway-streetscaping-design-study.asp))

I'm hopeful we can get agreement that the University Ave corridor should be about creating great places and for moving people, however they travel, which would mean higher priority to pedestrians, transit, and cyclists. 

That would change how intersections like University/Lester are viewed, and the Region may then look much for favorably on requests to add traffic signals or other pedestrian crossing infrastructure. 

I'm on board. City staff are on board. I don't yet know where the Region is, and since it's their road, they need to be on board. 

So I'd say it is important to participate in the process and ask your Regional Councillors to support a different approach to how University Avenue works."

"If you just want it for a couple years lease it so you dont need to deal with getting rid of it later.

"Weed gives you a major buzz, which if you train yourself you can turn into all the things you said alcohol gives you. I do the same thing and its perfect.

My advice is to smoke in situations you would normally drink (parties, clubs, bars) and your perception of weed might change, I certainly know mine did. I think weed is more powerful of a drug than people make it to be, and as such should only be taken in certain situations"
"What I remember about the CS135 midterm exam is :

1. writing a function using helper functions. One question is divided into sub-questions and each question asks you write a helper function. Maybe the last sub-question will be writing a wrapper function for the helpers.
2. simplify nested or inefficient cond statement. This is not easy. 
3. design a struct data structure and write functions to use the struct.

Most questions are to write functions. Midterm is not hard. It is designed to get you 1st year students used to CS exam. But you will find that final is brutal. 

Good luck guys!"

"\&gt;I'll take 600 app : 30 interviews to 50 WW app : 10 interview any day

Assuming it takes idk around 4-5 minutes per application (including searching and filtering) 550 applications is a difference of 37-45 hours. That's a lot of time for preparation around 3-4 hours a day for 2 weeks.

With the right studying techniques, you can make significant progress in that time and increase your chances of getting an offer drastically."
"Agreed, I'll definitely leave that education section off for now but it will show up in my future career.

I honestly have *too much* to say with respect my previous positions; I enjoy what I do and I could defend my resume points and my technical decisions more than adequately in an interview, but that's besides the point. I've covered so much ground and I've intentionally touched on so many topics at work that I can't fit them all into 4 bullet points! 

I will think about tailoring my resume and highlighting what I think is most relevant to my employer for sure.

"Don't catastrophize. It's a cognitive distortion. Your future is definitely not going to be defined by some intro uni labs. If you're interested, self-administered CBT can be very helpful. [This](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Depression) is a collection of modules and self-help resources. Consider going to campus counselling, or health services if medication is helpful. Might seem like overkill but you need to nip this type of thinking in the bud because school will only get more rigorous with time and you can't afford to spiral. 

As for academics, keep close with peers and attend group studies if you find collaborative environments helpful. If you're having trouble learning concepts there's [drop-in](https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/drop-in-tutoring) tutoring for a variety of subjects. But maybe you do have a good grasp of what you're learning. Sometimes it really just comes down to bad luck and getting caught off guard. Over the course of undergrad, one lab, one course, barely influences your cumulative average. It's okay! Relax. Good luck :):):)"
"Expecting life to be like the movies and novels = high expectations that will never be met. 

Most people never get to experience ""all that life has to offer"" because there's too much out there to try. Life requires you to make choices and set priorities. Right now your choice/priority is higher education (versus taking a gap year, raising a family, backpacking across Europe, etc.). Be kinder to yourself, and stop comparing yourself to others (especially fake others). 

I know a few people who tried to live the Hollywood college movie lifestyle - and wasted a ton of money and flunked out. To them, ""wasting their youth"" = missed opportunities that affected their career prospects. Frankly, I think the idea that ""these are the best years of your life"" is a myth and a rather sad one. There's so much out there to do and experience - growing old is a privilege. 

I agree with others that you might want to talk to a doctor. Maybe you need to see a counsellor, or maybe you're vitamin or iron deficient.

Good luck!  Trust me, these aren't the best years of your life ;) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
"I should clarify.  I did not mean ""lead"" in the motivational sense but rather lead in context of guiding generally through the topical material.  Better ones actually do teach in that context, others just throw up some info and then leave the students gasping at all the material around the info that they still need to find and learn.

Without rehashing the theory of education right here I will just say there is a purpose to this.  Its seeing who can bridge the gap from simply following formulas/instructions and regurgitating, and instead make the intuitive leaps necessary for resolving complex problems which may initially not have an evident set series of instructions to resolve.  This will become much more prevalent in 3rd and 4th year in some programs. 

Anyways my advice to the OP or anyone in this situation is don't try to learn everything at the last minute.  Prioritize.  Run a check list and master what you can and what you know you can't leave.  After mids time to play catch-up and hit up the prof in office hours.  Maybe also see if you can find a tutor.

 And good luck to you all."
"Required materials: Two [dish washing brushes](https://www.google.com/search?q=dish+washing+brushes&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi67N-pwJ3eAhUCI6wKHRzzBBsQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=658&amp;dpr=1.5#imgrc=DrknLr9RZhzx2M:). Brush A is the older one. Brush B is the newer one. Dish washing soap. 

Step 1: Rinse the dishes using warm water to remove most of the debris. Utilize Brush A. 

Step 2: The rinsed dishes are now sitting beside the sink in nice, neat, autistic friendly piles. Use Brush A and perhaps a dollop of dish soap to clean the inside of the sink and wash the gunk out. 

Step 3: If there is a metallic filter thing (recommended) remove it and dump its contents in the garbage. 

Step 4: Turn the water on hot, wait until hot just beneath the point of unbearable and insert the plug thingie to fill the sink. Immediately put in a few good squirts of soap and direct the water stream at it so that it gets mixed in nicely. 

Step 5: Turn off the water when the sink is full enough, then grab the first thing you are going to wash and begin scrubbing it in methodological circular motions which cover the entire dish. Start with the cleanest dishes and work your way to the dirtiest ones. Place each dish in a drying rack or on a drying cloth once it is cleaned (no visible debris, no dirtying of water, or you covered all of it - whichever comes last). 

Step 6: If you have a lot of dishes, or there was some sort of grease that warm water didn't wash away, then you may need to return to step 2 if the water becomes too dirty. 

Step 7: Dry and put away. Wash your drying cloth at least once a week

&gt;dish soap 2 terms

Not going to happen, it's pretty cheap and you should probably be going through a bottle every couple weeks. I think I went through 5 or 6 bottles in one term so you're probably not using enough soap if it takes you two months to finish. 

&gt;Additional tips

Some types of greasy foods stick in the brushes and you need to make sure you clean the brushes if there is grease/gunk sticking in the bristles. If the container had old/decomposing food or the dish brush is really gunky and won't clean, I think you can sit those in a dilute solution of something called jabix? Also do what u/MoondyneMC said and soak the dishes if you aren't planning to rinse it immediately after eating from it.

"There's 2 sides to this *(that I've experienced)*: CECA/Everything Else

"When you face adversity and setbacks in life, will you continue to run? Did you really give it your all? Did you change your bad study habits and try to learn the material more deeply?

"as a phd student, you are doing all the work. The contributions from the supervisor may vary, they could have done nothing besides pay the phd's salary, or provide some suggestions, or actually be hands on leading the research project. given that Dr. Strickland is first author here leads me to believe that she did majority of the work. "
"No, I mean degree of how much you shared. For example, the [245 policy](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs245/) states that you should come away from the discussion without any written or electronic records (and that you should acknowledge the conversation). I believe this would also apply to conversations where you may as well have had written records: things like you writing a function as a group, then 2 minutes later each of you write the function independently for the assignment. However, collaborating to determine what strategy to use (or not use), and the overall idea is fine."
"When you say Faculty average do you mean the minimum required average? If you check the academic calendar for your program/major, there will be minimum average progression requirements (usually something like 60-65% major average, depending on your major). If you're above this, you're fine. Otherwise, you'll likely be put on probation for the following term to raise your average. If your average is still below the minimum after a probational term, usually an advisor will reach out to you with next steps (i.e. switch programs, take some time off, petition, etc. depending on circumstances)"
"If Council is so explicit about ""allowing"" future referenda on this issue, why not actually encode that stance in policy 48 instead of just talking about it but not putting it into policy?

Also, when you use language like Council ""allowing"" a referendum on an issue, that's exactly the attitude this imprint article is talking about. Referenda are the most direct expression of students, moreso than council and even moreso than a general meeting. Having done terms on council before before, I recognize that council has to massage referenda to make sure referenda results can be advocated by Feds. But when an organization that is supposed to ""serve, empower, and represent"" is only ""allowing"" the students it represents to call referenda, and even encoding extra barriers to that in policy, the legitimacy of Feds as a representative body suffers."
"Try to get a small consulting firm if possible. Anything too big and you'll get a lot of downtime (larger companies tend to have logistical issues getting work to the humble co-op students), making for a fairly poor co-op experience, though your pay will tend to be higher. I would not recommend a field job, these tend to be really repetitive and you don't learn much, and have unpredictable hours from working around contractor schedules (particularly geotech field testing). 

Imo you want to develop a lot of transferable skills in your first co-op, such as report writing, dealing with contractors, autocad/revit, construction drawing interpretation (structural if possible), specification editing. Then in your next few get more technical skills which will make you look far more attractive for your upper year co-ops. They typically won't hire anyone short of 4th year for structural jobs, but try to get jobs involving things like contract administration, project management, and if you can pick up some design work do it.

The big firms which would be comparable to google would be things like WSP, there are also a few big companies that employ from uw, such as ARUP, Walter P Moore, Hatch, PCL, to name a few, but I would not necessarily say big is better in terms of our industry for co-op. Not totally analogous to the software and programming kids."
"My thought on that is what my best friend's mom used to always say to us: ""making out leads to sex"".

Once you're kissing someone regularly it's really a matter of time until you have sex. So it's a huge gray area to figure out how quickly to progress and what level of commitment to require at what point.

I wish I had a good answer but I really don't. Obviously waiting until marriage to have sex is fool proof but it's also broken by basically everyone, even historically. The Italians have a term (I forget what it is) for the pregnancy that girls have from this sort of thing but it used to always end in marriages... so it's always been common to have sex before marriage it seems, *but* the understanding was that it would end in marriage most of the time because she would likely get pregnant in less than a year. 

""Virginity"" also used to mean something far less trivial. Because birth controls were not very reliable until the last 50 years or so, a virgin was more like a woman who had never had a child.. and so her body couldn't exactly lie about being a virgin.Maybe she played around a bit and got lucky not to get pregnant but with ""consent"" in the 2018 sense being pretty loosely defined, it was unlikely she'd take a sexual partner and not end up pregnant within a few months, and everyone in the village would find out anyway etc. 

Between birth control, porn, and tinder, I really have no clue how to navigate the dating scene in 2018... good luck, lol.

I wanted to know if any major market research has been done around the competition Bomber faces?

It’s not based on grades. You apply and then collect a bunch of signatures from students who would support you.

"hmm? The question had nothing about argv?

But yes, you can change argv as well. Obviously, you can only replace it with a string that's smaller or equal in length, but it's possible. argv[0], for example, is just a pointer to a location in memory (like everything in C) and you can just write to it (as long as you don't overwrite argv[1])"
"Seating is not the point here. I would say most people of the school no matter what race do this. And in this situation, if you consider this as a fault, they were both saving seats so this cancels out. (And funny, the guy was trying to save more seats calling on the girls.) It’s the following up, which this guy shouldn’t start the racial comments and threats. From what I’ve heard in class, the girls weren’t mean. They just sat down and said let the others that came later sit wherever is empty (before this conflict starts). Also there are lots of distorting facts on this internet. "

"I don't mind NYC, having been there previously

"As a starting point: with the exception of our two Council-Directors, Council isn't the Board; the Council helps hold the Board accountable (but currently really lacks teeth... hence the new bylaw reforms).

So the Board is primarily focused on maintaining and protecting the corporation from a legal, fiduciary, and risk capacity. I am sure /u/OHlookABoard can speak to this item, but the recommendation for rejection likely lies on the fact that keeping commercial operations budgets confidential _protects Feds businesses from their competition_ against say groups like UW Food Services, Pubs like Molly Blooms, and Bars like Phils. Also, these budgets tend to have personnel salaries.

Now there's a reasonable argument for greater oversight of the budgets and accountability of the finances of the corporation to the students. As you can see in the ""*Budget &amp; Appropriations Resolution*"", the **Board very much agrees that oversight of these budgets is important** and doesn't have anything to hide. 

All this being said, this argument for rejection is about only **one** clause in this resolution."

"Nope. Early acceptance means just that: you’re accepted early. Congrats, you have more time to consider the offer. All Ontario universities give you until the same day to accept or decline an offer regardless of when the offer comes in. That means you can wait until the deadline to see if any better offers come in, though you’ll know decisions by early May as that’s when the last round of offers usually goes out. 

I can’t speak to admission cycles for outside Ontario. You may have different deadlines for universities outside of Ontario which may require quicker responses or may respond to you later than the June 1st Ontario deadline. 

However, declining an undergrad offer at any Ontario university does not put you on any blacklist by the ministry or by the university itself.  You can also accept and later reverse the acceptance. The portal will only let you accept one at a time from what I know. You have nothing to gain from this strategy of accepting and declining. Remember, you have until the deadline to respond and an earlier response won’t be advantageous in any way. You don’t access any perks by responding early, your spot doesn’t get taken away by not responding early, and no spots at Waterloo have opened up after the June 1st deadline for CS in my experience so there is no wait list to keep your hopes up for. 

Not that this applies to you but declining a graduate school offer similarly also doesn’t put you on a black list. The only time that that declining looks bad in graduate school instances with funding involvement but you can cross that bridge when you get there. "
"&gt; Startup opportunities are night and day

startup failures are also night and day.  mostly night.  take 1 hour and peruse through the linkedin of any new grad living in SV, and all their friends.  If they work at one place for more than 6 months it's a miracle.  Ive seen people list 15 companies in 2 years.  What the fuck?  All those stock options must really add up when they vest that imaginary money requiring 3 years employment.

&gt; the sheer number of VC's actively looking for ""the next big thing"" there.  

The 2000's saw VCs spending obscene money on all kinds of dumb shit.  This impregnated your brain with the idea that VC money grows on trees in SV - indeed it did.  [Not anymore](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/venture-capital-funding-outside-silicon-valley-pennsylvania-colorado-florida-startups-vcs.html).  People realize you don't need to pay a post teenage code monkey 150k, most of which just pays his rent (he doesn't qualify for a mortgage) if the only thing he's doing is writing code.  He's not networking, he's not schoozing, in fact he's afraid of socializing and really prefers an IM client or skype for business than real meetings where someone might pour your coffee and say ""hello"".  In thise case, it is a stupid idea to collect people in SV, and VCs realize this nowadays.  To actually live in SV is stupid unless you're the CEO, marketer, or other job that involves interactions with (wealthy, influential, socially powerful) humans.  To that end, the new business model is that some high end management will setup in and around SV, because of the connections necessary to do so there, but the tech work is farmed out to bedroom communities just like KW.  Take a look at the Tannery building for example, it is full of nearly unknown companies making pretty technical shit that all gets used in companies of startups based in SV.  Paying an AI engineer $130k to live in Kitchener accomplishes: (1) Cheaper for the company (2) More in pocket money for the employee - and other benefits.  This is the new model, and it's obvious why.  You should find ways to leverage it.

Or be a digital nomad, they arguably have it best, and also get laid on their own schedule.  If software is really your thing, you don't really need a phyical place at all, so why hunt one, unless you actually like the living area? And there's very little to like about SV."

Usually math advisors won’t override you into a core course like this if you’re below 60. You can talk to an advisor but more than likely they’ll suggest retaking 138 to hit the 60% requirements. You might be able to take the science equivalent of 237 instead but confirm with your advisor if that’s feasible (depending on your major)

"A good thing to keep in mind is to try and avoid staying up extremely late the night before an exam and constantly pulling all nighters is usually not a good way to retain the information in your head in anyway. But what's done is done, the first thing you need to do now is go and talk to your prof ASAP like the other comments have already suggested you do. Sit down and have a good talk to them about what happened and what you can do in order to rectify this mistake. This might be through a deferred exam, or they might left you shift the weight onto the finals (The latter option is pretty rough, but I've known several that have managed to save their marks in that manner). In addition to this, make sure you try to score as many marks as you can on other labs, quizzes and assignments until the finals.  


Always remember, this isn't the end of the world. You might be stressed as hell right now, but with a bit of hardwork and time management you'll be in the next term just laughing about how dumb this whole thing was. Take this experiences as a lesson and do your best to adjust for the next time."
"I'll give an answer slightly different from what you're asking. I *was* the ""good Asian child"", and my older brother wasn't. This shows in a lot of things, really. But the thing you'll notice is that, really, both of us just went the way we wanted to anyway, and turned out ok. 

Let's start with schooling. I was always good at math as a kid, and my dad quickly channeled this into a lot of math books during elementary school, taking me far ahead. In middle school it became the Gauss, which in turn led to Pascal, Fermat, and of course, the Euclid - all of which I enjoyed tremendously. I did well in science as well, and by the time I was on my way to study engineering I guess you could call me the ""good Asian STEM student"". 

My brother on the other hand was never great at math. Honestly he was *fine*, and his early failures were more due to being uninterested (he was more of the rowdy, athletic type), but he was never particularly talented. My mom wasn't happy about this at first, and tried to push him into STEM, which of course failed. He also had some run-ins with teachers and principals in terms of behaviour. Now he studies European history, and is actually quite active academically, arranging history club-sorta things and starting a journal with some classmates - which he seems to carry the brunt of himself. 

Funny you mention piano lessons, I studiously practiced the piano and finished RCM grade 10 in 5.5 years. (No regrets about this - still happily play to this day.) My brother dropped violin lessons after about 3 years of disinterested practicing, and later picked up guitar more casually. 

I could go on with some more examples, but the general theme is already apparent: my brother and I had quite diverging personalities (and we fought a lot as kids), and we both ended up taking the very different paths you'd probably expect based on our very different personalities and interests. And in the end, both of us turned out fine. 

What does this mean for your regret? Well, I think it's okay to regret some things, but most of the things you did (or didn't) do in your childhood were the result of your personality, meshed with your parents' desires. I probably wouldn't have pursued advanced math, finished elementary piano, learned badminton, etc. just because my dad wanted me to. He created those opportunities because he saw the interest and the potential. My brother's also matured a lot since the teenage misadventures and is happy with where he is, even in a somewhat different path from the ""good Asian child"". If they'd pushed him into the same direction as me he'd likely be less successful than he is now, and certainly much less happy. 

If you regret not learning piano (musical instruments are *wonderful* to learn and many adults regret this in particular), just try learning now. Don't let the regret of what you did as a kid hold you back. There's a club-ish (UW piano society) that's welcoming to beginners; or try Youtube (I recommend Josh Wright), or even just reach out to any friends who play (I'd be down honestly but I'm on co-op). 

tl;dr I don't think most kids are ""good children"", by any culture's standards, and that's fine. If you didn't conform to your parents' expectations then but have some regrets now, try to accept the past for what it is, and pursue some of those interests now if you want. Don't regret taking your own path through life. "

Not necessarily. Failing a midterm doesn’t have to mean that much. Take it as a wake up call and figure out what you’re doing wrong so that you can turn it around for the final.

1. CS will be rough, I dont know that anyone really cares that much about volunteering hours, its more of a good thing to have, AIF itself is good if its strong, but grades are def more important.

"I think you're reading too much into what I said and my intentions, but I'll clarify.

Whats the difference between using suffering and miserable?  I didn't mean to be rude, I'm not sure how saying someone is miserable is rude. It's not like I based that on nothing either. I've read a lot of the OPs comments and posts, and I'm sure he'd agree that he's incredibly unhappy. I've been miserable too, there's no judgement here and it's not anymore of a label than stating that hes suffering.

&gt; It’s also rude to assume anyone that would be in a similar relationship was miserable to begin with.

I didn't make this assumption. I'm not saying everyone who gets into a horrible relationship was miserable when they got into the relationship. I was spefically talking about the OPs case and hypothetical. 

Edit: actually re-reading through my response I think I was also talking about myself. Like if I didn't have friends, I'd be miserable and alone, but I prefer that to being miserable and with someone that treats me like shit.

Also, just curious have you ever been in an abusive relationship like this?"
"According to Statistics Canada,

&gt;This stands in contrast to nearly all other fields of study, where women now represent the vast majority of graduates—especially health and social science programs. Why are women staying away from STEM programs?

&gt;However, women have made gains much more rapidly than men in recent years. In 1991, the proportion of men and women aged 25 to 34 with a university degree was about the same (at 16%); by 2011, the proportion had increased to 37% among women and 27% among men. As a result, 59% of all university graduates aged 25 to 34 in 2011 were female.

How disappointing... only 59%.

&gt;Specifically, women accounted for 59% of graduates who had a university degree in science and technology, but accounted for 23% of graduates aged 25 to 34 with a university degree in engineering, and 30% of those with a degree in mathematics and computer science.

Again, 59% as a number is too low.

&gt;And among women who choose to pursue a degree in STEM, most do so in biology or science programs, resulting in even fewer women in engineering, computer science and mathematics programs. These choices have consequences, as fields of study such as engineering and computer science lead, on average, to better outcomes in the labour market in terms of employment, job match and earnings.

Clearly, women are choosing the wrong majors in STEM because they should be caring more about money! Only when women outnumber men 4 to 1 will the situation finally be ""Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.""

The only first year difference is which lab for 111/121 and where you take economics (since it's intro econ it's essentially the same though). Technically you could delay 111 and 121 if you wanted if you weren't in DD.

Going forward, Math/Bus single degree is 40 courses over 8 academic terms and 6 co-op terms. That means an average of 5 courses per term. DD is 52 courses over 10 academic terms and up to 5 co-op terms. That means you still only taking 5 courses each term, with 2 exceptions (either courses during a co-op term or taking 6 courses twice).

So really, you aren't going to (from a workload perspective) have all that much less work in the single degree program. People have this misconception that DD is some insanely difficult program compared to other programs - it isn't. It's incrementally more difficult because it's longer and all the courses are core courses so you can't take 'fun' electives.

In terms of course differences, DD gives you more flexibility on the math courses, and you take more business courses. Single degree has less choice on what math courses you take, and limited choice on the business courses - you just take less business courses overall. Also, you end up taking some of the business courses at UW instead of at Laurier.

I think before you make a decision to switch programs you need to think about why you feel the workload is ""killing you"" because switching programs won't necessarily have that much impact on it."

"Regardless of major, the hons math degree still demands math ""electives"" outside of the ones specifically outlined for our majors.

A stats or cs major at UofT, for instance, would be able to take non-math bird courses in place of the more demanding requirements we might have. So calling it a math degree from a math faculty is warranted, imo."
"Tbh I don't know much about how good their respective physics faculties are, but I've heard some good things about the (well funded, thx to Mike Lazaridis) Perimeter Institute for Physics in waterloo (associated with but independent from UW). Stephen Hawking even visited twice so I wouldn't be surprised if UW has an edge over UofT in physics."
"I'm in the same boat. Honestly I've tried all the tricks: drinking water in the morning, hiding my alarm, using an alarm that uses pictures. I can effectively just go back to sleep and ignore the alarms. For something like this it is better to focus on long term fixes as opposed to short term. I find it's good to lay out what I really want from the program, and why I'm doing it. Telling yourself to ""just go"" might work for a week, but then you'll end up back where you started. Having a therapist really helps to orient your goals and to talk to someone about why you don't want to go. Good luck!"

"&gt;And if we are being honest, yes that's behavior that is more prevalent among international students from China.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry but I don't agree that these are behaviors that are more prevalent among Chinese international students.

Saving seats for friends? Literally everyone I've met in uni does this, especially in first year. I've done this, my girlfriend does this and no one has ever said anything. If you have friends who are in the same lecture as you,  you'd wanna sit together with them and saving seats is very common.

&amp;#x200B;

Smoking in front of buildings? I've seen people of all different backgrounds and ethnicities being discourteous and smoking in front of entrances to buildings. I've seen local Canadians do this, I've seen European international students do this, I've seen Indian international students do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Talking and laughing in class? Come on, everyone has done this in uni, especially in more populated lectures.

&amp;#x200B;

Not blending with locals? Oh come on, we're gonna get mad at the Chinese for hanging out with other Chinese students now?"
"Alright that's fine. I'm clearly trying to help you and understand what your going through. I never said exercise is a cure, but exercise does relieve stress. Saying there's zero benefit to exercise is false.There's a reason why I'm asking you why you feel like just giving up is validated because no one will like you.The reason for your feeling that exercise does not help your mental health is directly related to why you think you should give up because no one will like you. And you need to address and ask why you feel that way.

Why do you believe giving up is validated because of other peoples opinions on you?

Why do you feel like you should only accomplish things to better yourself only if other people validate you?

Why do you feel like other peoples opinion should affect your physical or mental health?

Do you think other peoples opinions or whether they like you or not should affect your feelings? And if so, why?

Have you ever thought of joining fitness classes where you interact with other people?  
Human beings are innately social, and interacting with other human beings is important. "
"I get that your manager has had good experience with the co-op he had before, but it's also his responsibility to look at you as who you are, not Andy. That's a big fail on his part to constantly compare Andy to you, because you're not him and if he really wants you to perform at his level then he should be doing his part to guide you and mentor you to be like Andy. Sucks that you're not doing as good as Andy, but doesn't mean you should be compared to him on a daily basis since he's a goner and your manager should be able to work with what he has right now, not the remnants of what the good old days should be. Shitty management at best.

Here's the challenge: if your manager is a stuck up, old-school dumb manager who's not willing to listen to his subordinates and is a tyrant in getting the things done the way HE wants it done, don't bother telling him anything here, and just suck it up and try to be like Andy. You can tell him about your frustration and how you want to be better, but that might not get you anything more than ""sigh, fine, more disappointment for myself because you're not Andy."""
"Cultural differences are exhausting to handle over the long-term and this goes both ways: for the Canadian born and the recent immigrants.

Speaking for myself, I get irritated all the time by what Canadian born people do. For example, where I come from it's rude to start eating if everyone hasn't gotten their food yet (at a restaurant for example). Or when someones offers to pay at a restaurant, you should let them and insist to pay next time.

I just suck it up, it's fine. First of all, I'm a guest in this country and second, I remind myself that there is no intended malice. That requires a conscious effort because cultural customs are deeply ingrained and a social interaction where the opposite part contravene to one of these deeply ingrained beliefs is immediately interpreted as adversarial by our monkey brains.

&gt;Can we all try to be a little nicer to one another and if you see an Asian international student doing something that you personally find critical by your perfect set of moral guidelines and lifestyle

I don't think it's a matter of anyone believing their cultural practices are superior or perfect. People expect new comers to actively try to fit in their host society. Rightfully so in my opinion.

I have found most Canadians (regardless of """"""""race"""""""") to be nice and well inclined towards immigrants. In my opinion the animosity is not racially motivated rather it stems from the perception that there is an influx of newcomers that is not making an effort to fit in.

When you stop believing that a certain behavior is a cultural misstep that can be corrected people get aggressive.

I agree with this, and I don't agree with people who commit or promote violence against LGBT people, but loving includes saying something when you think your neighbor is on a destructive path. Being respectful doesn't mean playing along.

"I worked in Communitech last terms in one of the innovation labs, very much in TD Labs' proximity.

Hi everyone I'm looking for people (cute boys only, please) who I can drink alcohol with, namely Pabst Blue Ribbon. On average I can put away around 10 to 14 drinks in one session, so ideally I'd like to meet someone who can have 10 or more beers with me. I am willing to purchase alcohol and also provide manual stimulation if needed.

"You still have second round and continuous. It is very common for students to not get interviews or jobs until continuous. I got all three of my past co-op placements in continuous and hell was it stressful. Worst case scenario though, your co-op term has to be a minimum of 12 weeks which means you do still have quite a bit of time to job hunt.

For actionable items I would get your resume looked over, either by posting it on the [Waterloo Resume Critique Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9gkcr1/resume_critique_megathread/), going to CECA, going to the UW Writing Centre, or having a friend look it over. You might be selling yourself short or not appropriately tailoring it to the job. If you are still worried start looking for jobs on your own. Reach out to companies and inquire about potential co-op positions. Best of luck!"
"It doesn't disagree with me, I don't think your reading comprehension is quite up to snuff.

The strong and muscular type is the most attractive, but if you're fat then being strong as well can mitigate the negative effect of being fat. That's what the article says. It does not say being strong and fat is best, it says strong and fat is better than fat. This is not an assertion you ever made.

The fact that 160 women unanimously agreed that (what they perceived to be) strong body types were the most attractive is, in my opinion, sufficient support for my assertion that the strong and muscular body type is the most attractive for men.

My interpretation of your first comment was that it was sarcastic, asking ""how can that be true if strongmen aren't viewed as most attractive"". My response was that though strongmen are stronger than bodybuilders, the typical person wouldn't think that purely by looking at them.

You strawmanned my argument by claiming I thought a strongman would instantly become attractive once you know that there are actually extremely strong. This is not something I ever claimed."

"Did they provide a reason as to why they're not responding/are busy?

If no, and assuming your flair is correct - CC the math assoicate dean, co-op (math.coop.ad@uwaterloo.ca) in the email. 

If it's the associate dean, co-op you're contacting, then I'd say wait a couple days. If they hit you with an academic penalty, you might have grounds to file a grievance (though I don't know your exact case). 

You also might want to reach out to Feds CAPS - academic@feds.ca, the Feds co-op affairs commissioner (coop.affairs@feds.ca), Feds VPED (vped@feds.ca), or the MathSoc VPA (vpa@mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca)."
"Make your own problems. Make problems with friends and give them to eachother. Try to find creative ways to combine the concepts you know.

Your GPA doesn't really mean shit. No one cares other than you lol. If you want to get jobs, your projects and out of school experience mean more. Having a high average would make it more likely for your resume to be looked at, but whether they interview you will be based on the content of your resume.

First year classes aren't even included in major average half the time and most grad schools only look at 3-4th year courses if that's what you're going for."
"Many of the males at the University of Waterloo are of the highest caliber, likely due to the in depth character analysis through the AIF.

"There are various benefits to exercise. You can start doing things you could never do before. For example, carrying a lot of groceries home, carrying your significant other, dragging a mattress up a bunk bed, and bouldering are all things I couldn't do just a year ago, but can do now. It feels good to be able to move my body and accomplish things and to not have it feel fat and sluggish.

As for appearances, if you don't look much different, you aren't doing the right exercises, not eating correctly, wanting results too quickly and giving up when you don't get them, or some combination of the 3."
"I like your response.  It's well crafted, it's informative and didactic, it commands authenticity that even I believe can only be borne of true experience; an expert in the field.  You in part did this by so carefully avoiding reciprocation of my salty tone that it must have been on purpose - a hallmark of professional HR that is also delivering good and careful value to your employer (ie. no lawsuits please).  Your diplomacy and tact is also impressive.  I've seen you handle similar, more abrasive inquiries than mine in the same strategic and effective way.  That is to say, I remember you.

One, rather subtle, but important observation for people who carefully choose words or need to convey in sincerity to their audience or win trust in a vulnerable and open client, is be careful around your use of ""i statements"".  You kind of used them interchangeably, which makes me think you aren't really paying attention to it.  Which is understandable, most people don't.  But at your advanced stage of professional communication it might be something to keep in the back of your mind, for example, you started with strong ""I statements"" like:

&gt; I think that....

&gt; I assume devs won't ....

you got even better when you ommitted yourself as the subject altogether, and just stated plainly:

&gt; Cashiers won't remember...

I really like that, it's incredible progression from ""i statement"" (ie. please consider my opinion) to ""my statements are plainly true, you should accept them without consideration."" Neatly formed, developed with careful pace and cadence.  This is how you won me, and you did it within 6 sentences.

But then some kind of lesser confidence showed up, you switched to ""you statements"":

&gt; You try to make every interaction count...

Maybe ""you"" don't actually, really, make every interaction count...I know I don't, I'd like to, but, reality is, I don't...  Anyway:

&gt; even after you forget someone

Who's forgetting whom here?  This is vague language and I get why you use it, it's colloquial, but it has the real effect of dampening your authority on the topic, or worse conveys (unconsciously) some uncertainty or insecurity.  

&gt; you'll put in effort to try to...

&gt; you really build relationships with....

&gt; You remember every big moment...

&gt; you fight for these people to help them....

and then back to ""i statements"", which makes me think you're returning to full sincerity again, and that the middle part may have been a bit of personal puffing or idealism:

&gt; I don't remember every...

&gt; it doesn't stop me from....

&gt; I promised myself...

Maybe this little blurb sounds like semantics, but, consider it for what it's worth.

Anyway that being said, you seem like a remarkably driven and exceptionally skilled HR person, which i'm sure you know is very rare (the skilled part especially), so I have some more, authentic questions for you:

1.  Given the difficulties most managers (and companies generally) have relating to their staff (and vice versa), and given that you have an unusual ability to bridge the candidate/employee with the organization, do you think it's more important to establish strong working teams with deep pocketed companies who have the ability to pay you a higher contract fee, or is it more important/rewarding to engage a candidate/employee with an organization where s/he will be able to not only meet their own personal human goals (wrt. both finances or purpose of life) but also goals that advance society as a whole, regardless of the personal financial benefits you may reap yourself in the process?  ie. You are awesome at your job but you have a limited number of people you can help so wouldn't you prefer to help people get connected with work that is better for society than simply work that earns company-you-candidate the most money? ttl;ddr Aren't there more gooder ways you could use your powerful and rare skill?

2.  Lighter: How do you feel about companies who or the practice of  'rebranding' HR to something like ""culture ambassadors"" or ""people and practices"" or ""team member relations"" instead of just saying what everyone knows it is: HR.  Do you think employees buy into these name changes, how do you think bright employees feel about this sort of thing (for example I think it's patronizing).

3.  LIGHTER LIGHTER:  What's your favourite Dilbert comic relating to HR?

"&gt; But you don't think it's kinda weird that it's literally only East Asians that do this? 

That's an interesting observation that I hadn't thought of before actually. I want to try to find some examples to prove otherwise but its true that a lot of East Asians do this. If I had to guess I would theorize that it's because east Asian names are among the hardest names for English speakers to pronounce, so we often come up with another name just to avoid that half second hesitation whenever someone is about to read our name aloud.

"&gt; Just because it's the norm, doesn't mean it's right.

Did I say or imply that it was right?

I implied, and later explicitly stated, that you are deluded if you think you're getting your deposit back from these companies.

This has nothing to do with whether what they're doing is right or not. It also has nothing to do with whether you should take action against it or not. My point is that if you are surprised when they don't return your deposit (or make it impossibly hard), then you are deluded. You should go in expecting to not get your deposit back if you are renting with these companies."

"Apply Apply Apply. 50 is not enough. You can say you definitely tried once you hit 200. 

Apply anywhere to get your foot in the door. A lot of people here working at Cali for their 5th/6th Co-ops started off as a QA analyst paid barely above minimum at some startup for their very first Co-op. Don't just apply to dev jobs or good jobs. You need experience first. 

I applied to about 100 jobs before I found my first Co-op. I applied literally everywhere, from research to   communications to marketing. I ended up working for the University for my first Co-op as a RA. During that time, I worked to build experience by asking to do relevant work and beefed up my resume. Come second Co-op,  I was competitive for some policy positions.

Now I'm working for the Federal Government as a Policy Analyst. I didn't start off there, and getting there took work. "

Any tips would probably be actually study haha. Some less obvious stuff maybe would be to take an LSAT prep course. I know Laurier offers one, idk if Waterloo does. Also bring a watch. They let you have watches and everybody had them when I went.

"I like to read the textbook (like the entire chapter were on) before the course gets to it. This way I can go to class for clarification rather than for learning, and if i miss a class (which happens often) im alright.

Many people find lectures too fast or too slow. Studying before the lectures will help if you are struggling to keep up.

 If the class is memorization based then rewriting notes will help a little. But in every case I find that a better way of studying for things like that is to take notes and convert them into discussions and flashcards. If the class is not memorization based, you should be doing practice problems instead of worrying about clean notes.

Your break is for stopping burnout. If you want top marks for grad school or something i can see the benefit of reading ahead in courses. Or if you just find it fun to learn ahead."
"The reason I want to see grades first is because I have a very limited window of time to review 100 applications and maybe pull out 20 for further review. I will weigh experience heavily but if your marks are poor that is definitely concerning (sub 65). You are still considered but now I'm only looking at top line experience info to see if it's a company and role that makes you uniquely qualified for the role.

If you have amazing grades 90+ in relevent courses I will review your experience in detail because clearly you were doing something right and our ideal candidate has amazing grades and experience so I don't want to miss that candidate. But if you had poor marks but it wasn't immediately clear your experience is relevent then very likely you would have ultimately been cut due to someone else having similar experience but better grades anyway."
"You are a good example of someone I wish I met while I was on the ground at UW.  Everything you've said has been positive and informed, I wish I could say the same about myself.

"I think you being pedantic about a toilet cubicle not extrapolating to the poorly ventilated public bathrooms seen in most populated areas is about as foolish as believing that the original hygienic practices laid out for public bathrooms is flawless simply because it's 2018.

If billions of people do something foolish for a century, does that make it not foolish?

Before you clap back, which I have no doubt you're capable of (and I genuinely mean that) I will concede that if I were to accidentally get doodoo or felt sweaty around my crotch and felt like I dirtied my hands (or felt sick), I would actually wash them simply because I don't want to spread my contaminants just as much as I don't want others spread to me. However, my ultimate point is that public bathrooms were never built for dumb people who don't care about others. They were built for people who generally care about hygiene. The problem is that the majority of humans are dumb or unaware of hygiene (possibly because they were never taught, or possibly because their immune system is strong enough for them to not have to care). Under these conditions, the assumptions originally set out for bathrooms to work break down, and people like me choose to adapt by not touching anything with our hands except the door knob (and if possible not even that by grabbing a piece of paper towel to do that)"
"&gt; There are MD doctors who are anti-vaxxers so in that sense of your argument you are 100% wrong.

&gt; Regardless, I acknowledged not every argument is as obvious as antivaxxing and nazis which you didnt acknowledge at all.

Alright, but my point isn't that every argument I don't agree with should be banned, I don't think we should give nazis a platform to debate on. 

&gt; When it comes to defining nazis, liberals are notoriously bad these days, for one so yeah just let people speak.

They can speak, I don't think people are obligated to speak to ol mr ""the 14 words are harmless"" a platform to debate on. I do agree that some people are bit fast on ""X is a nazi"", and I don't think just calling someone a nazi means they shouldn't have a platform to speak on, but if someone's going to argue that black people are inferior, I don't think that deserves a public debate.

&gt; I like how you arent even pretending you are anti free speech

I'm not even pretending I am? I'll give you my stance.

I'll tell you this - if someone I have over is going to talk about removing all minorities, I'll show them the door. If a doctor wanted to fire their secretary for telling patients that vaccines cause autism, I think that's fine. If a university doesn't allow people to argue about killing jews, that's fine. If youtube doesn't want to host Alex Jones, so be it (which reminds me, you'd think I'd be shocked that no one hosting his crap hasn't suddenly spiked his popularity from people on the fence. Shocked, I tell you!).

If the government wants to arrest someone for saying that they think there's only two genders, I don't agree with that. If the government shoots anyone arguing that everyone wants to eat cheese (or whatever), I don't agree with that. 

If that makes me anti-free speech, I'll live with it. "
"Building a top tier business school at UW would cost a LOT of money and likely wouldn't bring the school any significant benefits until well into the future.

Your impression about Laurier and business is a little bit skewed. Laurier for undergraduate business would be in the top 5-10 in Canada depending on who you ask. The only places that you would see consistently above Laurier would be Queens, Ivey, UofT, York, McGill, and UBC. And really, Rotman and York aren't really that much (if at all) better than Laurier for undergrad business. Laurier could also make a few small changes and produce a much stronger undergrad program reputation (of course they might not make those decisions). 

That said, business school's aren't completely designed around undergrads. That's why you see a lot of the top US B-schools don't even having undergrad programs. MBA program attractiveness and therefore ability to attract students are influenced heavily by job placements and perceived prestige. UW would need to put in a lot of work to build relationships for MBA level internships with top companies who aren't necessarily in UW's traditional suite of corporate partners/recruiters. 

There would also be a significant challenge in building up a sizable faculty for business, especially if you want them to be anything close to research active. Outside of accounting and finance (which are already hard enough to find good research active faculty for), I don't think UW has a significant number of faculty that could move to a business school already on staff (granted I haven't gone through every department's faculty listing, so if someone else knows, please correct me). I know someone else mentioned economics, but that actually isn't a traditional business discipline, and in a number of places economics is separate from business economics (similarly entrepreneurship is a nice bonus, but isn't the same as what you would need in a traditional BBA/BCom/MBA program).

This is in addition to needed to develop a new curriculum for business programs and if using current profs could need to train them on teaching with case methods etc. I briefly went through the course listings and UW probably has enough courses in HR and obviously accounting and finance for a full business school curriculum. Outside of that UW would need to develop a bunch of courses (or rework current offerings) for a traditional BBA program. More work would be needed for an MBA program if they want to compete with top level MBA programs. 

Those are just a handful of the challenges, and that doesn't touch the physical space and infrastructure requirements that UW would need to bring in a new undergrad program and faculty space.

I'm not saying UW couldn't develop a strong business school, but it isn't all that easy, and the return on investment is likely lower than putting more money into math, physics, engineering, etc."

"Python is really only good for low-mid level problems. There are more hard problems where python struggles than you might think, due to python's worse constant factor (e.g. lists). Though python might be given a higher time limit, from the experience of a contest setter, we might not test python as rigorously compared to C++ for hard problems, since python submissions are rare. As a result, python time limits may be estimates.

"Coming from an arts student to an arts student.

I love arts and find the classes more interesting than any of the science classes I take. I actually get better marks in them *because* they are interesting as fuck.

It's just easy to take the piss out of them because in the end of the day, a degree in liberal arts won't get you the same paying job as someone who slaved away at engineering or medical science.

I'm not saying its worthless by any means. 

In an engineering class you will learn the tensile strength of steel. But in an Liberal arts degree you'll learn how to think and the history of how to think and all that fun jazz. Thats not a worthless skill at all and is very, very important. Its just not a skill that'll make you money or allow you too stand out. Thats where we get pissed on. Is it fair? no. is it right? no. in the end does it matter? fuck no. do what you want and don't let it get to you that people make fun of what you love. Thats what we are learning in arts after all.

Its easy to piss on us because we make it so easy. Do you really think pure mathematics is so different from us?"

This means Feds will advocate the University of Waterloo Senate to implement a full-week Fall Break pilot, and Feds President Richard Wu will cast his Senate vote in favour of a full-week Fall Break pilot.

Should the Senate vote in favour of a full-week Fall Break pilot, it would be implemented in 2019. 

As Feds oversees and plans Orientation, the organization will not be changing or advocating change to the lenth of Orietation as students definitively stated they wished for no changes to be made to the current Orientation programming format (*ie*, the status quo of 3-days will be kept).

"Hey OP! First, I'm sorry for your loss. It's up to you whether or not your act on any of the advice anyone here will offer, but please don't blame yourself for things like missing lectures or breaking down. You're grieving right now, and while it's different for everyone, the stuff you're talking about is perfectly normal. It sucks and it's a long process, but you can and will get through it.

You can't, however, get this term back if you choose to push through it. You probably won't learn as well as you would normally - what with being distracted and all - so there is a real risk that you end up worse off if you try to push through it. Don't be afraid to drop down a year to take care of yourself. It's not weakness to need time.

I've read through the other threads here, and more than anything, I really think you should get counselling immediately. UW catches crap all the time about student wellness failures, but they will make time for you ASAP if you indicate that you need it. If you're in ENG, you can use the ENG counselling resources, which might move faster. Your call.

You've already been talking to your academic counsellor, so keep doing that. It's really important that they know what you're dealing with, so that they can advocate for you, just like your counsellor.

After that, I too would suggest either doing a reduced course load or withdrawing altogether and coming back next term or year. I understand the fear/uncertainty around losing your group of friends, but I think you might be overemphasizing this in your decision making. I actually dropped back a year due to illness myself, and while there are some people that I miss having around, there are also going to be a lot of good people in whatever class you end up joining.

More importantly, though, I can't overstate how much better prepared I was for school when I came back and how much worse off I might have been had I pushed through it. Some of the courses that have followed build on material in the term I postponed; if I had pushed through with the term, I might have passed, but the following couple of terms would have been a disaster.

It also didn't impact my OSAP situation, just as survivor's benefits wouldn't make your situation worse, just different. That is to say, any trade-off between survivor's benefits and OSAP should be a wash - any change in your financial situation should actually be to the better, not the worse. Most of what I'm saying here is a repeat of what others have said, but I thought clearing up confusion around OSAP might be helpful. Don't worry about the money, take care of yourself first.

I hope this helps. Be well."

"340nm to 770nm

&amp;#x200B;

According to Vassili Karanassios the only correct answer is 400nm to 800nm because the question says approximately even though 3 of the 4 answers seem to be approximate. Keep in mind that this was never discussed anywhere in the textbook, lecture notes, tutorial or lecture itself, I just guessed. I thought this was analytical chemistry not the fucking riddle hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: also 340nm to 770nm is a greater range  than 400 nm- 800nm so if he wants to be a smartass with the wording,  340nm to 770nm is more approximate than 400-800 because it has less precision."
"Basically Nuland describes what happens in a variety of common reasons for death: accident, cancer, etc. The purpose is to explore the events which lead up to death, how to live and die with dignity, and how to deal with terminal illnesses.

He writes the book in his final years and reflects on his life as a surgeon, the transformation into his own illness, and how he lived with cancer and the choices he made. "
"Here's the problem as I see it. A true sit down restaurant/bar will never be profitable on campus. It doesn't match the market demand of students, and its range is to small. Theres 100 better places to go that are within 10 minute travel time, with free parking available/or close to public transit. Thus, the Bomber has virtually no advantage over comparable establishments.  I would cut my losses and lease the space or totally revamp it to serve only fast food. Its best advantage is that its on campus, with thousands of students. It should meet this market demand and not try to be something it isn't."
"the best advice i can give you then is to not be discouraged :) school is also a stressful time that can make it hard to focus on deepening relationships so don't stress yourself out too much. maybe if you really feel that you want to move faster with someone take initiative and tell them, push yourself to build deeper bonds with people and see what happens. Being vulnerable can be difficult but sometimes it helps to deepen relationships.

"Depends on the kind of relationship. My view applies for both friendships and romantic relationships.

If it's someone I'm looking to relate to on an emotional level it matters more because I like being in physical proximity with them at least once in awhile. Like seeing each other once every couple of weeks is fine so like coop in toronto + school in wtl is no biggie but I wouldn't start a relationship like this with someone I know really wants to go to cali next year or something because it'd really hurt when it starts to fade."
"I fully agree that girls still need to take responsibility for the fact that they didn’t communicate their expectations, but saying having sex is just like helping someone with homework is very wrong. It completely ignores the fact that you can change someone’s life by having sex with them. It neglects the chemicals in the brain that are associated with the act. You really can not compare having sex with doing a favour or a task. That’s the real issue here with the argument.

Like I said, I agree girls need to take responsibility for what their expectations are, but the analogy does not work because it compares sex, something that is scientifically proven to have a very different effect than other tasks, with things that don’t have the same types of effects. 

As well, guys don’t complain because they’re the ones who get what they wanted in those situations. Just like girls have a responsibility to voice what they expect, guys have a responsibility to do the same. It’s called being responsible with your sexual activity. Have fun safe sex all you want, but safe sex entails communication. "

"personally, i think this is because asians are portrayed to be more reserved, unthreatening, weak, docile and conflict-avoiding compared to the other races. this is probably due to our culture where we have to act respectfully and politely to everyone.

hence, non-asians tend to act more aggressively towards asians to take advantage of their nature. "
"I would put tutoring at the bottom and have your financial position first. This is more relevant to the jobs you're applying to.

You may also want to rearrange the order of your skills and focus on your analysis ones first. 

Your bullet points are not strong enough you need to focus on what and how you did things. Also put the most impressive things you do first for each section.

Although it's advised against to put your education at the top since you're coursework is most relevant to the jobs you're applying for I would consider putting it at the top. Then sales director, then your other two jobs."
"Well OSAP needs you to pass 6 courses in the fall and winter term in order for you to not be on probation. You will still get money for the winter term, and you will be placed on probation (if you've never been on probation) when you apply for OSAP next year. 

You can either just keep it on your record and keep it moving, just know you have to meet the requirements or risk the 1 year restriction. Or you can appeal the probation and provide your medical documentation, and if they approve it then your record is clear and you won't be placed on restriction if you failed to meet OSAP requirements again.

"honestly, your view seems to be from a traditional standpoint... and traditionally mathematics did not include statistics or computer science. This is because the these two branches are very young relative to the rest of mathematics.... 100 years ago statistics/cs hardly existed/did not exist at all.

The ""father"" of modern statistics was born in 1890 (Ronald Fisher)... so that already tells you statistics has not truly been around. Computers are even newer. Over the past century, these two branches grew exponentially (not surprising seeing as how computers have changed our lives so drastically).

"where did you get the questions to practice problems? I'm not sure if it was different when you took 1st year math classes but we just have the course notes with like a couple examples with solutions and that's it, and some of the exams don't have solutions so I have no idea if I'm doing it right. 

And when/how do you know that you've nailed proofs? This is the hardest part of this program for me, I have a hard time deciding at the start of a question what method I will use to prove a statement. So I don't know if at the end I actually used a valid method or if I wrongly forced the statement to work."
"Exactly. If your just going to gym and doing random workouts, that is an incorrect way of approaching it, especially if your feeling what the OP is feeling. 

Make sure you record the workouts you do and how many reps and sets you accomplish and the weight you lifted. Record those things down. And then week to week slowly increase the reps or weight. And make small goals whether it be number of reps or whether it be the weight you hope to lift. Increase the weight bit by bit every week or two. And accomplish those goals. 

This is the correct way of approaching exercise and fitness. This will show you how your accomplishing your goals.

The incorrect way of approaching exercise is just randomly doing workouts and not taking note of what your doing, and not setting goals.

Remember, set small goals and accomplish them.
Rome wasn’t built in a day. Slow and steady wins the race. You cannot transform your health over night. This is why i stress setting small goals.

"I'm in Laurier CS. In first year I applied to over 150 positions all over the country. I made a spreadsheet to keep track of all my applications. I applied from November all the way to mid April.

I went on this subreddit's resume critiquing megathread to have a reference as to what my resume should look like. I only highlighted what is needed and did not bullshit anything. If you have a volunteer experience section, remove it and put the relevant contents under a ""relevant experience"" section.

Most employers at job fairs are looking for new grads, so odds are that my resume would go in the trash. What I did was go up to the HR managers and ask them to critique my resume. This forces them to read over it and give you good feedback. Sometimes employers who really like my resume would take it and email me back, even letting me connect with them on LinkedIn.

Speaking of LinkedIn, make an account and make your profile look good ASAP. Not being on LinkedIn makes you look unprofessional.

I don't know if UofT has its own version of WaterlooWorks/Navigator but use it to apply for jobs. Some employers post their internships under the general postings page alongside co-op postings.

Lastly, network with people. Most jobs are actually acquired by putting your name out there. It's like making a business pitch - gain people's trust before making the pitch. If you applied for a local company who is showing up to that job fair, make sure you mention that you already applied online and wanted to drop off your resume in person. I got invited to an interview a couple days after a job fair at a big company by doing this."

"I respectfully disagree. A ""cultural mosaic"" is just an euphemism for multiple cultures and societies coexisting in parallel.

"Overall I really enjoyed Math 135 - it teaches you the foundations of mathematical proofs. However, a lot of it is new. Generally, when I study, I go over the notes, then redo most of the assignment/tutorial problems and look over past exams if I can find them. Practice makes perfect! (To be fair, I leave most of it to the last minute since I'm lazy)

Just a side note, although some of the assignment questions are tricky, I didn't find the assignments to be too bad. If you tend to take over a day per assignment, I would recommend trying to find a study group to work with, it'll make your life easier.

"
"Yes, but only with my guy friends who are really depressed lolll.

Edit: oh and one time I went on a camping trip with my best friends where we canoed out into the middle of nowhere and camped. We ended up having endless debates about the strangest topics just for the sake of it. E.g. We talked about whether being speciesist is a real thing, and whether it's a bad thing for 5 hours straight around a campfire one day. And we talked about whether morality stems from empathy or the other way around (or neither). But if by deep conversations you mean emotional, then refer to the first part of the comment. "

You can't really throw out a blanket statement like that with no evidence. While studies on the effects of weed are limited, most experts would not agree with your statement. 

Edit: That's not to say there aren't bad side effects - which depend highly on the frequency of use - but being ignorant and throwing around the statement that weed ""fries your brain"" is ridiculous and outdated. If you've ever had a beer, you're a hypocrite. "

"&gt; Ok I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you don't know calling all white people who don't want Canada to be 20% white by 2100 Nazis is literally coded speech for globalists who are chasing corporate monopolies and societal chaos to inflict even more control and surveillance on us.

Oh wow, so going full on conspiracy then eh?

&gt;They are simply advocating for a space where white people can have their culture and stop bending over backwards to serve immigrants' needs like Liberals do in Toronto and Vancouver.

Haha. The irony is grand.  So if we protect ""white culture"" we had best get rid of Oktoberfest, since that is German and not part of the founding Anglo-Francophone culture of Canada. 

&gt;Do the Japanese ""hate"" all non-Japanese? No.

Picking one of the most xenophobic countries isn't the best example to go with. They are also very Americanized since WWII.

Everyone is!  The country is so young we are all relatively immigrants. Though nice attempt at insulting people for simply moving to a new country.

&gt;  
&gt;***Progress to Date:*** Contacted the MME and ECE head, both of them and the MME’s chief financial person didn’t know if they received it. Asked at CWG, none of the department representatives knew if they received it. Also got feedback that this has been asked about for years, and that EngSoc should be looking at if $14 is justified as different departments use TAs, professors, faculty members for marking. At CEC, found out that the CEE co-op fee deep dive is now including an investigation regarding the work term report fee, and that they’ll keep me updated.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Plan:*** Follow up with CEE and make sure the “where $14” as well as “why $14” is justified.

Re: make voting easier -- having super polls on campus, which are open from 10 am to 8 pm on Monday, and signing a legal declaration of eligibility to register to vote on the spot is pretty easy. 

Re: internet voting -- There are significant security concerns with internet voting, and for me the concerns significantly outweigh the benefits.

"Absolutely agreed. I really think the biggest contributor to my depression is lack of social inclusion, in particular people I thought were friends actively excluding me.

I'd love to test that hypothesis but the only way to do that would be to get socially included more and see how that affects my mental health.

Not gonna happen any time soon, i know."
Bad exams happen. (I am awful at MC exams!) My advice is to study from this quiz. Go through all questions that you got wrong and try to get some insight of how you could change your studying approach to get those questions correctly. I would also discuss your quiz with the instructor to see if they can recommend new studying techniques for this course.
"Best way to get less awkward is to always try to leave your comfort zone! Always try to say yes to any activity you're invited to and maybe join a rec sports league (or something like that). Over time you'll find conversations get easier and easier...

"I mean they go through a lot of stress, but that's primarily because UofT lets everyone that can walk and talk into their programs for the first year fees, and weed them out.

"I think it's more useful to do leetcode with other people for the purpose you said. I don't think there's a set time since it depends on your familiarity, cognitive abilities and even what problem you start with.

"In that case I might see if your faculty has someone you can contact about it, although I'm relatively certain they use the same company.

"Thinking beyond the course material and thinking about what it actual means without caring about what will be on the test, studying efficiently, the effective time you study, going above and beyond on things that academically don't matter like work reports, etc.

"Politics doesn't operate in a vacuum. Everyone is free to support whomever they so choose. But in reality, there are individuals/candidates who have no chance, while others are backed by special interests. By voting for the little guy, you add one more tally to their corner, but what does it truly mean? Nothing. It just gives people an illusion of choice. It offers hope and perpetuates an unfair system manipulated by capital interests. So, is it worth playing ignorant and voting for the candidate with no shot? I think not, if all it does is placate ourselves with a taste of something that doesn't exist. "

"idk if you heard but the midterm average last year was a 30%, so if you're failing you aren't alone. our prof also mentioned that she can only fail 5% of the class, so you just gotta be above that 5% if you want to make it :)

redo the quizzes, do the assignments, and honestly just email your prof if you have any questions. the best way to approach physics problems as a whole (imo) is to take everything one step at a time - the questions can look very intimidating, but if you take it apart piece by piece it'll start to make a bit more sense (at least that's how it was for me, and i failed the first quiz)"
"The big tech companies are probably going to rule the world within a few decades. They can already largely control what we see, what we know, and what viewpoint it's all from although at the moment it's too risky for them or Western governments to widely use this technology. It's just going to get worse as these mega corporations become solidified, stale, and increasingly paranoid about maintaining their status. They're already helping governments like China have massive power over what their populace has access to. Universities have basically become breeding grounds to turn the smartest people in our society into useful ideological underlings to consolidate the power of the establishment over us all. If everyone had families and close-knit communities to take up their free time, the establishment would have far fewer rootless reactionaries to manipulate."

"&gt; The strong and muscular type is the most attractive, but if you're fat then being strong as well can mitigate the negative effect of being fat. 

It says the strongest predictor of attractiveness was strength. I assert therefore, it'd predict that Eddie Hall is more attractive than Plitt because of his strength. 

The article didn't say strongest looking, it said strongest. The study in question brings up examples like handgrip strength, which isn't exactly easy to tell by physique. 

Finally, reading the article, I found one importantly missing piece of information - what wasn't included was the upper limits on how strong and muscular looking the people were. [In the example set](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/284/1869/20171819/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1) of photos, it seems like they chose ""fit or unfit"", as opposed to excessively strong and muscular looking people like plitt, hall, or [rich piana](https://i.imgur.com/3JH4gOQ.jpg) (and surely you wouldn't argue that he doesn't look stronger than greg plitt, yet most would find him less attractive).

"1. Reserving so many seats is wrong. You have no right to do that.
2. That guy said something very wrong. It's very inappropriate to speak words like ""Going back to your own country "". He was targeting an completely irrelevant issue. So he deserves to be reported.

3.1 and 2 are separate problems.Both sides made mistakes.

What to learn :
1. Don't save so many seats for others. Saving one is not that rude but saving more is really annoying and selfish.
If somebody is late for class, it's their own fault and it's unfair to other students who come early and unable to seat where they like bc you are fking saving seats. If you just want to sit with your friends, well you are adults now it's time to be independent .

2.Be ware of what to say.Be extremely careful with words addressing race, ethnicity, nationality,gender,sexuality, religions, etc. It doesn't matter if you are anti-PC. Knowing when to shut up keeps you away from trouble. You have the freedom of thoughts, but it's impossible to have 100% freedom often speech otherwise the world will be always in war.

"I've been depressed for a long time too. I don't know if it'll help for sure - but my friends have said that Counselling &amp; Health Services have been helpful for them. I tried it and I'm not sure how different I feel. 

I keep trying to look forward to the future. But I don't like most of what I'm doing, but I'm tied to it for external reasons. I'm struggling in school because the field I've chosen shouldn't be the one that I'm in. 

I have passions, but I'm so tired all the time. Last semester I was a lot better mentally. But this semester, I'm too tired to paint or draw or do anything. I started Inktober and then I just missed a day and even though I could easily catch up, I've lost interest in it now. 

I have one best friend here with me in Loo, and she's honestly the rock that's kept me from doing stupid things. But at this point, I'm just making my way through the days, thinking about how hard I worked to get here, only to fuck everything up for myself and ruin my life within 2 years. 

My advice would be to try reaching out to someone or making a friend. It really helps you to get out of bed on a morning. Or get a plant or pet. Knowing that someone or something else relies on me, helps me to make it through the day. I signed up to be a note-taker because even though I believe I'm a piece of shit, others shouldn't have to suffer for my inadequacy.  "

"Could be because many domestic students don't interact much with the Chinese international students.

"A lot of the problem in my experience lies in Society executive transitions. If transition of executives is not done properly then it is easy for information to fall through the cracks and get lost. Better transitions is not an easy solution but having society-respective procedure(s) for Society executives to follow would help standardize the process and reduce information loss. 

Part of the solution is keeping closer Society-Councillor ties and working together closer. Having Councillors show up to their respective Society's meetings will help encourage Society executives to attend the Council meetings. "
"Have they checked your spleen/ liver for enlargement? That should be really easy to do on physical exam.

"Had a database prof in 3rd year who emailed something along the lines of ""it is the classes fault grades are so bad, please stop sending me threats as they will be all sent to authorities"" which was only the last in a long line of very confusing fragmented emails which nobody could understand. 

The real issue being that she did not teach her syllabus and only did theory in a class based in implementing code, and even that was a struggle because she would spend a majority of most classes talking about her pets and children... to a bunch of tired coders. Class got so messed up probably half the class filed complaints and the first time we touched code was after writing a final exam she somehow moved up a week from the original date... There was no logic or strategy to her course structure, it defied her own syllabus and left the entire class with 0 taught knowledge of implementing code. When I filed a complaint, which I have never done before, I got the response from the department head that she is ""just like that"".... She ""stepped down"" the following semester.

Glad/sad to hear it at other universities too. "
"We should tie access to pensions and health care (when you're over 40) to how many children you have. For example, if you have no children you are severely penalized for failing to substantially invest in the countries future, if you have one child there is a minor penalty, and if you have two children then you get full access. It should also be a two-tiered system where people with children also receive quite a bit of aid (and the aid would not increase after three children). Stable family structures are pretty much proven to result in better citizens, since something like absent fathers is highly correlated to anti-social behavior. Clearly love isn't enough to get people to have a replaceable number of children, and positive incentives don't seem to work too well in Europe, so there should also be negative incentives. 

People who have no children due to severe mental handicaps would receive aid under an entirely different system, although this would need to be closely regulated to prevent loopholes (eg. these people would have to be low income since someone with a high income probably isn't handicapped). "
"i mean are you really that vain to literally need the desire to putting someone else down and feeling powerful? 
I get being manipulative and being ""mean"" to advance yourself personally but you really have nothing to gain from that besides that ""powerful"" feeling. In most cases it is objectively better to just, not do that. Im sure you can find other ways to vent for that feeling.

'Being manipulative isn’t being a good person though.""
Not necessarily, by your own definition of a good person, you can manipulate them to do things without negatively impacting them.

""And it often involves fucking someone over/framing them.""
You know, I've been manipulative a few times myself, I never really framed someone by doing it or fucking them over. Manipulating is just convincing people, you don't have to fuck them over lol.

'Moving locations fairly often helps them cause when they gain a bad rep"". Okay realistically speaking what career are you planning on going into which allows you to just freely move locations to prevent you from getting a bad rep somewhere. That sounds completely counterintuitive to ""being successful in your job and well liked everywhere else"".

I'll be honest, it sounds like you think you're living in a movie with all these fuckin outlandish examples. You gotta take a realistic look on your life, most of these situations will probably not occur."

Conversation about and ask about why they chose to take that class. Tell them why you are in those fitness classes and what your goals are.

"My father died when I was in first year and in advance of the midterm I was inevitably going to miss, I sent an email to my professor letting her know, listing the dates that the death notice would be running with my name in it. While most of my professors were incredibly accommodating, I had the same experience. The logistics of obtaining a death certificate in due time, even if you are an immediate family member, can be crushing. Came out with a 50 in the class after the most traumatic trainwreck of a semester, dropped out of university very soon after. I genuinely wish you never have to go through that. "

Housing you can find cheap if you're willing to live in the 'student slums' and have roommates. If you're willing to live in Kitchener, you can also find a relatively affordable 1bdrm apartment too. So that's your call whether you want to live an easy walk to the school or if you don't mind having a short bus ride.

Grocery stores, I personally like going to the Superstore on Fischer Hallman. I really like shopping President's choice, and find Zehrs to be really expensive. There's a No Frills in Kitchener but it sucks ass. Sobeys I find to be expensive. Superstore is a good balance between having good quality produce but also not being ridiculously overpriced.

&amp;#x200B;

Get involved in your department right away. It's always helpful knowing people especially if you need a favour (or to borrow stuff for lab work that wasn't planned etc.). That's one thing that most people I know always complain about is not being 'involved' enough in their department and not knowing anybody. I'm highly introverted and anti-scoial but in my first 6 months here I was at every departmental event just to get to know people/be recognized. It helps in the long run I find. Easier to meet people when you're new and first starting then when you've been here a while and might be stuck in your introverted ways (assuming you're an introverted person like the rest of us) "
"Someone else already mentioned the Feds clubs listing page so I'm going to plug my favourite two:

1. Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ). Sign ups are running this week for the week long game next week. The game is free to join. HvZ is a game of manhunt where humans have to survive a zombie apocalypse while completing objectives on campus. Zombies tag humans to turn them and humans can defend themselves with Nerf blasters or any weapon made entirely of socks. Zombies also revive after 15 minutes so the horde only ever grows. The week long runs from midnight on Monday until the end of the final mission on Friday. All of campus is in play, with some safe zones for things like study areas, dorm rooms, bathrooms, etc. As I mentioned, it is free to participate in the week long, you just have to supply your own blasters/socks. If you're interested, drop by a sign up booth on MC 3rd floor or in STC lobby this week. In addition, the HvZ club also runs occasional minigames on some weekend afternoons. Here's the [FB event for the week long game] (https://www.facebook.com/events/376746749810639) and the [page for the club.](https://www.facebook.com/uwhvz/)

2. Waterloo Science Fiction and Fantasy Club (WatSFiC). Although it does cost $4 to join for a term, you do not have to be a member to attend meetings and events. They have weekly general meetings on Tuesdays at 7 in DWE 2527, mainly dealing with administrative stuff and event announcements.

"Hi u/Limp_Language, thanks for reaching out. Here's something I had to say on the subject from an old thread:

&gt;I supported the proposed bylaw amendment to remove the VP SL and VP Ed's *voting rights at Board*. I think [u/GreenBurette](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreenBurette)  (thanks for the great summary, though!) should update their comment so  as not to be misleading. My reasoning is simple: the Executive Committee  can almost hold a Board hostage or force items through. If someone  doesn't show up to a meeting and they have a director or two in their  pocket, they have all the votes necessary to push through something that  other Directors on Board disagree with wholeheartedly. As the most  unified voting block at Board, it's important that we try to limit their  ability to fuck shit up. If they want to push something through that  they believe is good, now they need to *convince* other members  of the Board. My hope is that the VP SL and VP Ed will put more effort  into persuasive arguments to sway members of the Board, and it heavily  reduces the possibility that Exec can shove a bylaw change or decision  through Board in their favor. 

I would like to add that a good friend of mine asked the President of the company where they have been hired about the topic of Boards, and he said that most Boards he's sat on have only given the President a vote (not even the CFO), because while the exec team is the leading &amp; integral part of the organization, they are no longer part of the shareholder population in their role (while they might've been &amp; extrapolated to even if they represent shareholders by being elected in). In addition to this, the board is suppose to represent the will of the shareholders as well, not just the organizational interests. 

So converting this to the FedS case, we're in a situation where the Executive can exert massive control over the Board, which has, until very recently (maybe 2 years), according to some old Board folks I've talked to, resulted in a Board that exercised the will of the Executive. They have this much control because out of 11 voting members on the Board, 4 of them are Executive. It's not quite a majority, but if directors are not diligent about showing up, or if the exec can get 2 friends onto the Board, then suddenly, 4/11 becomes 4/8 or 6/11, and you have the ability either to stall change or to force something through. Not to say that something wouldn't be voted through anyway, but if it's truly for the benefit of the Federation, then it shouldn't need to be forced through. I think the change to remove voting rights from only the VPSL and the VPEd (Pres and VPOF still *both* get votes) will bring more discussion to the table, and it will protect the Federation in the case of Executive that don't act in good faith or in the best interest of the Federation, in the case where such an Executive team is elected in.

"Alberta is pretty good. Housing/cost of living is much cheaper than GTA and all you're missing out on is downtown Toronto. The mountains are like an hour away where u can hike, ski, mountain bike, etc. I always lol when I see ski hills around here because the toughest routes here are beginner hills in the Rockies. You can also hike up routes that yield in more elevation gain in a km than 15km hiking routes here. 

The reason I left Alberta is because the economy is very dependent on oil and gas. So if either you don't want to work in that industry or prefer job security, there won't be a lot of jobs for you."
"&gt; I have approached several professors over the past month but they either did not respond or they started ghosting on me.

Did you talk to them in person or e-mail them? 

I would not advise the latter because the an academic letter is not just something for you - it's something for the prof too. By writing you a reference letter they are putting their academic reputation on the line, essentially saying ""I have the credentials/expertise to judge if someone can excel in academia, and I endorse /u/ECEISKillingMe"". Even for me, though I have two profs that I know would 100% write my letters, I'm still going to take some time to go back to campus and talk to them in person. 

I would definitely talk to your academic advisors now, even though they may not be the ones to write your letter (Unless you've taken a course with them or they know you well, I don't see why they would), but they can certainly give you advice on how to approach profs. Also time is not on your side now, and even if a prof was willing to write a letter for you, they may not be willing to do it with only a few days notice, so keep trying.

"
"I asked you what your problem was with the 14 words. The words themselves. 

Your reply is based on their origin, muddled with all sorts of other ideas; not the words themselves or their meaning.

Cultural context changes. No one talks about David Lane in any group I'm a part of, which is many. But they all agree with the 14 words, as a phrase which opposes the mass immigration from the third world into Canada at levels which will lead to whites being a minority. That's the general use in modern society, and the words themselves are completely innocuous. So there's no problem. 

By the way, your condescending tone makes you sound like such a fucking bitch... I know all of this already. I just don't care, because I think white people should be thinking about their future in a country that is looking to purposefully make them a minority. That's more important to me than your feelings and conspiracy theories, sorry. 

If you come up with a better way to say ""hey can we just please have our white majority country and enjoy our culture in peace without constant demands from foreigners that we change?"" I'm all ears."
"This comment reminds me of this one time when I was about 13 my moms friend went on a romantic getaway with her husband and left their retarded kid to live with us for a week. He really loved his mom I guess cause he cried and asked for her every night and was sad all the time. I was the one in charge of babysitting him and entertaining him and shit like that cause my mom doesnt like retarded people I think. Anyway one time he said he had to use the washroom. So I said ok go ahead and he did a little retarded jog off to the washroom. About 20 minutes pass and I start to get worried so I knock on the door and ask him if hes ok. No answer. I knock again. Again, no answer. I get a knife from the kitchen and turn the lock from the outside of the washroom. I opened the door and saw him lapping up the toilet water and occasionally dunking his head in. I was about to yell at him for getting water all over the floor but he turned to me and gave me the biggest smile ever. I hadn't seen him happy like that since he came to live with us. So I decided as long as he's enjoying drinking piss water theres no real harm in it."

From my experience writing dozens of essays thats more of an outlier than a rule. I'll admit a TA once hated me and gave me a 75 for something virtually identical to my friend who got a 95...I called bs but what can you do? Still I think in general most profs are fairly reasonable as long as you make a valid argument. High school is way more of a crapshoot.

"I think saving a seat (one seat) is ok if there are still many seats available of the same type. For example. if there are 10 seats in the front row available, and you are the only one there, then saving a seat for someone is completely fine. 

But if those seats start getting occupied, say there are now 6/10 seats taken, then no you should not be saving seats. 

IMO if 60% of the seats in a particular region is being taken up, you should no longer save seats for anyone.

another solution is just to be like me andn ot go to class so you dont have to save seats for anyone, nor will anyone save a seat for you

Does illegally pulling a fire alarm restrict a speech? These ANTIFA/socialist types aren't talking about some peaceful protest. They want to directly prevent people from speaking.

"I was not speaking about ""white"" heritage. I only identify as white in a hyper diverse race-obsessed scenario since people need to simplify things in order to attempt to make sense of their surroundings. I simply find it disconcerting that people feel so threatened by the very idea of people who are white having a heritage that they do not wish to abandon in exchange for a vacuous decades old social movement which by most metrics is destined to fail sooner rather than later.

I'm neither of those things, not German either. 

&gt;White people not produce, mass migration, etc

There is very real social pressures (for numerous reasons) that discourages people from having children and encourages people to instead expend energy socializing people into their way of doing things by other means. How else can you explain the unsustainable below replacement birth-rates which is clearly a mark of a failing society. Alex Jones doesn't have any real strategies on how to approach these matters, and is merely a useful idiot who can perhaps make people aware that our current trajectory is a losing one. "

"So much research is involved with picking who you think should represent us.  With alll the bias and bad stuff that’s being spewed all over the internet.  Don’t really give a crap because we’re fucked either way. Like the last federal election, with doug ford, liberals and mdp. All parties sucked ass.  And frankly I’ve got one too many midterms and lab reports that I gotta write, which won’t get done for me by picking a candidate which would better suit us.  

Maybe next time, when there are politicians who actually want to help the citizens of this country instead of pushing their personal agenda.  "
"To be fair, there's some courses where you can do these types of ""coups"", you just need everyone involved.  

Last term I had a course where our lab mark (40% overall) was based on: 

{Higher of two exam class averages} + {Lower of two exam class std Dev} * {Your average lab mark std Dev from class average lab mark}

It's pretty easy to see that if nobody hands in a single lab, and nobody writes the assignment, we'd all get the same lab mark, and if it's an easy enough final with a high enough class average, we could likely all pass with minimal work.  

Honestly I regret not convincing everyone asap to do it."
"yes, you should try to get every question correct. What I meant was, CS exams are not like Math exams. I'm in 4th year, so I've done many CS exams - They are designed to be long, most people do not finish these exams.

Regarding fewer errors, I would check your written code with some tests. Not just random tests, but edge cases ie. large inputs, negative number, etc. depending on the question.

CS 135, 136 exams are not hard, just long. I would suggest looking through the whole exam in the beg. to see what you're getting into so you can utilize your time better. If you have other questions, feel free to PM me."
"&gt;Our prof just told is the midterm average last year was 30%.

He does it to convince you to work harder and to take more time to learn the material.

&gt; Wtf lol?

30% is actually too low, 50-55% is more the usual (it gets curved from there). It might be low last year cus the prof messed up and made the last midterm question waaay too hard (it was 20 marks and everyone got either 0 or 1 lmao).

&gt;I'm also doing pretty horribly on the quizzes, how can I pass this course

If the prof is confusing, read the textbook and make note of all the key concepts. All of those will definitely come in to play during the exams; you'll get brand new questions and you'll need to use your concepts to figure out how to work them out.

Also, when review sections pop up later in the course go to all of them and you'll feel much better about the course.

GL and welcome to ECE"
"Yeah sure, but in practice with the distinct majors most people just refer to themselves as a Stats/ActSci/CS/etc. major, rather than a 'math' major. The advantage of having the disjoint majors means you get a much more tailored degree to your interests and you avoid being bogged down by unrelated courses. Plus most of our majors don't exist at the undergraduate level at other schools, so comparing curriculums between different programs (i.e. Math VS Act Sci) is a bit moot.

A major reason why the student emphasis shifted so much to CS and Stats is largely a reflection of the job market demand. Co-op makes students a lot more in tune with what skills are current and so there is always fluctuations in enrolment sizes. I don't have headcount data but I think its fairly indisputable that the rapid growth in CS and Stats is pretty recent; previously basically everyone in math wanted to do ActSci and now with the emergence of data science we are seeing a bit of a shift away from that. Regardless of your math major, everyone takes the same foundational courses which still cover most of the applicable aspects of math. "
"To miss an exam you'll need a form called the Verification of Illness(VIF - Link: [https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/uploads/files/VIF-online.pdf](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/uploads/files/VIF-online.pdf)). Usually you can get a doctor or a counsellor to fill one out for you. Since your midterm is on Monday and the campus services aren't open I suggest you go to a walk in doctor tomorrow(search walk in clinic on google maps or see here [https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/health-and-wellness/walk-in-clinics.aspx](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/health-and-wellness/walk-in-clinics.aspx)). **PLEASE GO SEE A DOCTOR TOMORROW I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT PLEASE TRY.** A PROFESSOR HAS NO OBLIGATION TO BELIEVE YOUR WORD ABOUT YOUR ILLNESS AND SOME OF THEM CAN BE QUITE MEAN ABOUT IT TOO BUT IF YOU HAVE A VERIFICATION OF ILLNESS FORM COMPLETED FROM A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL YOU WILL BE OKAY. So tomorrow go see a walk in doctor tell them what's been going on and ask them to complete the Verification of Illness form and then send this to your academic advisor(you could ask them to fill it out later too it's not important but you NEED TO SEE THEM BEFORE OR DURING YOUR MIDTERM). Make an appointment with your academic advisor, counseling services, and health services on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

Also please be honest with yourself right now. If your depression has gotten to the point where you're not able to function in society are you sure you can finish the rest of the term? **You can still withdraw from the term right now and get 50% of your tuition back(see link:** [**https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates/2018-2019**](https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates/2018-2019)**)**. If you do this all your courses this term will be replaced with a WD(withdrawn) and you'll only have to tell people you withdrew for mental health reasons. Be honest with yourself. Are you at risk of failing some courses, many courses or all your courses? If you are it's so much better to have WDs on your record than fails. Please be honest with yourself if you don't have this under control withdraw now(email your academic advisor) get your 50% tuition refund and work on your mental health for the rest of the term. Come back when you're better and healthier. **Mental health is no joke.** If you got a physical illness that prevented you from doing your work you would probably withdraw right? Why not do it with mental health. I understand it's difficult and there's parental pressure and peer pressure but the alternative is so much worse. There are so many people at this university that go into a spiral down. Know that this is an option.

"Because it undermines our democracy. Trollman\_falcon is exaggerating but there's significant precedent for politicians shipping in people with similar interests to secure their seat.

"Not something people have brought up before to my knowledge, but since Spring is already a short-term I am inclined to say this won't likely happen (not that it cannot).

Ain't no way my ass is getting turnt if I have a midterm or important assignments to do on thursday/friday.

"I’ve had the same experience. Doctors (especially my family doctor) kept attributing my condition/pain to stress and think I was overreacting.

The symptoms continued and I got so depressed because of it I think of death all day and lost motivation for basically everything. One day I had a breakdown in front of my mom...she encouraged me to be persistent and told me to stand strong for myself. I did that and I’m under treatment now.

"I’ll just add to angerygoosepopo’s recommendation for MATH135 on proofs.

Try working through some of the examples (and even theorems!), either from lectures or any of the recommended texts, on your own, even if you have a faint idea of what the proof should be. As you try to prove these statements, try not to refer to your notes first, even if it’s for some theorem or proposition that you may need. Think about how you would prove the statement using your own ideas instead.


When you feel lost going forward on a proof, think about what would immediately lead to the conclusion of which you wish to prove. There may be several ways, but just pick any of them and ask yourself the same question again. At every stage, look back at your assumption(s) and see if you can make a connection to your last answer from there.

Note that that doesn’t work 100% of the time; some proofs require certain tricks, or some “non-obvious”, subtle steps. These can either be gained through experience, by trial-and-error, a spark of genius, or simply by how well you understand the “structure” of and/or around the statement."
"My biggest complaint is that it's a little dense and hence kind of difficult to read.   Because of how it's formatted, the rightmost column feels like one giant block, even though you have three sections. To fix both of these issues, you'll need to remove content.

I would suggest removing the MIT battlecode competition and Junior Achievement's Company program. While cool, these don't actually add much to your resume in terms of your qualifications/skills, and are a little outdated too. Likewise, I would suggest taking out your supervisor of Senior Robotics from your Other Experience section for the same reasons.

That should give you some extra room to work with. Increase the spacing in and between sections so the resume is easier on the eyes and allows the recruiter to find useful information more easily. [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-resume/bjryvfsjdyxz) is an example of a nicely-formatted two column resume. See how all of the sections clearly stand out? Even though there's a lot of content, it doesn't *feel* that dense. There's no need to reinvent the wheel here -- I would suggest using a template. If you used a template when making this resume, find a different one. 

From your left column: remove the honor roll from the awards section. This is Waterloo engineering, so they know you did well in high school. All of your competition had good marks in high school too, so this doesn't add anything that will help you stand out. 

Likewise, remove the interests section. This doesn't add anything substantial to your resume but makes it feel more crowded.  

I would also suggest killing the soft skills section because these are kind of generic ""qualifications"" that are too subjective to help the employer pick a candidate. However, there is a notable exception: if the job posting asks for specific soft skills, include those **matching the phrasing of the job posting as closely as possible**. This is an easy way to show the employer that you read the posting carefully and actually tailored the resume for the posting. 

But yeah. TL;DR: remove stuff, make it less crowded, use a template.

Good luck!"

If sex differences in interest are a result of a hegemonic, patriarchal and sexist society and the gender stereotypes instilled by it (the status quo assumption), then gender equity movements are sound in that by removing these sociocultural influences, representation would improve.

Of course, this does not consider the fact that these differences may have, at least in part, an innate basis. The left is generally oblivious to this, but humans are clearly not blank slates, and the axiom of ""all differences are sociocultural"" is clearly not correct.

Here's a few compelling pieces of evidence as to why sex differences might be rooted more in nature (instead of nurture) than the left realizes.

1. In studies where very young infants who have had zero exposure to any sociocultural messages (which controls for the effects of nurture) are presented stereotypically boy or girl toys, boys are significantly more likely to play with the ""boy toy"" and vice versa. [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/icd.1986)

2. In the most gender egalitarian societies (such as the Nordic countries), gender differences in occupation, education and interest actually *increase*. This directly contradicts the sociocultural hypothesis, which would expect to find gender differences to be the most striking in oppressive, sexist countries. It appears to be that the more privileged and well-off societies become, the more men and women feel free to choose to pursue what they want to do. [link](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/)

3. Literally all of evolutionary psychology, which explains sex differences as the result of adaptation due to differential reproductive strategies. Women have to nurture kids, men need to acquire resources blah blah blah

Of course, I don't deny that sociocultural effects do exist in dissuading women from pursuing STEM fields. They obviously do. Every woman should feel confident in their ability to pursue STEM, because they are clearly capable (there's no meaningful differences in IQ or competence). I empathize with the fact that the lack of representation can be daunting and deterring. 

But the left needs to stop instinctively attributing this lack of representation to sexism completely. I have a problem with the gender equity movements that operate under the false axiom that disparities are 100% the result of sociocultural factors, and the push for equality of outcome that logically follows this."

And only so many scooters can be placed at specific points so if another juicer beats you to it you have to find another place to drop it off, while it is losing charge. Also some batteries suck and start losing charge quickly so you can't get it to a location before you get a penalty."

"We can make a statement of at least for the average mark though.

If we have absolute consistency of average mark, then the average mark will be the lowest possible to attain the gpa. (for this case it's an 80 in everything).

"I had seen coursehero referenced in other past threads and I made the assumption they had some legitimacy.  As far as having a paywall does that make the option illegitimate?  Many students pay for some form of tutoring/textbooks/workbooks/tutorial information and I would consider this type of content to be a part of such, and probably cheaper then most.

Edit: I went to the coursehero site and also did some internet searches.  It seems that most of their content is legitimate, costs are pretty modest and they provide a lot of ways for students to access content for free.  I think were I needing info in a hurry, and this having the ability to provide some instantaneous relevant content I would not dismiss it out of hand.

"They /u/Doulich your current Council thought that policy was dumb too! We reformed things substantially this year and are still working on it. That policy is set to no longer be in force effective no later than 21 October, 2018. Council voted on this rescission on our 16th September meeting.

Also as an aside, the GM can do much much more than bylaw or policy related stuff (and should). Generally, as an organization, we should not change our bylaws too much (and right now Board has unchecked power to do that until a GM ratifies them). This policy was originally intended as a stop-gap measure to prevent Board from passing bylaw changes that would hurt the students or let the Federation do something without consulting students or their representatives because in the past Board have done so.

I was part of the bylaws amendments team this year that led a comprehensive re-write of the bylaws to increase accountability of the Board to Council and the membership, and to increase the accountability of the Council to students. As part of this, we lowered the threshold for removal of directors, lowered the threshold to initiate recall referenda for Councillors and Executives, added online voting for General Meetings, and restricted the Board's right to change the bylaws without consulting with students or Council and without direct approval from the GM. 

If you have questions let me know! I've been part of the team of Councillors, Directors, and at-Large members of the GM's ordered Task Force looking into and recommending changes to our current model to make the organization more accountable to the student shareholder/member. "

"Yup, I agree with you. I don't smoke. 

My problem with a policy like this though is what I listed above:

&gt; MAJOR ISSUE: Section 9 Paragraph 2: This is an asinine power move that cripples students' rights. The entire paragraph needs to be scratched. The paragraph in question: **""In the event any individual is in serious or repeated violation of this policy, or fails to pay a ticket issued under this policy, the University may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy the University may have at law or under University policy, take further action in the form of discipline, withholding of student records, removal/ban from campus or referral of accounts to a collection agency.""**


That standard is fucked and unappealable. I think it's genuinely inappropriate for the Uni to do something like that notwithstanding the rights of students to appeals and due process."

"Hi! I did an NSERC supported job (though it wasn't directly research in a lab, it was for a food company and I was given a project that could qualify for NSERC funding) and I submitted my NSERC application a couple of weeks into the work term since I was waiting on my transcript/grades to be finalized. So I think I submitted it around January 20th for the winter term co-op. My friend who did research at Waterloo as well qualified for the NSERC funding but she didn't apply until mid-May for the summer term. You may want to double check when you have to apply by just in case you can get a bit more time to think it over!"

You're sort of...just...ghosting these people that keep messaging you.

"I think you should be good if you're already familiar with most of the content and even if not it's fairly easy. 

I took it a couple terms ago with another prof and the lectures were too early in the morning to go to. I was already familiar with some of the content though. The midterm was on the same day as another much harder midterm, so I couldn't spend any time studying for the CS 330 one. The CS 330 midterm was at like 9 am or something and I had been studying for the other one until 8:25 am. I made some food and looked over the slides for about 15 minutes before heading to write it. Got like an 80, so if you spend any proper amount of time studying you should be able to do better. There were a couple of trick questions so look out for them, though it might be prof dependent. If you need clarification on anything, there are tons of videos out there on the topics. "
"Ah but that is exactly what happens... a woman who behaves this way has two options:

1. Admit her behavior is shameful and was a huge mistake.

2. Insist, or at least hope, that others support her actions. And if they don't, many of them get quite aggressive.

And the ""slut walk"" types you'll find at the Women's center and whatnot who push promiscuity as an empowering ideal are definitely like this. There are celebrities like this, magazines like Cosmo and Seventeen etc. push the same message, it's essentially mainstream now from what I can tell.

There's a great saying I picked up along the way, I'm not sure where I heard it, but it sums up exactly what I think of this behavior. 

&gt; A man tries to climb a mountain, but does not reach the top. He goes back to the bottom, thinks about what he did wrong and plans to climb it again when he is better prepared.

&gt; A woman tries to climb the mountain, and also doesn't make it to the top. But rather than go back down and re-think her strategy, she simply declares the point where she is to be the top of the mountain.

You'll see this all over the place from women. From the fat acceptance movement (I'm already beautiful!) to the promiscuous sluts (I don't want to be married and have kids anyway!)

"I have had the opportunity to TA courses as physics lab I would say the biggest struggle I saw in undergrads was their ability to understand the concept and explain it simply. I would suggest ensuring you first understand the concept using limit samples, then applying that to understanding the math. 

My favorite example is torque. The concept of torque is that a force applied to an object perpendicular to the axis that goes through the axis of rotation will cause that object to move about the rotation axes. Ok so that sounds complicated. Here is an example instead. If I push on a door, the door at the door knob, the door will rotate about it's rotation, or the hinges. If I instead push the door half way between the hinges and the door, it will still rotate, but it takes more force to rotate. If I were to push at the hinges, the door would not rotate!  That's because my force is going through the rotation axis. Ok so now let's say I go to the edge if the door, and I push on the edge where the lock mechanism is, the door also doesn't move, because my force is pointing through the door and through the rotation axis. So in the first part I varied the distance away from the rotation axis, the second part I varied the direction only force. Now T = r x F or T = rFsin(theta) makes sense. Let r = 0, or your distance away from the hinge, and apply a huge amount of force, you'll never see that door swing, or let r = inf but  your force is pointing toward the rotation axis, theta equals 0, and that door will never move. 

Simple examples, and limits have been the most fruitful method to build a physics intuition, in fact I still use this method when I'm trying to understand a new concept. Looking at an equation and evaluating the limits, then putting that limit in context of an example is a very good way of understanding in my opinion. While course work is trying to get this idea across, I don't believe it is explicitly stated as a strategy for learning physics.

Finally, and this post got away from me but meh, I think building an intuition of how something behaves is the most important part of a physics degree, it gives you the confidence to approach any problem, as well as alleviates cramming for an exam, because instead of memorizing, you understand, which when approaching a problem means you can think about that problem instead of trying to recall a formula.

Long story short, ensure you understand the concept and evaluate the limits of that concept. Also think of what those limits should be before you figure out the answer, so you can understand the actual behavior, even if you were completely wrong. This all helps you understand.

"First, don't believe anyone who tells you there's nothing the average student can do (or even, a step further, the average person in politics). That kind of rhetoric breeds the apathy that rears its ugly head in the form of phrases like, ""but I'm just one person"" or ""There's no way that I can change things alone"". The big truth is that *you're not alone*. If you feel this way, then I'm sure there are others who do as well. /rant

Now that my rant is done, I'll address the meat of your question. If you don't go to Bomber, don't use any clubs, services, or work with any societies, my first question is: ""Why not?"" While it's true that not everything will appeal to everybody, there is so much variety, and if you spend a couple seconds looking for something, there's surely *something* that interests you. Hell, if you can't find it, then why not *make it?* A good friend of mine in First Year started a [Belegarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belegarth_Medieval_Combat_Society) club because that was something in which FedS was deficient. If all you want to do is study, and you don't use any of FedS services, etc. then it's true you might benefit less from the FedS fee. However, the Federation still advocates to the University, the government, and external organizations on behalf of *all* undergraduate students, so you're benefiting from that. It's almost exactly like being part of a mandatory union when you enter the workforce - not all of the benefits you reap are immediately apparent, but benefits exist that wouldn't otherwise without the union.

You cannot refund your FedS fee. However, if you strongly believe that the Federation is not serving your best interests and/or you don't want to be associated with them you have a couple of real options:

* Write a letter to the Chair of the Board and request withdrawal from the membership. This is more of an action taken by principle, and you realize absolutely no benefit, unless you consider less affiliation with the Federation a benefit. I don't think this has been done in recent history, and I do not recommend following this option because it is immediately inferior to the other option:
* GET INVOLVED. I can't stress enough how important this option is or how easy it is just to get involved. If you care about students or student life or advocacy or whatever else, you can channel that to your and other people's benefits. Students aren't stupid, and they can tell when someone is really passionate about something. People with passion about this kind of thing tend to get in easily. All you have to do is run in elections, apply to positions, or harass your councilors. This Reddit thread has given you people you can contact (anonymously, on Reddit if you want) if you have concerns or issues with the Federation. u/GreenBurette has put an immense amount of effort into answering questions (thanks, btw), and I am sure they would be happy to let you know more about getting involved with FedS Council. Winter is election season for Council, Board of Directors, and Executive, so get ready for the upcoming term because **you** can get involved. Talk to your constituency, reach out to your Society, speak with your Councillors. Hell, you can even find the FedS exec during their office hours and talk to them about how to make services better or more accessible for you. We're all just trying to improve the Federation, and your input helps us do just that. "

"A lot of programs are only offered as 'honours' degrees, but when there's an option it usually just mean you need more credits (i.e. specialization) in the subject area versus a non-honours degree. You get less electives in other areas compared to a non-honours degree, so less breadth and more depth.

The course calendar is typically the place to go to for the details."
"Before Waterloo my experience with Asians was with ones that grew up in Toronto and went to gifted programs with me. I had a great opinion of Asians overall as perfect at assimilating but being more driven and conservative than the locals. After a year and a half at Waterloo, few things here annoy me more than a flock of internationals blocking MC entrance and smoking."
"If you don't mind everything being handwaved (especially in ""math"" courses), go with SE.

If you want to actually understand theory, CS is probably better.

That being said, dropping from SE to CS is trivial, so if you're really not sure, just go with SE.

Also, take a look at the courses for each program (note the physics and chemistry courses you have to take in SE)."

"A doctor once kept brushing off my pain related illness, until one day I put my foot down.

Literally walked into the office and said “I’m not leaving until you refer me to a specialist.” And I had a list of specialists to contact. Within TWO DAYS of saying that to him, I was at a specialists office. And lo and behold, the specialist confirmed my pain related illness, and I received treatment for four months after. Not completely better, but a whole lot better than before.

Doctors do know best, but it never hurts to TRY to see a specialist. Be wary about experimenting with medication or suggesting surgery though!"

Lot's of people feel, or have felt, like your describing. You're not alone. The feeling you described is familiar to me, and I know many others who can empathize with the feeling as well. The only advice I feel qualified to give is to recommend you talk to someone. The UW-Mates link provided by the friendly autobot in this thread would be a good place to try.   


Also, try not to be too hard on yourself. Feeling depressed or feeling a lack of purpose is something that millions of people go through, it doesn't mean that you're lazy or spoiled.

"Per procedure, there is a threshold (I think 2 unexcused absences or 4 total absences) at which a councillor is vulnerable to be expelled. At that point, such absences will be announced during each meeting and any councillor can move for an expulsion vote (which would occur by secret ballot).

At the September meeting, 5 councillors (including 3 society presidents) were vulnerable to expulsion. A expulsion vote was held for the 2 elected councillors which led to one of them being expelled (the other explained that the meetings during the spring term conflicted with a job but that it would not be an issue going forward)."
"i guess i can see it being useful to train your balance/core and i'm not a figure skater but from my view it seems that the risks out weigh the rewards.

"&gt; Be yourself, but the way I am now no one would like me

I didn't mean be depressed and a narcissist etc.. be the best version of yourself you can be. You have certain limits, and a certain personality. Roll with it.

&gt; Alright, but do you really think you’d feel the same way about makeup if you just went on a date with an ugly girl who didn’t wear makeup?

idk, I have been attracted to some girls that others might consider ugly. This one redhead I dated comes to mind, she was very natural like this as well, a hippie type. Sure she could have looked ""better"" to Cosmo magazine standards if she wore makeup, and she was a bit chubby but she was gorgeous to me and an awesome person so... I think my answer to this is yes, because by not wearing makeup you will probably avoid fuck bois. 

&gt; Yea sure don’t wear makeup if you’re hot shit, but I look even worse without it. 

Well makeup ruins your skin so that's no surprise. You can still take care of your skin and hair etc. as women have for thousands of years in various ways. Suffocating your skin with a layer of chemicals and animal products 10 hours a day certainly won't give you nice skin. It's actually an absurd practice when you think about it, and its roots in prostitution should be worrying. 

I've seen girls in religious communities who don't wear makeup and aren't too attractive to me personally, but they have a beautiful family and they look happy. I've seen Sikh women who follow the teaching of never shaving their hair and have unibrows or mustaches, and they are happily married.. an extreme case, of course, but I'm trying to make a point.

No problem."

Have Hawaiian themes, and other stuff. It shouldn’t be difficult to fill a nightclub on such a large campus but it is because the idiots in charge elected to try for Wednesday as their big night.

In terms of improving restaurant income, make it known for something. I don’t particularly like any of their food and there’s never any specials so why would I go? Host wings nights on mondays/thursdays where the wing prices are reduced but you must buy at least on drink - this helps compensate for the reduced spending. Have taco tuesdays.

"Is it through something like HireVue? 

I did one earlier this week, not for Apotex. there were about 4 video questions, the rest were MC or short written questions (mostly about eligibility to work). One thing I found tricky was that not all questions were 3 minutes as in the practice video, I was answering a 2 minute question and then realized I was running out of time"
"You have to state your family's income as that determines your funding. I think maybe if the family is like super super rich then you won't be eligible for any funding? I'm not 100% sure, maybe if your family income is 200k+ then you aren't eligible for anything. Personally I was still eligible for 6k in loans per year and then like 2k in grants despite my family income."
"Conor didnt change much in his shit talk game since Mayweather except for adding religion into it. He shit talked the whole Mayweather family name and brand and they still squashed beef in the ring. Being called a terrorist is probably the least insulting thing Conor and his has said about Khabibs religion too but thats what set him off post fight. Apologising doesnt make actions go away. Khabib scarred his flawless and respectable career so fast with actions far lower than any of Conors previous doings on him. 3 on 1 jumping on Conor and assault on Conors team, luckily those 3 were released as Conor didnt press charges. "
"Seems normal. Lots of things can make you feel like this. Two possibilities off the top of my head: 

&gt; You might be aromantic and the fact that other people are showing you romantic attraction puts you off - You might just need to find someone who is agreeable and also wants a non-romantic significant other.

&gt; Having standards/requirements that aren't common here - not a bad thing; and you don't need to compromise on what you want as long as you recognize it's gunna make you wait a longer. (But it might be worth it to wait for a better guy because compromising on your standards might make you feel really badly!)

"The workload of Feds Exec is such that it's really impossible to have a full course workload or be full time students. If you think about it; that's 12 months of full time work with rent and life expenses where they can't really justify using student loans, etc, because they're taking a year off to work. If I was facing 12 months of full time work where I couldn't take classes I wouldn't want to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the conversation is about ""is their work worth being paid"" then the answer is it's up to us, the students, and the councillors, to keep them accountable and make sure they're doing work worth being paid. "
"What program are you in

edit: by your comment history you say you’re a student at U of T. First term waterloo students in CS, ECE, and SE generally get software development or QA jobs first term (I think like 10-20% fail to get jobs). I’d say if you have a shred of experience you’ll get a dev job, otherwise you’re probably stuck with QA or something really shitty. Just from observation 80% of SE kids get dev jobs first term, idk about other programs. Almost no one gets a major name company first co-op, whereas second co-op I already know a few people with offers from companies you’ve definitely heard of before."
"You will eventually not want to be alone and by then all that's left is single moms and divorced women. Start early. Do you really believe you would be happier with a great job and no gf than a good job and gf? Most successful people can do both btw it's not impressive if you do well in one area of your life by completely ignoring others

EDIT: oh yea and also, the extra income you get from having a partner would easily make up for anything you lose by having a slightly worse career. But nobody is gonna want to promote you anyways if you're the weird guy in the office who sits in the corner and the only one without a wife"
"CBC here. There's been quite a few incidents where I've witnessed international students band up together in various classes and talk loudly about other classmates in Mandarin (myself included) when I can understand perfectly what they're saying. This kind of behaviour makes them seem unfriendly and unapproachable, like an ""us vs. them"" attitude. Combined with the fact that many of them are indeed rich, they might feel like they are superior to or don't have much in common with the average domestic student and not want to/won't bother to approach us. It goes both ways though since domestic students won't feel inclined to approach them either because they simply can't relate (language, culture, etc.). I understand that not all international Asian students are like this and that we shouldn't lump everyone in the same boat, but this seems to be a common theme I'm witnessing. "
"So disappointed and upset after writing that. The first 20 questions I found to be pretty fair, but most of the rest of the questions were an absolute shitshow for me. The rest of the questions were just straight up memorization off of the most tiny details from the slides instead of any questions that actually test your understanding of concepts. After doing all of the practice quizzes and receiving 85+ on my first attempt without using any notes and getting almost every clicker question right in class and thoroughly reviewing and studying all of what I thought was actually testable (not the most tiny details that were barely touched on in class), I can safely say I probably got a 50 on that midterm. Such a slap in the face after studying so much content that wasn't even covered and instead being tested on random straight memorization details.

"Well personally from working in retail sales and having to pay attention to traffic+potential customers, I notice that there are indeed a shit ton of xMAF couples out there, the majority of those x=W, but only a few I might see or interact with theres a noticeable chance that the dudes only with the girl because shes Asian. But I think a lot of people look at such a trend and just call it yellow fever and hiss and boo at the all the men in those relationships. Plus for guys who have a decent amount of past asian partners who are asian people automatically assume its yellow fever, but really preference is just a preference and i think it just becomes bullshit for guys and asian girls to have to deal with the negative stigma of whats come to be known as ""yellow fever"".  Where is the line drawn between calling out someone for having a fetish and feeling bad for all asian girls in interracial relationships?

Not to deny its existence because the situation you just described definitely occurs, but i think the term can shame an asian girl who has a non-asian partner just as much as it can make a guy look like a fetishistic prick."

"I’m an exam marker for 291. Many students lost tons of marks just because they didn’t READ THE QUESTIONS PROPERLY. Before you answer things, take the time to read and understand the questions.

Highlight important info and requirements if you need to. 

I recommend sticking it out. The profs aren’t trying to trick you w the questions they’re asking. Just study hard, do the practice problems, take the time to read the questions, and you’ll be good. "
"The Greyhound is to be avoided whenever you can. They're extremely unreliable with their times, the buses are mediocre and they oversell tickets so buying one doesn't even guarantee that you'll get on.

If you want a reliable time you can take the go bus to Square one and transfer to Toronto from there. It's a sure shot of 2ish hours compared to Greyhound's listed 1.5 hours, but Greyhound has a high chance of being hours late with no apologies."

Now onto my (irrelevant to this post) opinion on whether buying girls drinks works or not, I think it's a pretty bad strategy. If I had to guess, I'd say 90% of girls who would let you buy them a drink at a club, either straight up want free drinks or the validation that comes with it. I can't count how many times a girl bragged about not paying for any drinks all night. It's sometimes even seen as a competition between girls. Basically the odds are low that she's actually interested.

Favours, I'd say it never works. It's something friends do, if anything it makes you look more as a friend than a potential romantic interest (which is great, if you're not interested in her)"
"Both of those courses vary a bunch depending on who's teaching it!

This term 150 is being taught by 3 grad students (I think?) who rotate between the 3 sections. My section has done value drawings, contour drawings, portraits, collages, and performance art with charcoal on big sheets of kraft paper (collaborative and individual). Upcoming projects include stop motion, paintings, zines, repeat patterns, cyanotypes, etc. So far all the assignments have been in class, but you're free to spend more time if you want.

100 I found was more technical since it's a course intended for fine art majors, but we still had lot of room for  creativity. I took it with Linda Carson and I remember doing figure studies/life drawings (I think this term they did wire sculptures too?), portraits, perspective drawings, collages, paper sculptures, stop motion and a lot of other stuff but I can't remember right now lol. I took it because I heard the assignments would be in-class, but that wasn't the case with my prof so I ended up spending a lot of outside time working on projects :'(

I think 100 was more technical, and 150 seems more... experimental? Both are very basic courses in the sense that they don't assume you have very in-depth art knowledge. If you walk around ECH throughout the term, you can actually see the assignments of current students :) Feel free to PM me if you have more questions."
"Hey man, I grew up in a troubled family. I was always a smart kid at school however troubles at home held me down, and by junior high my attendance and grades began to drop. My mental health was suffering and I was in denial. Having gone through all sorts of child abuse, physically, emotionally, and mentally, I didnt know it was affecting me. By highschool I was so depressed. I didnt graduate with my class. Was capable of being a top student however I would burn out half way through the semester due to not confronting my mental health. I took a year off and I am now coming back to school to finish up. Funny, I was at the worst place of my life a few months ago, suicide was always lingering my mind, I lost someone precious to me, however I began confronting my mental health. Funny thing is, at  the start of the school year, I got into a car accident (2 weeks after I got it) 3 car pile up, I was at fault, totalled my car. Came out in one piece and somehow no concussion even though I have my doubts here in there. It taught me a valuable lesson and its almost like it cured my depression. I wasnt even upset knowing it was going to cost me thousands in the long run. It taught me that life is a piece of shit but either way, you got to keep moving forward. Enjoy the ups and downs in life. I have down days here and there now, but I feel way better. I dont know if the whiplash balanced my brain chemicals somehow but its crazy how life events can change somebody.

I am now working my hardest to change my habits and Im doing better than ever at school. Not the greatest attendance wise, but Ive done better than ever. Currently sitting in low 90s hoping to get it into the highs. The more time passes, the better I am getting. 

I am hoping to apply to UW CS and SE this year. Im from Alberta they take top 5 (Math 30-1, Math 31, Chemistry, Physics, then English). My grades other than english are averaging out to mid 90s, however I am taking english in the second semester and my predicted grade will be 50 since thats what I got in grade 11. I know Ill do better in grade 12 but I was wondering how that may affect my application? (Teacher for that class was cancerous, went to a highly reputated highschool and all the students with that teacher averaged in the high 50s)

Anyways thanks for listening ! Sorry this was very long however shoot me a message if you'd like to let it out as well :), take care"
"Hey, I hope you're doing alright. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, I hope you feel better soon.

I'm most likely quite a bit younger than you (1A), and my situation was completely different than yours. But, I hope I can share something that will be of use to you. 

I lost my dad in Grade 12, before coming here. October 12th of last year, specifically. He was ill for the majority of my life, however when it happened, it was still a huge shock to me. I still managed to do pretty well senior year, but it was mostly because I a) wanted to make him proud/really wanted to come here myself, and b) brushed it aside and distracted myself from what happened. It was hard. Except I wasn't super close with him, since I didn't see him often after my parents divorced a couple years prior. So, it didn't hit me as hard as it would for someone like yourself. I can only imagine the pain you feel right now. 

My advice:

1. For the next long while, you're going to breakdown. A lot. For the first couple weeks, I broke down almost every night. It's going to happen. Personally, I enjoy letting myself cry it all out for however long you need to, and then going back to work. This way, you can both acknowledge your own emotions and then carry on for the next while. It hurts a lot, and it will for a long time. But eventually, it will get better. Take it easy, if you're really having an awful day, take a break. 
2. Reach out. Talk to anyone who you're comfortable enough with. Ideally, someone who you don't have to filter yourself with.  It really helps having someone to vent to. For me, this was my girlfriend. She helped me a lot, and would let me scream or cry about it whenever I needed to. Hopefully you have someone who could also fill this role for you, whether it's a family member or a friend.
3. Do your best to maintain whatever healthy habits you had prior. Again, it will be hard. But do your best to eat well, sleep lots, and exercise if you can! I'm a little bit of a hypocrite (I don't exercise), but it does help.
4. Don't push yourself too hard. If you're having a real shitty day, and you want to just stay home for the day, do it. Forcing yourself to go to class generally isn't a good idea. It'll worsen your mood, and you most likely won't remember anything from it.
5. It will get better. It will take time, but you will heal, and you will be alright. Although I am nowhere near my future goals, I would still like to think I'm doing pretty well. I got into one of the more competitive eng programs here at UW, and I'm doing well academically (so far). My mental health is much better, and I feel genuinely content with life. For the time being, try your best to not compare yourself to others, or to your previous standards. Accept the fact that this period of your life will just simply be slower than others' in terms of any personal or professional development. It'll help you feel a bit better, and know that you will come out of this okay :)

OP, I'm not sure if you'll be reading these. I hope you do. Again, I'm sorry for your loss, I wish you and your family the best. If you want to talk about anything, PM me, I would be more than happy to chat with you."

&gt;Our data couldn’t find even a single woman that preferred weaker or feminine male bodies

&gt;The findings runs counter to a theory that has been gaining traction in the field of male attractiveness research, that there exists a “sweet spot” for brawn, and that beyond a certain threshold too much strength becomes unappealing.

"Yes but my point is that the promotion makes it seem like anyone from any prpgram is gonna get such an amazing coop experience and SV and $40 coops are just steps away when you get to UW for any program but its just not true.

Whats the point of going to a school that doesnt give a shit about you if even your coop opportunities are sub par? 

And i mean regardless of how disputable my reasoning is for my claim it still holds true to OPs question. I wish someone told me that coop here would be bullshit if i wasnt in math eng or cs. The postings ive seen from the program i was in + examples of what people done were shit compared to what i heard from people who did coops in the other areas of sTEM"
"I’ll start by saying I have no idea if you have depression and that the main point of this post is to let you know that you’re not alone. I don’t know, but it seems like you may have some issues that are inflamed by stress.  I do know that the feeling of ‘if I could get on track then I could stay on track’ seems to be common. Depression from being ‘off track’ is sometimes called situational depression and is a actually a common reason for prescribing anti-depressants. The idea is that you (hopefully) find an anti-depressant that works for you, take it while you’re getting back on track and then wean yourself off of it.
It’s also worth noting that not all clinical depression is due to a chemical imbalance. It also seems that reduced activity in part of the prefrontal cortex can have terrible effects on motivation in a very broad sense. Extreme cases result in decade long comas, while milder cases just seem like depression. I’m somewhat paranoid that I have that to some degree.
Our paths are similar in that I’ve had good work ethic and high self esteem to varying degrees throughout my life and that I think I may have been depressed for a while now. I remember having thoughts as early as 5-6 years old about how life is too long and just wanting it to end. I can kind of separate my life into times when I was distracted from this thought and times I was acutely aware of it. Like you, I’ve never had the overwhelming urge to harm/kill myself, but I do think about doing so fairly often. Unlike you, I have gotten to the point of not being able to get out of bed or shower etc. Another interesting difference is that your feelings seem to be caused by too much stress, while I believe mine are caused by a lack of stress. I’m also in 2nd year, have been to 5-10 lectures this term and still can’t get my self to study for my midterms until the day before/of. I just don’t have that urgency I once did.
I don’t know if I’m depressed and I don’t really care. What I’ve done in place of external help is to try like hell to get on track when I do get some motivation. For a while I stopped all drugs (aside from caffeine and cold stuff; as caffeine dependance actually seems to make me feel better and I can’t really discern the effects of cold meds), started exercising and made something I was interested in. I was more or less on track then, but at some point hopelessness replaced the motivation and here we are. I bet seeing a doctor couldn’t hurt, so long as you stress that you have no urge to / worry that you will self-harm. Friends have told me that some doctors are a little pushy with meds, so be aware of that.

"
"&gt; Thankfully there is a culture shift happening where mental health is being destigmatized and can be more freely talked about, which improves outcomes for all.

This is true, to a point.  Sometimes I feel the opennes around mental health is watering down issues of serious mental health, like the boi who is cutting open his arms to get my attention, and the poor gnetleman last year who took his life at the MSA, and the every day common stressors that affect all people in their daily life.

That is to say, ""mental health"" should not and cannot be a 'catch all' for 'im stressed and dont know what to do', which is so common among students, given it's their first kick at life, and a more realist approach to problem solving.

you will hear me disparage cops and government and CECA many times on this sub, the reason is not simply to be rebellious nor stir aimless shit; it is rather to draw attention to the reality than in the day to day course of REAL LIVING, there is nobody who will swoop in and solve your problems, according to established rules, or agreed convention.  Reality is, we all need to solve our daily personal problems ourselves, for the most part, despite that help is sometimes availalable - and to encourage the idea that ""OH!  I feel a bit of anxiety regarding something!!! Better call my externally provided babysitter to solve my problems!!!"" is neither realistic nor helpful - despite my trivializing the problem here with this statement.
  You get my point, I'm sure.

&gt; I don't understand why you find it unbelievable that someone would seek help if their mental health is declining or if they're in distress.

I encourage anyone to seek help when they notice delcining mental health, however, I think my point is something more along the lines of severity: people who have the wherewithall to incdicate themselves among tthe group who could benefit from help, are not suicidal.  Generally.  Given that resources for mental health are so limited, and that everyone has vastly different ideas of what constitutes need for mental health (some guys think exam stress is a mental health issue, some girls think the boy who slept with her last weekend is a mental health issue, some other guy is planning to kill himself tomorrow and thinks everyone is bullshit ans says nothing at all)  

&gt; But that type of thinking does not come out of nowhere instantly

i agree that it does not come from nowhere (pardon the double negative) but my original observation, it is not public.  If it were detectable in any easy metric, we would not be having this conversation.  for those who are serious about suicide, ie. the cases where it actually happens, there are very little preindicators unless you include addiction or other sociodemographics like sexual orientation.

&gt; You sound jaded 

Well, I can't influence the way you perceive me, but I can assert that I am not jaded.  my approach and opinion is a real one, based in reality, not idealism.  It could be that to hear an opinion rooted in these ways is so jarring for you that it sounds 'jaded', ah could be.  I live and work in human places much more difficult than you may find in KW, or China, or Western Europe, ahhhh if you're from India you might be getting closer... my point is, There is a human reality my dear, and sometimes depression or whatever the cause of suicide may happen to be, works faster than our ability to detect or ever understand it.  Doesn't make me jaded to acknowledge that fact.

&gt; There is no one-size-fits-all model or experience of mental illness.

You're correct.

&gt; Don't mock others struggles because they don't mirror yours or you've maybe had it worse.

Again, I am not mocking anyone, I am merely being blunt and adding what I consider ""reality"" to the discussion.  Society simply doesn't have the resources to hold hands of everyone who claims a ""mental health issue"", despite that these days, with,as you mention, destigmatization, every little concern is now an open public debate.

Plumt, you sound like a caring and conscientious individual.  I will share a little bit about myself in these few moments before we sign off.  While I was waiting for the electricity to come back on, I asked a man hauling a cart down a road in front of my apartment, whether he could spare $1.14 worth of candies and treats for kids who were, not exactly begging me, but who had never really seen a white man before.

"Super easy in comparison.  Just the sheer amount of material that comes later on makes my 1st year undergrad look like nothing.

No regrets though.  Just don't skip classes and have a study routine.  Material difficulty depends on your subject.  Seek help in office hours, as needed.  Rely on friends (make sure to make friends who study the same stuff as you, that's crucial)."

"I've been holding office hours in the MathSoc office (as an office manager). MathSoc execs have to hold at least 3 office hours every week; I hold 5.5 hours!

During these hours, I talk to our office volunteers (almost always 1st or 2nd year students, sometimes 3rd or 4th years!) and ask them if they have any complaints or suggestions that I should bring up to MathSoc, the Faculty and Feds. 

If some people come in to my office hours and complain/suggest things for MathSoc or the Faculty, I immediately bring it up to my exec team and contact anyone who should be aware of the complaint/suggestion so it can be resolved quickly."
"What school you go to btw?


I went to Western Canada HS in Calgary and currently first year computer eng at Waterloo, so it wasn't too long ago that I was applying. I applied to early admission, because I was in partial IB and had finished Math 30, 31 and physics 30 in grade 11. My early admission average was 93, and that's the average that I got admitted on.


At the start of the grade 12 I signed up for a bunch of volunteer tutoring, and basically used that to pad my AIF. Besides that I had a part time job but that was it.


You should sign up for the Euclid and Canadian Computing Competition.


Also, Alberta education is not as hard as you make it seem, I had lots of friends at Western who had low 90's, an active social life, and did sports/ec's. And Western definitely does not inflate grades. Just get good at managing your time, and being disciplined in following through."
"Sure but the overall level of opportunity in terms of just postings per program is extremely skewed in favour of the aforementioned programs. So many ww roles are technical and are handfed to them as opposed to the slim pickings for decent jobs that usually dont even decent pay for the other faculties. (Inb4 ""WeLl thAts becAusE sTEm is tHe MoSt RelEvaNt AnD sO it PayS beTTeR"") 

But for the most part what i was getting as was the fact that UW advertises its coop reputability as if its tossing out solid jobs across all faculties, but its clear the school only really gives a fuck about providing solid tech roles only really achievable by math eng and cs students and simply toss shitty government jobs and lowly research roles to everyone else. Its a sham to students in the other faculties when Ceca and UW jebait them hard like they do with the sTEM majors but then only really focus on providing that experience to sTEM.

Tldr: math eng and cs are the only faculties/depts that are given high quality opportunities that are seemingly advertised acroas the board in UW coop promotion to incoming students for all faculties. Big bamboozle"
"&gt; He runs a bunch of pretty popular fitness programs and has hundreds of thousands of followers on youtube/instagram. 

THat could be very well true, in fact i have no reason to doubt it.  But, consider that the world is full of people who vote for trump and christian evangelists... Surely they get millions of cvotes too right?

&gt; What do you think is unattractive about his body?

Well, let's not say ""unattractive"".  Of course his body looks great.  But, it's not a form of reality.  It's lighting and technique, first of all.  But ignoring that, it's not really what girls want.  I assume this post is about finding girls, for you?  Maybe I'm wrong, idk.  But as much as media wants to sell you the idea that a ""pefect"" male physique is what girls or boys want when it comes to sex, it's not really true.  

I'm sure if you search ""river phoeix shirtless"" you'll see something close to me, but, that's not even the point.  I don't want to speak on behalf of women, there are some here, somewhere, they can speak up themselves.  But for men it's the same, a person is much more than their picture, and maybe you are confusing tinder/grindr/online everything for real life.  People are always more attractive irl.

Small_peepee, my advice to you is, in addition to working out or whatever makes you feel cool about your body, is meet girls in random situations and be comfortable with yourself, sufficiently to explain, if she asks, why you're cool.  

girl&gt; ""What are you up to tonight, small_peepee?""
small_peepee&gt; ""I Don't know, really, but I hope you can be a part of it?""

2. Read books that you want to read. I dont get what youre asking.

If you want to learn a great variety of subjects, look up books and start reading them. You literally will not make use of 99% of books at the library so im not sure what you are expecting. "
"I lived in V2 in 1983 - East A Animals was my floor.  I think  V2 is called Ron something or other now.  There was a parking lot between it and V1, which now has a residence in it.

I worked at Fed Hall in its opening year (85 going off memory).  It was not yet built at the time of these photos.  I wish you current students could all have experienced Fed Hall in its heyday  It was jammed Thurs - Sat night  and at least somewhat busy every night - a huge 2 story video screen would come down and live dj's did the music - at the time Fed Hall had the best sound system anywhere - a very expensive setup that cost I think over 100K even then.  Literally there would be at least a few hundred people on the dance floor - I think we were licensed for 1500 or more capacity and it was always jam packed with a lineup.  The 80's with dance and electronic music were the heyday and I feel for you all that you don't get to experience that part of the socialization experience at university.  A couple of thousand students partying every night on weekends was a great way to blow off steam, in a controlled environment.  It really was fantastic.  And the food was good at the time - the Fed Hall manager (my memory says ""Chuck"") ran a pretty good kitchen.  Lots of people both staff and students would go there for lunch and dinner - during the day it was a restaurant and at night a 2 floor party palace.

The best thing about Fed Hall was that it taught socialization skills - engineers, math and physics students partying side by side with rec and arts students.  It really helped everyone get along.  And I am sure it helped with stress as well.

Math only had one main building.  It was all mainframe computing then - we used to line up at 3am on a Fri night to get a pascal terminal.  Hundreds of terminals (in fact I think thousands) but there was always a lineup as computing time was cheaper late at night - we had a ""budget"" assigned to us individually for each course and you could not exceed it - computing time was discounted heavily after 11pm or something like that.  All the math lecture halls were in a ring around the core where the terminal rooms and mainframes were located.

E3 for Env did not exist.  Nor did most of the engineering buildings up by phillip st.

The only thing on the north campus where the optometry building is located was Optometry.  Closer to Columbia lake there were sports fields.  Otherwise it was just fields, not a building in sight or those townhouse residences!   We used to walk in groups through the fields to get to the neighbourhoods on the other side of north campus (Albert/Phillip and all those burbs).  It was a barren cold walk in the winter.  There was not a single building on Phillip St north of Columbia drive that I recall.

There were no timmies, no starbucks, no cafes on campus anywhere.  No store in the campus centre either.

The bible colleges were tiny, and I don't believe in all my time I ever met a single student from any of them although I think they were mostly arts oriented.  I know St Paul's now no longer even has a religious affiliation being oriented towards Env, women in engineering and science, and aboriginal programs plus apparently has the best residence and food.

My sad regret is I don't think I have a single picture from back then.  I doubt most of us do.  No cellphones or easy way of taking pictures.  Enjoy it while you can.  Make some memories.

"You don't believe it, but it does happen. It has happened to my friends. It has happened to me.

She did not want that to happen and felt that her bodily autonomy had been violated. Is that as harmful as rape? No of course not. Is it still unethical and harassment? Yes. How would you like it if someone just randomly grabbed you in that way? 

The problem is that sexual assualt is usually perpetrated by those close to the victim as in the case above - it was a mutual friend. What is your definition of ""sexual undertones?"" That situation above had sexual undertones but just because a situation has sexual undertones doesn't mean you still need to ensure enthusiastic consent from whoever you intend to touch. "

"The guy who's a tiny bit less attractive than you probably wishes he was a bit more attractive and thinks it would make his life much easier.

And the guy who's a tiny bit more attractive than you probably wishes a tiny bit more would make his life much easier too.

There are certain things you can do to help with attractiveness but at the end of the day you have to accept the cards you were dealt.

Also, keep in mind that while life generally isn't fair, different people often have different strengths. For example, I'd say I'm a 7-8/10 on looks, 3/10 height, 8-9/10 intelligence, 2-3/10 patience/resilience, 1-2/10 mental health, 5/10 work ethic...etc. Where would that take me? Who knows. How will those attributes change? Who knows. I see my life as a unique journey and you should too. It does suck to see people better than us in certain aspects but you shouldn't get hung up on it."
"**Boiling frog**

The boiling frog is a fable describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.

While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out.

"I'm hopeful that it will over time replace the organized crime-run black market, and that it will also avoid the significant harm criminalization caused marginalized populations.

The way the new Ontario government is approaching legalization, however, has problems. The province has said that communities that don't opt out lose all ability to plan where these stores may be sited, with the AGCO responsible instead. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario suggested amendments to the legislation to at least restrict locations to commercial/retail areas, but the government rejected those changes. I'm concerned about this loss of local authority and what it means for how we plan our community. 

At the same time, the province has said any municipality that opts out won't get more than $10,000 in revenue sharing to deal with the increased costs of enforcement. 

So I'll be looking for how the regulations are drafted and whether the AGCO permitting process will give substantial weight to municipal input before deciding whether opting out for now is better than losing the revenue-sharing that can mitigate the costs we'll have anyways."
"While I appreciate your enthusiasm for voting, I don't think the city has any stake in most of the housing complaints around here.  City likely cares more about how the buildings affect their neighbours, and comply with bylaws. 

Slow internet, crappy housing, water off, key deposits, overcharging for room repairs - all that stuff is provincial LTB stuff that the city has no effective ability to impact.  

For example, here's the response from Karen Redman with a political pablum answer.  Notice how two paragraphs say absolutely nothing in particular:

\&gt;Students  form an important part of our community and our future - we have three  excellent educational institutions that bring them here, and we always  hope they choose to stay (as many already have), and become part of that  “permanent population” to which you refer.

A  safe and well-maintained supply of rental housing is key to making that  case, so it is absolutely essential that we all support the efforts of  our municipal property standards personnel. If you have a specific  concern, I urge you to contact your local municipality (city or  township) and make a report."

One student was dead set on replacing the entire animation library we had developed that worked swimmingly on mobile with some god awful SVG one (SMIL).  Note this was 2016.  By the end of 2015 this SVG Animation thing was pretty much dead in the water. And this UofT grad is trying to tell us that it's the hottest new thing.  We fired him 2 months later because all his 'hot shit' that he learned at UofT was about 2 to 3 years out of date.  Which was common with UofT applicants.

You could make the same arguments about many branches of science from social science to abstract physics. You aren't qualified to discredit  it. Yes, targeting microplastics as we have would be beneficial. So would continuing to properly finance all science research including climate and green strategies. If anything, letting us be kept back from innovating due to our oil interests makes us lose out on spearheading a lucrative emerging industry. Muzzling public scientists is a disservice to taxpayers who fund their research and deserve to know about it. Reducing funding to Environment Canada with a broad brush, whose studies extend far beyond just climate to space winds and aquatic ecosystems, is ridiculous partisan overreach. "
"&gt;As many children as possible

We should probably only aim for this when some sort of technological revolution makes it certain that we can handle it, otherwise aiming for an average of 2.1 to maybe 3 would probably be best. Welfare and social programs makes aging populations a huge issue because the proportion of dependents increases, and there won't be a future payoff for this because those dependents will be soon be dead. There's also the potential that an aging populations overall global power is reduced, which is problematic if your well being depends on controlling the globe or other powers are looking to expand. 

&gt;Tolerance, acceptance, promotion

You're right, I don't know exactly what distinguishes these since the line seems to be constantly moving. For instance, if tolerance means keeping my mouth shut while public finances are used to fund things I don't like then what does acceptance and promotion mean?

Perhaps not consciously, but they don't make the choice to be fertile. The things I would propose would ensure that being infertile would become a conscious choice.

"Hey guys, I'm a 2A CS Double Degree in the Laurier Co-op System so Winter 2019 will be my first co-op. I don't have any relevant work experience and a meh gpa (in the mid 70s which isn't too bad but my worst marks are in CS &amp; I'm going for only software jobs so it looks pretty bad). I have completed some side projects as well as some leadership experiences which I have outlined in my resume. After getting two interviews from medium-sized companies in the Laurier Co-op system, I haven't gotten any in the past week &amp; primary round postings have just ended. I've applied to 40 jobs in Laurier Co-op (pretty much every software job they had), and to 60+ externally (no luck). I'm getting worried because I will definitely need more than 2 interviews to have a reasonable chance of sniping a job. Any feedback on my resume will be greatly appreciated (format got messed up on Imgur, it looks like normal latex in pdf form).

"I liked NYC a lot better but it really depends on you. Off the top of my head,

* Culture is way better in NYC. I found the generic tech bro and whole vibe in the bay area insufferable. NYC on the other hand, tech is just one of many wealthy markets, the professional diversity there is great. And gender diversity (Man Jose anyone?)
* Since you're going in the winter SF has a big advantage in weather. The cold is only slightly better in NYC than it is here, but you'll be at worst in hoodie weather in SF during the winter term
* Don't know enough about housing, hopefully you get corporate housing to make things easier. They're similarly priced afaik though.
* Easily more things to do and see in the NYC area. You could spend 4 months there doing new things every weekend and not even scratch the surface.
* If you like tech meetups, I've found NYC is not like SF but it's still really good. If you're looking for meetups in *literally anything else* NYC is better.
* Food is probably a tossup, although In-N-Out &gt; Shake Shack.
* NYC public transit is dirty but it's damn efficient. You can get around so easily with just the subways.
* Access to other cities is much better in NYC. Easy to make trips to Philly, Boston, Baltimore/DC. SF you've got LA.
* I'll also add that SF itself is disgusting, and makes NYC seem clean in comparison. The amount of sharps and human waste on the sidewalks is disgusting, and the homeless population is a lot more aggressive. Hyper progressive policy in that area has done a lot of damage and it isn't getting better any time soon.

So I think it's mostly up to you and your preferences. East coast all the way for me."

No I'm an international actually so the concept of first/upper year is alien to me. Can you please explain me what does it mean?
No they don’t. If you’re a piece of shit you don’t deserve respect and shouldn’t be surprised if people are mean to you

So, like if you have a racial based fetish, like that by itself isn't anything problematic. It's only when you act on it (which is like, the behavior I'm trying to call out in my other comments) that it is a problem cuz you're involving other people in your fetish that didn't consent to being in it. "
"I'm saying that context matters, and that a broad definition of sexual assault would mean that it would mostly be by people who are closer to you and/or in a context which has sexual undertones. I don't believe that people going around groping people they barely know is at all a common occurrence. That's why I think it's a lot more complicated than the media would have us believe. "
If you’re anxious about spending money then just don’t spend it. Spending more money won’t help you be happier in that regard. With that said there’s no reason you can’t spend more now that you’re making more money and are better off. That’s like saying we should never treat diseases once we find a cure because patients that came before and died didn’t have access. 
"Wow, you've got it all figured out, don't you?

I just find it rude how, after inviting me to interview with them, they suddenly no longer respond to me. I don't find it unfathomable, I get why a company would do that, they don't owe me anything. That doesn't mean I can't be upset about it though, like jesus c'mon man. It's a fucking let down after you get your hopes up like that.

"Yeah man instead of a lighter they give you an offer. If you gas the offer and try to get it again/do some weird shit to snake the employer, then the employer's Stando CECA Blyat attacks you with the arrow.

"He probably has my support. I'm a bit concerned about splitting the vote, but Harper conservatism does nothing but slowly give ground to the progressives. 

Bernier's best bet is to play regional politics, which he doesn't seem to want to do, because his best chance is probably in the prairies and outside of cities. 

Unfortunately, Bernier is going to give the big three all the more reason not to follow through with electoral reform. The libs and cons prefer having a good shot at majority governments, and the ndp wouldn't want to give a voice to anyone right of Trudeau. Although the libs and ndp would probably love ranked votes...."
"Objectively speaking, a part of it comes down to genetics. Women are naturally more empathetic while men tend to provide solutions. Unfortunately, that's just the way we instinctively behave ignoring the anomalies.

Have you tried telling anyone around you that you just need a listening ear, someone to rant to, not someone who thinks they can just magically solve your problems? No one can read minds, no one is going to know what exactly it is what you want unless you tell them. I feel like half of the time a girls talks about a problem, it's not even a problem, just that she needs someone to rant to and tell her it's going to be ok."
"Of course it does. Somehow as we get bigger, public sector services get more expensive per capita every year. There's little recourse for an ever increasing cost. No real accountability. At least in private sector, people can go elsewhere for your services/you can go bankrupt. You could argue that there are private universities, but unfortunately publicly funded universities make up such a large portion of the post-secondary education market in Canada, that they effectively set the floor for salaries and tuition costs. Is publicly funded education bad? By no means. Is almost no budgetary accountability? Yes. Hard to balance the two."
"Yes me and my roommates have tried to.  There was water leaking into our electric control panel and our power was on and off for almost a month.  We filed an application to the LTB and a few weeks later kw4rent was notified of the trial and reached out to us.  We eventually settled in private.

If I remember correctly they were suppose to do a move out inspection with you and you were supposed to sign a paper saying your room is clean and you have handed your keys back.  That being said you can try sue them.  Like you said the application fee is only $45 and if you win the court usually makes the other side pay for it.

"Not an IP lawyer, but if they have a deal with Argonne (pretty well-known research lab) specifying that:

- UW *owns* the IP

- Argonne has *exclusive* licensing rights

then is it too far fetched to imagine that there is a protection clause for Argonne that explicitly requires UW to protect the exclusivity of Argonne over the intellectual property or be liable for incurred damage/lost commercialization opportunities etc. ?

It makes perfect sense because otherwise UW (or any University in that position) could simply accept the funding, promise exclusive licensing rights and then never enforce it... or leave it to the party providing funding (while retaining nominal ownership of the IP...) which is not a deal I imagine anyone would take. 

For all its flaws, UW has been pretty forward-thinking on IP issues and that reaction feels out of character for it to not have another dimension."
"So I know Transit is more of a regional thing, but is there any stress City Council can put on the regional chair or other regional councillors to try to get busing access to our Stratford campus (where GBDA is). I ask because this is perpetually an issue as the Uni invests more in satellite campuses, and students tend to be shit-out-of-luck in terms of busing with some exceptions.

The Uni runs a partial semi-periodic bus service to Stratford campus, but it's not accessible to all and isn't frequent (how the picture has been painted by Stratford/GBDA students whose courses are split over both campuses at Students' Council). 

Escalating this as an important _city_ matter with the region would really help a lot and pressure change! Now obviously there's an inter-regional component of this, but I'd still like it if you could touch on what you could do to help address this if possible."
"i think OP is looking for interviews solely to have realistic human interactions and not the technical problem solving questions.

usually the technical questions are either you know it or you dont. if you know it, it is rarely an issue to have difficulties presenting your findings and thus, it’s easy to do even without much practice.

behavioural questions are a lot more ambiguous and there really isnt a clear right answer. furthermore, it may sometimes be hard to prepare for some of the questions that may be asked, so OP really needs to practice her improv skills and thinking quickly.

CECA can help you with this. it’s also good to get the jitters out before the actual interview.

i bombed interviews multiple times as well. and i had retrospectives of do’s and don’ts which significantly helped my interview skills.

interviews really comes down to practice and experience imo"
"&gt; There should be cool, creepy clubs that you can join.

Literally every club.

&gt; Your dream crush should sit right beside you and drop their pencil or eraser at least twice a week.

&gt; Your childhood friend should sit on the other side and glare daggers when this happens.

Yours don't?

&gt; Anyone important to anything should have the last seat in the row beside the window.

What window?

&gt; All the cool people and/or rebels/misfits should sit around on the roof between classes, gazing off towards the horizon.

Fastest way to get expelled.

&gt; Every path leading away from the school needs a rail crossing, so that a train can pass during tense or dramatic moments.

There is a train track to the east. The west side doesn't matter.

&gt; A mysterious transfer student should join every class at least once a month.

A bunch joins every term though.

&gt; Huge, international celebrities should be seeded throughout the student body, yet be unrecognizable due to wearing glasses and/or a hat.

I mean, they all look the same.

&gt; In fourth year, it should be revealed that the school is actually a magic/mecha/demonic/psychic/angel/ghost training institute.

You learn this in orientation.

&gt; Is it too much to ask for a maid cafe? Or a cat cafe? Or even just a chill cafe where you're always the only one there, besides the cute and/or hunky staff?

Hmm... this happens once a term."

Determining which students to accept into Conestoga College is always a difficult decision and is based on many factors. I regret to inform you that you were not selected this year. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to accept every student who makes an application.

I would suggest contacting the University of Toronto as they have much easier admission requirements. I wish you the best of luck.

"Saying something is more common then you think isn't implying that statistically they're in the majority. I also didn't realize I needed to source all my comments on reddit.

But an obvious example is the man that ran over a bunch of people in Toronto that was involuntarily celibate.

It's hard to accurately estimate the percentage of people that think like that since many aren't outspoken, etc. But in my opinion there's a surprising amount of incel communities on reddit and facebook, at least more than I thought. And many of them have been shut down. 

But I mean ultimately, something being more common than I thought is subjective. "
"&gt; But i mean 1st year physics in ECE is basically the same as 1st year physics as a physics student (just ECE is harder).

How would you know? When comparing with my Math Phys friends, they seemed to be a step under in difficulty, because we needed to cover everything in one shot. I talked to one of my profs who's a PHD in physics and she agreed it's a bit crammed.

&gt;  ECE doesn't really depend on upper year physics, but if you have an elective (idk eng schedule) then i guess they can learn more phys.

Our first elective is in 3B afaik. And shockingly, waves and SHM comes back, not that you'd know a lot about ECE

If you really want to compare
ECE 105:
&gt; **Forces in nature and Newton's laws, Dynamics and circular motion, Work, Energy and conservation of energy. Linear Momentum and linear Impulse, Rotational Dynamics. Oscillations; Simple Harmonic Motion. Wave motion; Traveling waves and standing waves. Thermal Physics; Temperature, Thermal energy and Specific heat**, Ideal gas heat engines and Refrigerators. [Offered: F]

Phys 121: 
&gt; An introductory course in physics for students intending to concentrate their future studies in the physical sciences, optometry or mathematics; **includes particle kinematics and dynamics, forces in nature, work and energy, conservation of energy and linear momentum, rotational kinematics and dynamics, and conservation of angular momentum.**

"I recommend looking up the podcast ""The Art of Charm"". The part about being a high-value person is seriously indispensable. 

I used to have ridiculously poor social skills until second year, so here's my biggest advice from someone who wasn't born socially competent: **Don't talk to people for the explicit purpose of feeling good.**

It's painfully obvious when someone's doing something because they're fishing for validation/attention/feeling included. Your interactions should be driven by mutually beneficial means instead. For example, talking to someone to *share* ideas rather than for them to just listen to yours. When having a normal conversation, don't brag or put other people down - in the moment people are polite, but they'll associate you with negativity from that point forward.

In general, when doing social stuff, it has to be for the purpose of providing smth ""useful"" to other people. Luckily the bare minimum you can do is pay attention to what people say and acknowledge the things they've said. You don't even need to give advice or add something intelligent - just demonstrating that you're processing their words, and maybe that you want to know more, is all you really need to make connections.

When you mention 'social skills' you are maybe talking about smth really broad like public speaking, but at least for one-on-one conversation this above stuff should do u really well"
"??? You'll be able to see what they rank you. So if they both rank you ""1"" you decide which to go for by not ranking both as ""1"". "
All of his videos are so great. It's actually incredible how he manages to make a normal situation into something so unbelievable.

"I talk about myself if they ask. I find that sometimes they talk more, other times, I talk more. It depends how reserved they are."
"I would want to do that but I’m way too scared.. they seem really aggressive.

Do you put your hand out first for them to smell?"
"I'd recommend Dr Theresa Chow on Regina St, she really helped me out. Wait times are loooong though (but I guess that's everyone)."
"Idk I find SLC too noisy - even when it's past midnight.

"It's isn't priced on distance, it's priced on minutes, looks like you took about 14 mins to travel that far, which is kinda fair. "
It's like a good joke that's been repeated over and over. I've seen those same images so many times that they've lost their charm.
Nailed it. OP needs new friends... or literally even just one good one to talk to and listen to. Makes a world of a difference....
Ok thanks! I just assumed that was a delayed message since we didn’t get one when interviews were sent out so I just ignored it.

"Wait really? I've always worked 9-5, including the 1hr lunch. Isn't that why it's called a 9-5, cause you're not there for longer?"
Well I visit the office pretty often and theres people working fridays at like 8pm and on weekends. But I'm sure it varies by team

You could talk to a prof that's doing research in the same field as what you want to do. There are 4th year courses made for this.

"Came here to say this. /u/OHlookABoard nailed it.

They are salaried for 37.5hr/week but in reality, put in around 60 hr/week on committees, University meetings, advocacy work, staffing work, internal meetings (Board and Council), lobbying meetings with MPs/MPPs and City Councillors, etc... 

Communicating what happens is tough, but they do put in a lot of work on behalf of students."
"I agree Tbh. I've volunteered with international students and currently do and they're very kind. Sure their may be some rude ones out there, but I guess I'm more understanding of why they act in certain ways. Just yesterday one of the volunteers in the past I worked with gave me free bubble tea and remembered my name and told me I was her friend:*(((( Like I literally almost cried. "
"That was me this morning. I saw a bunch of names on your screenshot and I thought it was in violation of the PI rule. I was on my phone and I didn't really understand the context, so I just deleted it. I realize now that the name is the prof's and the link in your picture is something public that can be seen by anyone, even if they are not in the class.

I fucked up there - my bad.

"
"That's true. But I've heard that after your 1st or 3rd co-op/job, it all boils down to experience, side projects, and interview skills, and the education part becomes less and less relevant. Is that true?

But I see what you mean too. Even if I do get into Waterloo, maintaining those scholarships is something that I definitely need to take into account if I wanna pay down my tuition."
"tbh your uni experience is what you make it.

especially if you're living off campus, you don't have res events and easy access to other people to rely on.

don't blame the university for not getting you laid or not being fun enough. go out and make your own fun.

also don't buy into the whole ""best time of our lives"" garbage. if you peak in university, it's all downhill from there. "
"Because nothing will ever get better if people don’t try to change things. I agree that anarchy wouldn’t happen either way (probably) I was just illustrating how much daily impact regional decisions have on your life. 

My one big push is that you’d be helping future generations by breaking free from the current, out of touch admin. I’m forward thinking, I care about climate change and innovation and I think it’s a net benefit to the community to challenge the status quo.

"Grade 10 marks don't matter. Grade 11 marks matter very little, from what I know.

UW CS coop is not only very competitive, but it's a difficult program. If you don't have at least mid 90s average with good extracurriculars, don't expect to get in. Even if you do, still don't expect to get in but you'd at least have a chance. Do the Euclid and CCC, make sure you score highly.

If you're struggling to maintain a 90s average in high school, you'll barely last a month here unless you make a tremendous change. Understand that most students in CS had monster high school averages, but the course averages are still usually in the 60s or 70s."
"Great.

I also see king street revitalization is part of your platform which is odd given the amount of work and money that has been poured into it recently. What about bike lanes or traffic calming on Erb and Bridgeport to make it easier for cyclists and pedestrians using those streets or crossing on the Laurel trail or near Moore/Laurel with kids on the way to Emmanuel or EZ? These are issues that affect Mary Allen and Uptown North but are largely ignored by representatives who typically live on the other side of King. AFAIK the city has suggested moving the light at Peppler, but that just strands the people who cross there instead."
"It's quite funny that they say it's not cool, funny or hero-worthy to over commit to studying. As if people were sacrificing their mental health and social life to be cool and funny.

The educational system in STEM is badly adjusted to the reality of both research and work. You're getting evaluated on how much you can learn and spit out under pressure. There needs to be more weight on involved projects that you can manage a schedule for, spread over the whole term. As far as I know, it's closer to that model in social science. The best students still come out on top regardless, and I'm sure less people would have mental health issues."
"Like I said, I didn't downvote you, I was just explaining why I thought you were probably downvoted.

I just searched ""what does a quant do"" and, as usual, [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst) came up with a very clear and in-depth answer.  Here are the first couple sentences:

&gt; A quantitative analyst (or, in financial jargon, a quant) is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems. The occupation is similar to those in industrial mathematics in other industries."
"Very true.

 Thinking about it, the entire league seemed to be very even this year (with the exception of Western, of course). Close games everywhere,  with a lot of the traditional powerhouse teams (Laurierr,  McMaster, Guelph, Queen’s) seeming to go into rebuilding mode, or have an off year, all at the same time.    It made things really entertaining, honestly.

Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that the last time UW made it to (and won) provincials, they had a 4-4 record.   Doubtful they’ll go far with this playoff run (probably semi finals at most), but you never know… They have a chance...  it’s happened before..."
"hah.

You'd have to be dumb to not realize that psilocybin is not something that a government ever wants legalized. 

Marijuana can make the population complacent, lazy consumers. That's good for capitalist democracy.

Waking people up to the divinity within nature, giving them the experience of ego death, and curing their dependence to various substances and behaviors is *not* something which benefits your corporate rulers.

For someone who claims to be so woke about big pharma and the war on drugs, you really don't seem to ""get it"". 

""They"" legalized marijuana because it benefits ""them"". Not you. Go on and enjoy your grass, monkey."
"oh wow when they came to my school in 2017 they told me they had it. Shitty its gone now.

I honestly don't think I am over hyping anything. It was a study based off of 12,000 students. Also, it is not like the differential is 2%... it's 13.2%, which in my opinion can DEFINITELY be the difference between a 93% in Alberta, and a 95+ student elsewhere. It's a fact so I don't see any hype =). It also hurts the chances of getting admitted to a competitive university.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some insight... let me compare a few school for instance. Robert Thirsk, you get unlimited test rewrites, or 3 cant remember what it was. Some schools also allow you to replace quiz marks, with unit tests. Where as Churchill is a different beast, you don't get any rewrites, and they're very heavy and strict about everything. Even within the school, teachers matter as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Also some schools, if you're from Calgary (NE), have to lower the bar because many students are not well off, and its the only way they can maintain a decent graduation rate. It depends which high school and I don't think it's ""just high school"" until you are in uni. "

I think you just need to learn how to appreciate what's good about you instead of just focusing on the things you're unhappy with. 
I was receiving ranking for almost every single exam and test I took for 11 years and that was one important reason I hated school 
I would think that it depends on the contract. Either way you can always ask - and probably won't be able to do much if they say no
"I'd love to join you at some bar or something, but I'm not I'm Waterloo :(

"For what it's worth, you shouldn't put that much stock into the MacLean's rankings - I (and many other people I know who went to Mount A) are convinced Mount Allison is either paying off MacLeans, or someone in charge of the rankings is a Mount A alumnus. Mount A is a good school (especially if you're an arts student), but it's definitely not the #1 undergraduate university in Canada."
"I find it tricky sometimes because I also happen to ask a few questions during the interview when the interviewer says something that I want to know more about.

"It's still fairly experimental (early days yet) so the workload may vary. Key thing to know is that there is a fair bit of group work. Not sure where you get that UW is notorious for work, but expect to spend some time on the weekends filming things.

Also Greyhound sometimes overbooks so be sure to be there early to get a seat. "
"How is a student's house and his bedsheet part of the WLU organization? If he's a student and WLU wants to punish him, they can't invoke the regional police to do so. 

Why would the regional police enforce WLU regulations or their internal HR disputes? They enforce the law. So, supposedly the law is that you can't say upsetting things to people.

I'd understand if it were a by-law, KW has some stupid by-laws. But the police don't typically get involved there unless they really need to. Some by-law enforcement officer affiliated with the city just comes to your house and writes you a notice or a ticket. Trust me, I would know... sigh. "
"This is probably owing to their terrible product-market-fit for their day to day operations.

They're at a school where students are busy AF - yet they offer slow service, a kitchen that often gets orders wrong, and it takes forever to flag someone down to pay.

So... they should implement mobile ordering for pickup to avoid having to call 5 times until someone picks up, deliver to on campus buildings, and a simplified late night menu they can offer for students still studying on campus &gt;&gt; i'd kill for a ceasar wrap with hashtag fries at 9PM in DC.

"Use the textbook or course notes. Skim everything except the examples and try to do those on your own. They should have detailed step by step instructions for them. Then do some practice problems from the back if they have answers

Usually, there's only a few types of problems that can be asked. Maybe only a dozen types of questions. You can write down the basic steps for each of these. There will also be some theory and proof questions. Most of the marks are in just solving problems so worry about these after.

In any math class I've done here, at least half the marks you can get just by memorizing a few steps to all the problem types"

"&gt;I wasn't spefically talking about you

I imagine that since I'm fairly unremarkable, my exprience is shared with many others.

&gt;I just meant in general it's a waste of time to think about, it's interesting, but it's not helpful. It could even end up making someone feel worse.

I agree. However, I like to think of myself as a rational person and therefore I often try to think of reasons for things to be the case.

Why don't people like me? Largely because I have poor social skills. Why do I have poor social skills? Because bullying and exclusion retarded my development of those. Why was I bullied or excluded? I'll never know for sure but I do know that (a) I am ugly, and (b) ugly people tend to be bullied and excluded more. Why do ugly people get bullied more? Because our species values physical appearance so highly.

Of course this train of thought makes me feel worse, but I have plenty of time to think about it since I spend so little of my time with friends.

&gt;Why do you think that you were bullied because you were ugly though and not something else?

I don't know if I was bullied specifically because I was ugly. As in, folks didn't call me ugly (to my face at least). I am, however, an ugly person who has been bullied. And like I said, ugly people tend to be bullied more.

Bullying wasn't actually a huge problem for me past middle school, the main thing was exclusion. For example, when the teacher says ""form groups"" and you just sit there because you know no one is gonna want to be in a group with you. You think about asking the few people who you're slightly close to but of course they're already working with their ""real"" friends.

This kind of thing continues to be an occurrence today, when people who I thought might be friends often exclude me from working together or just hanging out. BTW this includes people who said they care about me, but actions speak louder than words. "

"I think it somewhat varies, historically it's been said to be 2A because of the difficulty of the courses as well as the extreme hours. 

*However*, two things are different for us. We had the new-and-improved 1B term with 140 being moved in, 108 being a mess, just to add to the already challenging 124 and 106. We also have a slightly better 2A term (from what I've heard) that isn't as time-demanding as previous cohorts had to go through. 

Personally I found 1B to be a lot harder. There isn't a single course that I'm completely lost in at the moment in 2A, which is sorta nice I guess. Maybe it's also because 1B was in the winter term. "

Most of this I understand is my fault, as I stopped reaching out to them.  


It's only after I've started uni, that I've been able to make a select few good friends with whom I've been able to make a strong connection with, but who knows what the future holds. I think u/TheRealArjun kinda summed up my point pretty well.

* Hobbies: 500 rolling (Mostly includes things that keep their resale value), but I haven't really had time to buy anything lately or even go outside to enjoy my hobbies so this has all been shoved into index funds until a later date

I have had sex with more than 30 males, of course all of them variously gay, and gay people are more obsessed with the male physique than anyone else.

h but, I have had sex with about 12 women too, and I have no interest in women at all, which means there is something about my body or face or presence that they like, so I want to say you can't minimize it to something so simple as a pic of this dude.

And honestly very few dudes look like that anyway and tbh I don't think he's very attractive.  

ahhh i guess you're looking for pics.  i was a professional model and my pics were used and are still used in marketing, but not guys like that.  

River Phoenix is a good example of the perfect male, for white guys.  There is another guy, Japanese, Satoshi Toda, who is also perfect.  If you're simply talking about aesthetics.

But honestly OP, why did you choose this dude for a pic?  He doesn't get any action. Well, maybe he does, but, not professional action.  Nobody pays money for him to look that way.  There are a million dudes who look like that.  

When I worked as a gogo dancer it was much more important to have a kind of natural looking body, slim, low body fat, but not necessarily muscular.  so Asians do reallly well in this regard.  I don't  know why women like me, I honestly don't, I never pretended to like girls and I never tried, but, maybe there is something in my body that women like?  If that's what you're looking for maybe we can PM.  My portfolio matches google images strongly .  whatever.

"&gt; school isn't always the 'cause' for depression. ""hey im depressed""

You know, I was about to move on from this question, and ignore you as a.. hwatever you are.]

But there is something more valuable about your comment here, and it deserves revisiting.

You're right, school is not always the cause.  I am going to make an hypothesis about ""the cause"".

People, students, you, me, had some idea of ""purpose"" for life, like a kind of ""predestination"", and our degree and UW got wrapped up in that.  ""I need this job, to prove to (parents/self) that I am worthwhile,""  A kind of really expensive tinder validation.  Sad.

At some point, because it is so completely illogical, reality creeps up on most people and they realise ""there is some grievous dissonance between what I am doing with my life and what I want to do with my life"" even though the latter may be unknown.

[Listen to this for now](https://youtu.be/Aooy7iw-7cY)

The cultural background of most international students here goes undetermined by regular white folk here.  &lt;the kinds of pressure that a Chinese guy or an Indian or even middle eastern (not gulf) gets to attend here, is not comparable to what a regular white Canadian dude can understand.  I am making a big assumption here and good chance I'm wrong but i think you are an average white dude, you, criticizing me.

It's really quite ridiculous to ask a teenager to plan out his/her life, at 16 years old high school if they're Canadian, and then ask them to be happy with their choices and impose on them the inability to be wrong?

What nonesense!  No wonder people are confused and depressed.

A person, you, me, anyone, any human, needs some time to explore their reality, their context, their values, their contributions to society and their expectations in return, and that cannot be decided in an application at 16/17 years old.  To expect that, is absolutely mindless. 

So, when I say [""drop out""](https://youtu.be/LTCxINKT7l4), I mean something more ""take time to exoplore your own values.""  Does that make sense to you?

Something like [investigating reality](https://youtu.be/LIxvQMhttq4) of your own self.

"Hey dude, idk if it helps but I also sucked at lin alg and calc in my first 2 years. I love calc but I just got nervous on tests and made simple mistakes. 

Next few terms I tried to live the ActSci dream, and my high 50/low 60 average was going nowhere.

Eventually I switched into lowly statistics and found out I had enough pmath courses to get a minor on my degree too, and I haven't been happier since. I'm finishing courses with 80's and 90's now because they are much more up my alley.

The first year courses are meant to weed people out, to some extent, and you will always have profs that need to lower the class average somehow. Just try to focus on the 50% you can do, then the next 10%, etc... until you get all the building blocks down. I'll probably never get a mid-high 90 before I graduate, but getting 80's is reasonable now, which would have been absolutely insane to be 2 years ago."
"Hi /u/uwpolicy71! I'm really sorry you had such a negative experience with CECA. I actually completed my work term with them last term (so I would have been working there when this incident happened) and I just wanted to give my two cents:

1. You never should have had to go through this, it's just extra stress to our already stressful workloads
2. Thank you for sharing your story, it's always scary to take that extra chance and get your word out!

CECA is built up of **many** teams, I can guarantee that not all of CECA is bad! I won't name the team I worked on due to confidentiality, but the team I was on was really fantastic. As someone who dealt with a pituitary tumour and was diagnosed with kidney disease during my co-op term, I was truly put first. My team specifically also had 3 other co-op students and we were a priority for our supervisors. All I ask is to please don't hate on CECA as an entire entity, whoever wronged you is just a small section of it. 

If you do proceed to bring this to media, please don't take down CECA overall. Communications, Marketing, Outreach, Tech, etc teams most likely don't know any of this has happened. "

"&gt; By not debating them, they still exist, they definitely won't change their mind, and they get to think ""guess they're scared to debate me"" and other people on the fence say ""guess theyre scared to debate them"" so you definitely dont get any sort of upper hand.

People on the fence about being a neo-nazi? I mean, there's a whole spectrum, and if they're borderline neo-nazi, they've already swung pretty far right (inb4 ""but national socialist"") , since it's not exactly a moderate position. As for the anti-vax thing, I doubt people are going to take doctors saying ""your google search doesn't qualify you to have an informed opinion on the effects of vaccines, as opposed to my decade of education in biology and medicine, so I'm not going to debate you"", will suddenly make a lot of people think ""wow, those doctors with MDs in their ivory towers sure are scared of these celebrities insisting that they know vaccines cause autism, I guess they must have a point""

Are you speaking from personal experience? I can't say I've ever been pushed off the fence by people refusing to debate an extreme position, such as vaccines causing autism. 

And conversely, you certainly don't gain an upper hand by debating fringe positions, since people will think there's a halfway ground. 

That in itself isn't dangerous.

The bike lane will be in the middle of the road when you approach certain intersections, don't just stick to the side.

Learn and use turn signals when you're about to do something unpredictable.

If you ride at night, get bike lights."

I'll make sure to spend a lot more time on memorization. "

"I took it last term and \~40% proof seems about right. Most of it wasn't too bad.

"My undergrad uni had a “club” oriented restaurant and another “cafe/studious person” restaurant with good lighting such that someone just study there all day. The club was failing but the cafe turned major profits. This cafe setting is something I miss (the closest in nature here would be the Funken cafe), and while the bomber serves food very similar (in price and quantity)  to this place back home, the lighting is awful and is generally uninviting to those wishing to study. From my time here, I’ve noticed the average student to be of the more “studious” variety - perhaps a rebranding in such a direction could be considered."
"Then get rid of the restaurant and focus on the nightclub experience. Also, if people are showing up to the big events and not even being able to get in, then chances are they aren't going to want to come back on a regular night. If you want to keep your customers coming back, you have to offer a good experience on your highly promoted nights.

Edit: also on the really popular nights, charge a couple bucks more. A couple bucks more per person here or there can make a big difference. Even if less people show up, that's okay because too many people were showing up before anyways. You don't get any money from people if they don't get inside. "
"lmao. what a meme you are. those purple haired SJWs do and think as they're told. that is not where my worldview is coming from.

I don't call myself ""conservative"" dude. In Canada that means conserving what the Liberals put into place 10 years prior, so I've ditched the whole thing.

&gt; the rest of us

Yea how are ""you guys"" doing by the way? Having fun being called Nazis for your centrist views, tip-toeing around minorities and queers to one day ... I don't really know what your plan is actually. Must be fun.

Your political ideology is literally ""hey guys this SJW stuff is crazy let's slow it down for 4-8 years and then do it anyway""."
"&gt;  It completely ignores the fact that you can change someone’s life by having sex with them

I did say safe sex

&gt; It neglects the chemicals in the brain that are associated with the act.
So do lots of things, and I just mentioned something. 

If you fall in love with someone and you expect them to love you back, because you've been nice to them. It's damaging. It's not a one time thing like sex.

But again it's all irrelevant, this is about common sense and a general rule. It has nothing to do with the magnitude of the consequences.

&gt; Like I said, I agree girls need to take responsibility for what their expectations are, but the analogy does not work because it compares sex, something that is scientifically proven to have a very different effect than other tasks, with things that don’t have the same types of effects.

You just declared it is. 

&gt; It’s called being responsible with your sexual activity. Have fun safe sex all you want, but safe sex entails communication.

That's arbitrary. You defined what it means to be responsible, and you think it makes sense to expect someone else to be this definition of responsible. 

Going back to the sex example: If you agree on having sex with someone, you can only assume they want sex unless otherwise specified. More generally: if you agree with someone to do A, you can only assume they want A, you can't expect them to want B too."
"&gt; This study describes how 51% of students prefer freedom of choice in learning as opposed to unlimited choice at 28% or no choice at all at 21%.

Wouldn't removing breadth and depth requirements push us closer to ""unlimited choice"", which only 28% of students prefer?

&gt; In the study, it was discovered that the majority of students (53%) claimed that course load is the source of their stress. Elective breadth and depth requirements can be seen to be a major cause of this particular issue as it adds the course loads of 2 courses on top of the core courses that students already have to be taking.

No, it doesn't add 2 courses. You would still need to take 2 courses in their place. Unless you're talking about abolishing the 20.0 course unit requirement, but I don't see any mention of this.

&gt; One of the issues with the elective requirements, are the existence of “bird courses”.

I guarantee you that most students will continue to take these bird courses as their electives even without the breadth/depth requirements.

&gt; But what if a student is really struggling with their core courses and really can’t take on any additional course load? I believe an option to not even have to take an elective course and simply take less courses should be an option also. 

Then they should probably reconsider whether university is for them. Making university easier is not really a good solution."

Virtually everyone walked back then so its not like there was any drunk driving risk.  But it was a smart considered move by Chuck.  "
"We don’t avoid discussing this. What that study doesn’t assess is whether or not preferences are inherent (i.e. genetic) traits, or learned (i.e. behavioural). If it’s the latter, then we have a societal problem. If it’s the former, then what do? Don’t just present the numbers as though they speak for themselves. Correlation (i.e. women prefer working with people) doesn’t equal causation (i.e. women prefer working with people BECAUSE they are women).

It is completely valid to question whether or not we should just accept that “that’s the way women are”, ESPECIALLY based on the data you presented.

"1. There are people who work there and can give you information about where to find books that interest you. There are literally books on everything. Books of poems, plays, textbooks, biographies, history, treatises, philosophy books, books of essays, dissertations, theses, journals, published diaries, and much much more. Start with a topic (like ""ethics"") and work from there. If you like philosophy, ask and look around for good books on philosophy (I'm working on some philosophy too - try reading The Republic by Plato).

I'm not saying you're bad person for not sending that get well soon email, however you did miss a big opportunity to make an impact. That one person that did send an email will definitely see the benefits. Either with preferential treatment or with lenient marking. I understand these gestures might not mean much to you, but they can mean a lot to the other person. Which in turn benefits you. If you are a  Waterloo student in it's co-op program, employers are much more likely to hire and give a better review to those that go the extra mile with small pleasant gestures."
"Alum here.  I heard about the changes in the math dept from a family member in attendance at UW now.  In my time (a long time ago...) I am pretty certain that pure math, and applied math programs were the biggest programs followed by math cs.  Actuarial Math, Math Accounting, C&amp;O and Stats all had pretty close to even numbers of students but only a fraction of what was found in either Pure Math or Applied Math   Math Teaching program I only ever encountered a few people from.  The switch away from what I had always understood to be the core math programs might be why Waterloo's performance in math metrics such as Putnam and ranking systems is on the decline.

I think all math majors should have virtually identical programs in the first 2 yrs other then say 1-2 electives, and then only in 3rd yr can you specialize.  Draconian? Perhaps.  But the fundamentals would be much better reinforced."

"As others have said, I found that doing more and more practice problems (to the point where studying more almost feels like a waste of time) was the only way to reduce the number of stupid mistakes I had. The more comfortable you are with the material the easier you can identify when a step has gone wrong, and the more time you have left to re-read your work while actually writing the final."
"Co-op will be way more valuable than basically anything else if you have a specific career goal in mind.

its because you're working tirelessly on the tech stuff and not tirelessly on your charisma and physical attractiveness. Can't have everything cuz there's only a set amount of time every day. As long as ur happy with your choices then that's what matters. Seems you might benefit from putting some of the effort you spend on school on learning how to present yourself in a more attractive way. 
"Different instructors make the exams either more difficult or easier depending on their style, class performance, and how much you covered in lecture.

Of course proofs seem obvious after looking at the solutions. Doing this does not help you learn proofs in any way at all. It actually hinders you from learning how to write proofs properly. Just remember that in proofs, there is a beginning statement that you need to write (e.g. defining variables and notation), the middle portion (the actual proof), and the ending (what you actually need to prove). You need to get used to the idea that you won't get the answer instantly like in computation questions. You usually need to play around with the statement that they give you (usually with computational examples) and write down any relevant definitions and theorems that may assist you in finding the answer. Then finally deduce anything that you can from that information.

To me, proving stuff in math is like walking through a forest. You may get lost, but there is always a way out.

Knowing when to use any proof technique comes with practice. The more proofs that you write on your own, the better you get at it.

Also, the purpose of the extra practice problems not having solutions is because instructors expect that you practiced enough so that when you do those problems, you already know whether you are right or wrong after completing those questions."
"**Reputation wise.** CUHK is amongst the top three schools there (other two being HKUST and HKU). CityU and PolyU are both a tier lower but have been catching up in recent years. Current situation would be similar to comparing UofT/CUHK vs UW/CityU and OCAD/PolyU. (Before people get triggered, I'm basing this on the perspective of the schools' traditional academic rankings and expertises).

&amp;#x200B;

**Location wise.** As is typical of HK, the campuses of the three schools you mentioned are all convenient: the MTR runs straight into CUHK's campus at the \*University\* station; CityU's connected to a mall called Festival Walk, which is right above the MTR station \*Kowloon Tong\*; PolyU is connected to the MTR station \*Hung Hom\*. The universities are situated from north to south on the East Rail Line, in the order I described them above.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure how familiar with HK geography you are. TL;DR it's split into two halves: Kowloon (North) and Island (South). Business districts and nightlife lay along the southern end of Kowloon and northern end of the Island. The three schools we're talking about are all on the Kowloon side, with PolyU being right at the northern end of the cross-harbour tunnel leading to the Island.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall.** Depends how much you value reputation vs proximity. If you plan to live nearby the business districts and nightlife centres, PolyU&gt;CityU&gt;CUHK. If you want solid coursework and teaching, CUHK&gt;CityU=PolyU.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: Actually, now that I think about it, here are better comparisons of the schools:

* CUHK = UofT
* HKUST = UW
* HKU = McMaster
* CityU = UOIT
* PolyU = OCAD"

"No, C# or Java would be much better than C++ at competitive programming.

"Not in the course this term (took it years ago), but in general the 137 midterm is one of the harder ones in first years. I would say be comfortable with the assignments since those are likely to mirror the midterm than a short quiz would.

The amount of work that they gave us for the time that was given however was ridiculous, there was not even remotely enough time to finish the exam, let alone write it correctly and check over your answers.

"1. Easy check: push on the tires. They should bend just a little or not at all. You can also check pressure with a pressure gauge; every tire has a recommended pressure rating.
2. One, it will be harder to bike (you may have already noticed). All that internal pressure pushes the tire out so that there isn't unnecessary tire-to-ground contact (which would increase friction). Two, having flat tires risks damaging the metal/composite rims of the wheel.
3. You should be able to find bicycle tire pumps at recreation stores, like Canadian Tire, as well as online.
4. [Here's a summary of Ontario biking rules.](http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/bicycle-safety.shtml) In short, wear a proper-fitting helmet, make sure you're brightly-coloured and visible, ride as far to the right side of the road as possible, use hand signals when turning or stopping unexpectedly, and bike as if nobody can see you."
"Officially - you're not supposed to be using the Lime e-scooters on campus, only inside the [pilot route](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/living/electric-scooter-pilot.asp). You're also supposed to have a driver's license and wear a helmet.

E-scooters haven't been defined in the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, so you can't be using them on any roads. You could ride them on sidewalks, but then you're going against Lime's regulations.

Bikes are considered vehicles, so they must be on the road. Scooters and skateboards are not, so they should be on the sidewalk - but they should be ridden with care.

Ring Road is on private property - so all of these rules could be thrown out the window if the university wishes to do so. But on public roads (i.e. Lester, University, Albert, etc.) the Highway Traffic Act must be followed and Waterloo Regional Police could issue tickers to any violators if they wanted to."
"&gt;White heritage

I already specified that I was merely using the term ""white"" as a necessary simplification in a hyper-diverse environment. In a less diverse environment, white doesn't mean anything. Although it's entirely possible that a racial approach to hyper-diversity will eventually result in white identity because when you lump hundreds of groups together they're probably going to reorganize into several major groups over time. 

&gt;Education and workforce side effect

And that is a huge problem which will prevent us from taking humanity much farther unless it is fixed. Wealth makes people complacent and content in their trappings of comfort, in order to prevent a collapse people must continue to accept that life is a struggle and that the pursuit of pleasure for the sake of pleasure is meaningless. The West and pretty much the entire developed world is failing to overcome the difficulties that come with education and wealth, and so things will probably need to become difficult enough that people are forced to accept the struggle before perhaps rising once again.

Trust me as a 'bitter vet' there are a metric shit ton of people in their late 20s, 30s, even 40s who don't have things figured out or know what they really want to do.  Failure is the key to success, each mistake teaches us something.  There is absolutely no one in the history of human kind that has had their shit sorted and figured out from day one.  Your purpose in a co-op is to learn, to make mistakes, to feel like a failure and then grow from that.  when I say learn it could be learning the job, the role, the industry or learning that this isn't quite right for you.  It's better to learn this now than to graduate, get a job, and then realize you've gone down the wrong path.  There's a lot of pressure for young people to have all their ducks in a row as soon as possible and to that i say ""fuck that"". 

Start looking at other options if you feel this isn't the right path for you.  Don't feel like a failure or feel that others are looking down on you because I guarantee you they don't.  As someone who has worked with a lot of interns and co-op students I never expect the world from them but I hope they learn and figure out how to mold their future.  I hope I can share a bit of personal knowledge and life experience with them to establish their success because I didn't have that at their age and my life spiraled out of control only to get back on track in my 30s.  

So take a bit of time, reflect, and feel out what you want to do.  It's better to realize that this industry isn't for you now than to realize it in your late 40s and feeling like you're stuck.

Good luck."
"IMO finish the degree.  You risk never completing the degree for one.  Secondly, you've got what, 10 courses left?  If you take 2 courses a term, year round, you're going to be almost 2 years finishing this, and quite likely longer than that.  

The workload of ft work + a life + classes is likely more than you think.  It's easy to get burnt out, and almost guaranteed after 3-4 terms of that level.  

Not sure how flexible your work is, but scheduling classes around work is a nightmare.  Plus, travel time comes out of your workday as well.  I live say 15-20 minutes from the uni.  But I've got to park, and walk to class.  Then I have to get back to the car and drive home. And fourth year CS courses aren't going to be a nice 8:30-9:20, 9:30-10:20.  More likely 12:30-1:20 and then 2:30-3:30.  So I'd be leaving at 11:45 and not back til 4:15.  So two courses, you're away from work for 3 afternoons a week.  And that's before you even count study time, or projects.  Now schedule office hours and tutorials in there, and the time committment for two courses really adds up.  And throw in everything else (buy texts, go see academic advisor, etc) and each one of those things is now a 2 hour job out of your workday - on top of your three afternoons per week.  

Now do that for two years.  At some point you're going to want to drop down to 1 course, or take a term off.  Now your grad date gets pushed out even further.  So now you're 3 years at this.

Couple years of working ft, you're going to want a week's vacation (since work doesn't get time off after exams).  try and schedule a vacation at the start of the summer when you don't know when your exams are.  

I've been doing the working ft uni pt for a number of years, and there's nothing I'd like more than the opportunity to take a full 4 months and knock off 5 classes at once - instead of the full year of the above that I actually have to do.

"&gt; Bruh, PCs have never had the spine to force those conversations what made you think anything was going to change?

lol I know, I don't expect Scheer himself to say anything. It's just that he said he would allow the conversation, so I expected that other people like Pierre Lemieux might finally bring it up. Maybe Sam Oosterhoff will run for MP too.

&gt; They go into full meltdown whenever anyone even thinks about questioning their social movements and they have the backing of the courts and media. We need an outsider visionary with balls of steel to go down that route.

It's kind of pathetic. They're the only people that are *allowed* to be politically incorrect and keep their jobs. Let the witch hunts happen, you're already elected, smh. That's something people don't seem to realize. So the left with their army of 19-22 year old girls is hysterical and loud, so what? Look at the US where they've been collectively losing their fucking minds for months... the \#metoo, women's march with pussy hats etc... how much has it actually accomplished? Nothing, it just makes them feel good and connected to eachother. Kavanaugh was confirmed, Trump is president and he's doing almost everything he wanted to do. 

&gt; I think Bernier needs to stop talking about this so much, because most people don't really care although people do care about the hormone thing.

Agreed, the libertarian cringefest was just annoying. They seem to be unaware of how utterly (lol) shit American products are. If you want to allow European products, I'm all for it since they actually have good regulations on food.

&gt; And this is a huge problem, they have plenty of opportunities to bring forward a conservative approach to various issues even if it was just publicly encouraging parents to talk to their children about things

No need to talk to your children. The schools will ""teach"" them everything they need to know about the new world order :\^)

&gt;  Instead they spinelessly repeal things because none of these old dudes ever grew the spine to confront their hippie counterparts. 

I think that's coming to an end. It's becoming clear that the dirtbags don't have any actual tools or weapons against us other than buzzwords and witch hunts, neither of which can really do anything to legitimate ideas and leadership. It can only intimidate individuals, but at its core much of conservatism is a collective ideology so they fail to kill it off. The best they can do is spread their messages to the ignorant and dumb masses, yay democracy.

I sometimes go on Facebook on a fake account to see what these leftist pages with 10,000,000 followers are posting. It's essentially either one of two things; strawmans or whataboutisms.

A relevant example to our province is the repeal of the sex-ed curriculum. According to leftists, kids are now deprived from learning about ""consent""! Yes, that's definitely what so-cons found issue with... consent. Not the radical LGBT shit, teaching kids how to 'safely' have anal sex, teaching pre-pubescent children they can change their 'genders' etc... I want off this ride. I'm going to go apply for more American jobs now.

&gt; They should also start talking more directly to their base kind of like Trump (but maybe a little more intellectually) because we cannot trust the media not distort their message.

For sure. Anyone who trusts the media after what we've witnessed in the last year or so must be medically retarded."

A failed first midterm is entirely recoverable.

If that's the case, then you decide if you're going to commit to changing your habits or not.

"You stated that ""do we ever feel like just giving up because ""no one will like me anyways"" lol"" So that insinuates that, if no one likes you that giving up is okay, and you should only accomplish your goals if people like you.Then you go on to say that when your ""fit"" you don't feel that much different or happier.

So putting two and two together it is pretty clear that you feel like you should give up on exercising because you feel like no one would like you if you were more ""fit"". What does this insinuate? that your fitness and health are reliant on other peoples opinions on you.

I think the issue we must understand is, why do you feel like exercising does not make you any happier, or more confident?

Not looking that much different is subjective and theres various reasons as to why that might be, and also people's definition of ""fitness"" varies. What's your definition of fitness? Only looking good?

Looking good is also subjective. And who are you trying to look good for and why?And if your trying to look good for yourself, thats great.These are important questions to ask yourself but it's also important to ask yourself if your comparing your body image to anybody, whether it be a celebrity, a model, or what have you.

You stating that exercise did not help you is actually false, exercise does help your physical and mental health, regardless if you see physical changes or not, it always helps."
"The only part that I disagree with you strongly is the cause of the IQ gap, to which I strongly suggest you read the Race and Intelligence article on WIkipedia. If you have time I recommend you to check this piece out on embryo selection. https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection

You mentioned Ashkenazim jews and their IQ, to which I am sure you are aware of their high IQ and astonishing scientific achievements illustrated by the nobel prize won by those of such descent and the high incidence of medelian disorders present in the group. One of which, Torsion dystonia is associated with signifcantly higher IQ when controlled for background factor according to Wikipedia. The mechanism of the disease is very much neuronal as ""The defective protein creates a disruption in communication in neurons that control muscle movement and muscle control.""

I don't have time to find the sources for the following claims but I believe current GWAS predictors for IQ that works well in whites also work in blacks, though not as well. I'd also like to point out adoption twin studies, I believe  showed that IQ is largely heritable in both blacks and whites and strongly predict various life outcome. The only thing I seen that runs appears to contradict this narrative is that IQ is less heritable among those who have low IQ, but this might be the reason why low IQ people have low IQ because of lower robustness against environmental disturbances, e.g. canalization. I'd like to highlight the differences in lactose tolerance and skin tone that is clearly genetic and encountered strong selection pressure corresponding to the geographical origins of various groups that maps fairly well to subsets of race. And that we have clinical recommendations for blacks for hypertension treatment and we know that different race have different frequencies in variants in the genes that encodes the proteins for xenobiotic metabolism that materially affects how drugs are metabolized.

Regarding your last paragraph, there is much to be said about the content of morality, and the evolutionary biology behind why morality exist. But I will say that IQ is an imperfect measured variable that strongly correlate on latent variable(s) that most people regard as good, usually not in a good or evil manner. As someone who is an intellectual and values intellect, I do find IQ, or at least *g* to correlate pretty well with that, with *g* being the first principal component of the subtests of IQ that is very robust to the specific tests and data sets used, which is also not increasing due to the Flynn effect.

I'm not making any value judgements except those mentioned above, but subscribing to the mostly herditarian view means that affirmative action and all that will never work and that we are committing a small injustice in the other direction that is also harmful to our productivity, unless we get pretty fast changes in the genetic makeup of the populations that is comprised of the various races in the relevant loci. Additionally, if there is a substantial difference in productivity between races that is not amendable to training, then on a Bayesian view it makes sense to penalize black applicants for jobs as well (by a various amounts depending on the evidence available) because drawing members from a population of lower mean will give you a lower mean on expectation even if some imperfect testing is performed because of false positives. I am really glad that you laid out a good argument for not denying humanity to an entire race based on IQ by the way and I agree here, but clearly you see there are unpleasant implications still.

I'm sure you are aware the piece you linked is also clearly politically colored right? Not that it means the piece have no value at all, but I'm sure you can agree that the narrative it runs is almost certainly in this case in favor of the nurture side that is held and promoted by those who are on the left, which I assume you are part of.

"I'm gonna stop you right there.  Like others said, it's first year.  This will sound anecdotal (because it is) but I started undergrad in Psych, realized, this isn't for me.  Second year I started fresh in Geography which I enjoyed far more.  You may have a plan for life, but you gotta leave room to adapt to situations.  Undergrad flew by way too fast, and it's not only about the education, it's meeting tons of people, making friends (or enemies, but who needs them) and learning about who you are as a person.  You'll look back and think 'remember that time that goose charged at me, well I can laugh about that now'.

&amp;#x200B;

Please talk to your friends, or any of your professors.  Even your Don, they may be hard asses, but they have likely been where you are.  We all probably have been, but talking to each other is the first and biggest step.  Believe in yourself, like others believe in you."

"I am in a similar situation. I signed with the company I did my last co-op with and skipped my final co-op to finish my degree. I find that the last year CS courses are the most interesting so it's not a chore to go to school, Also I saved a lot of elective for my final term so I would have an easy final term. Going part time though I think you will probably just end of not finishing the degree."

Also for volunteer hours, do they look at what you did / how long or you just need to have them done?"
"Math is just used as an umbrella term, similar to Science or Engineering or any other Faculty name. Comparing the knowledge base of people in two distinct majors doesn't make a ton of sense.

"No one said it is rape. 

All rape is sexual assault not all sexual assault is rape.

Sexual assault is not mundane. Again idk how you don't understand the idea of everyone having bodily autonomy. "
"Show up everyday and do your best. Be interested in the work and communicate. It can be tough to follow a “superstar” but I will bet the previous student made errors too. As best you can, keep a positive attitude at work. Maybe take this coop term to do some deep self reflection. What learning can you take away from this term about yourself in the workplace? Don’t be too hard on yourself! "
This is why I can’t with math. I just don’t understand. And the textbooks are written so poorly. And the practice questions aren’t even helpful (the ones I’ve had in previous textbooks at least). All I can say is spend as much time with the tas as you can. The only way I can understand things is by having someone I’m not completely scared of teach me. Never learned anything in lecture.
"don't fall into the trap of ""I don't have motivation and so I am not able to do the action"". The further you get into this, the worse it is to break it. Force urself by whatever means necessary to do what you need to do. Set small goals/deadlines, hold urself accountable, make consequences for not meeting them. make rewards for meeting x amount of them. the most important part is that you do it."
"&gt; But it still falls under the racism umbrella, cuz it means you're thinking about/acting towards members of that race differently than everyone else.

I respectfully disagree.

&gt;it's when you're fetishsizing a certain race that it becomes a problem

But the Japanese invented Hentai to try and justify fetishism (among other things) as a normalcy in life^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentai#Etymology). So if someone consumes Hentai-related media, they are racist. I don't really see a problem with having a fetish for a particular race. What is inherently wrong with that? What kind of behaviors can it lead to that are actually problematic?"
"I could see that comparison but tbh idk �� there's a clear difference in accent I can hear but wouldn't exactly know how to describe (yet), (slang/expressions/tendencies to slur or squish words together/etc aside)��

35 minutes each and that's that for the section no matter what or 35 minutes and if you take more or less you can use it for other sections?�� SJ2 nice wait did you write it late fall/early winter of last year? tbh it sounds kind of fun, would try this year if it wasn't $200 hahah

Yea different slang and words etc but also occasionally the way they pronounce certain vowel sounds within words or things like that ig�� am still just learning a bit but it's q an interesting topic imo


"
"&gt; Wow you're diagnosing me a lot aren't you.

Please. Only after you insisted I have some sort of personal reason for ""needing it to be true"" that no one cares about this, multiple times.

&gt; So I'm...neurotic, obsessed, projecting, and I have issues. I think you said earlier I was insane. Gaslighting

Lol. The day the masses learned the word ""gaslighting"" from CNN's article about Trump supposedly gaslighting the public might be as bad as when they learned ""incel"". 

Gaslighting would apply, if you weren't actually being crazy. How old were you when this happened? Like 10? How does it affect counseling services *today*, 9 years later? Tell me *exactly* how this affects counseling services or anything else on campus.

Don't just say ""muh safe space"". You live in one of the safest countries in the world for fuck sake. And if there's a new rapist or butt toucher at counseling services, I'm sure he'll be gone quite quickly in today's hyper-feminist environment. 

&gt; Maybe not many others cared before me. Now I care, along with new others. I expect more will care, after us. The care, voices, actions are just growing. Not just in the US, but right here at UW too.

Right. As I thought. You've been worked up into a frenzy by the media and the \#metoo movement. Maybe put down your smartphone and go outside. Do you actually want to be thinking about sexual assault all the time?

&gt; The Kavanaugh attack on Dr Ford was 36 years ago. 

The *alleged* attacks. Are you the courts now? You consume American mass media and suddenly you're a lawyer or judge?

I also find it mighty convenient that Dr. Ford's only recent peer-reviewed paper is on potential alternative medical effects of the abortion pill, and Kavanaugh may repeal Roe v Wade. Seems like she has some motives. The millions of dollars she's made can't hurt either.

I guess you think Trump was elected by Putin too right? I'm actually quite happy that the left has their own conspiracy theories now. It makes them seem more like normal people that I can sympathize with.

&gt; This affects me yes. And everyone else here, directly or indirectly. Having safe spaces benefits us all. Safe for our female psychologists. Safe for young women who visit Counselling Services. As interns or students. All are being harmed by this man and those promoting him and his actions directly or indirectly.

I'm assuming this David Mackay no longer works at counseling services. So what's the problem, exactly? The law served its purpose 9 years ago, you can resume your life. 

No one is ""promoting his actions"". The way you write is insufferable, you know? You're complaining that I seem to be psychologically analyzing you, what choice do I have? You say nothing direct. 

""*some people* (maybe you, just saying) are *indirectly* promoting this man's actions""

So tiresome. I'm just telling you to move on with your life. There is no reason to be obsessed with this, or the Kavanaugh thing."

Anyone heard about snowflake? Just received an email said they had submitted interview selection to the coop office but nothing happened on WW.
Balough and mansour are the ones that typically do 105 and neither of them have such a restriction. 5% sounds way too low of a fail rate for 1A

"Just saying I got a 68 on the first midterm and finished with an 88. (First one was only 10% for me, and it was my very first ever uni midterm)"
Meeting the cutoff doesn't mean you get admitted. Waterloo says you need a 78% for some of its programs but in reality a mid 80 is competitive.
Nah that ain’t it homie. Keep going tho. Hey ur putting more effort into it than ur resume LMAO get it? Because you’re so fucking mediocre

this is why i can never visit my high school friends or talk to them. I don't really wanna face any of them until I consider myself successful.

Iunno about you but I need like 10 SUV trips to carry the furniture I'm keeping at my parents house if I was to actually move all of it sooo 25% seems accurate. It's like 1 trip per 1-2 pieces and I've got enough in their basement rn for my house sooo I guess having tables and couches and a guest bed is degenerate now. "
"The argument is that the saturation of public sector involvement in higher education has made all of higher education more expensive; including private sector education. I appreciate that every time someone says public sector schooling is expensive, everyone goes “but look at the private sector costs”. They’re not mutually exclusive. They are very much related. Also directly related is loans to subsidize the industry. 

The gist of all this is to say, we are completely powerless as consumers to fight the increase in prices. They will continue to outpace inflation and wage growth. The government is not on your side nor will they be. What are they going to do? Limit tuition increase further? But then how will they be able to pay their employees more every year? These employees are coveted voters. Students aged 18-25 are not. Privatization is not the answer, true accountability to tax payers is."
"**Also, Feds is having a General Meeting next week.** This is where all undergraduate students have the ability to come and discuss/vote on proposals relating to organization’s governance. I highly recommend that anyone who is able to attend.

**When/Where?** Wednesday, October 24th starting at noon in the SLC Great Hall

**What?** The [agenda](https://feds.ca/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/2018_feds_agm_agenda.pdf) includes the following:

* Bylaw amendments reforming how future GMs are done (including addition of online voting) and aiming to make the whole governance structure more accountable (see pages 54-73 of the agenda package for a friendly summary and please ask about this)
* Bylaw amendment to change which executives can vote on the Board of Directors
* Motion relating to the eligibility for the health and dental plan and UPASS
* Motion relating to more in depth reviewing of certain portions of the Feds budget
* Motion relating to the operation of Feds’s commercial services
* and more…

**What if I can’t attend?** Try to proxy your vote to another student who will be attending. Each person can take one proxy. The [proxy form](https://feds.ca/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/feds_gm_proxyform.pdf) must be submitted to the Feds front desk or to pres@feds.ca no later than noon on October 22nd. [Also, a livestream of the meeting will be available.](https://new.livestream.com/UWFeds)"
"So some bylaw reforms are coming that were ordered by the Fall 2017 AGM which allow some of the following:

* Give Council some teeth to hold Board accountable to students (currently Council is supposed to but lacks any capacity what so ever to actually enforce their corporate policies and what not).

* Make recall threshold (to initiate a recall referendum) for Councillors and Executives lower by adding an absolute threshold (now it's 10% or 500). 

* Allowing recall referendums, petitions, and all other forms of ""in writing"" orders to the Federation to be done electronically (likely through vote.feds.ca when this rolls out, if the bylaws pass).

* Reduce the threshold for removal of a Director to a simple majority (50%+1 of votes cast) instead of 2/3 vote (this is also Corporations Act compliance).

* Have a selection/screening process for Directors to vet and recommend candidates to the GM rather than just whoever shows up with 30 friends; this will also help us open-up Director selection to students on co-op too.

* Forcing Councillors -- who are delegates under the Corporations Act already -- to legally act in the best interests/on behalf of the shareholders/members (students). 

* Other changes... but I am running to breakfast. If you want more let me know!! Happy to go through this more. I was on the bylaw and procedure re-write team that helped execute these changes at the GM's orders. So far Council recommended these changes for adoption and Board approved them, the last step is ratification by the AGM this year.

EDIT: there's also a few other items on the Agenda for this year that will help with financial accountability to members (eg. requiring all budgets to be vetted by the student filled _Budget &amp; Appropriations Committee_ before the Board can vote on them... this was submitted by a member-at-large; and a motion about commercial operations losses also submitted by a member-at-large)."

Stat 431 is tied for the easist 4xx stat course IMO (with 430 if Pengfei is teaching it), and stat332 is very straightforward as well.

CS330 is apparently really easy but also really dry

STAT333 is one of those courses where it's hard to understand enough material to get a 80 but once you're there its easy to get to a 95. 

STAT340 is quite straightfoward and the workload isn't too heavy."
"easy 90 with minimal effort tbh

The entire course is pretty much two things:


1. calculating NPV of two or more projects then determining which one has the highest 
2. finding the deadweightloss or social surplus (e.g. Producer + consumer surplus) when there are market imperfections (e.g. monopoly)

if you know those two things (the textbook explains ALL of it), you will find this course bird

"&gt;look at my notes for hours

Learn to study more actively. Reading notes is by far the worst way to ""study""

You should be writing notes and thoughts, quizzing yourself (or having people quiz you), and doing practice problems. Have discussions about the topic too.

I would say that in math and physics at least 80% of your time should be dedicated to doing and *completing* problems without guidance. When you finish a problem you feel good because you made progress, which motivates you to do more.

Also, spend like 45 minutes working to 15 minutes chilling, passively reading materials, or doing something else. This technique helps curb defocusing."
"97 sq ft for a place to sleep and put a desk isn't too bad. Most places on like lester/albert/sunview in the 5 person suites are like around 120 sq ft for their bedrooms so it's not too much smaller.

"If whiteness is the criteria, yes. If it's more about a cultural fit or an attraction to a certain physical feature that is often found in white people (eg, green eyes or a light hair color), then no because then the race itself isn't the criteria and it just happens to be highly correlated with a certain group of people.

Same thing goes for yellow fever. It's only racism because ""Asian"" is a criteria for the person you want to date (vs, for example a preference for black hair + olive skin, or having a preference for someone who speaks Korean or Tagalog or something), because it's too broad to have any meaning beyond fetishsizing an entire group. "
"Sorry I should revise that statement for this case; it only counts if it's _funded_. If your professor has a grant out of which he can fund you because you aren't eligible for the research council grant, that's equally valid, but you have to be luckier because not all faculty have independent funding. You're going to work very hard because your aim is to get at least something published at the end of 4 months, which is quite difficult. Not being funded at all makes it even harder. On the other hand, if you're providing your own funding, it might seem like there's less pressure to produce results, which could be good or bad depending on the student."
"You CAN technically switch into CS regular for 1B, but this will raise a lot of problems. You will get kicked out of res cuz u would no longer be a laurier student, which means you would have to find your own off campus housing.

It is a huge nightmare, so although you CAN drop before 1B it is advisable to wait until the end of first year before dropping. I am pretty much in the same boat as you lol. Business degrees (especially a bachelors) are completely useless, so the only reason you should consider staying in DD is for the coop (albeit from Laurier). "

"Hey there,
I had a similar problem when I was in 1A math, back in 2016. I felt stupid because I 'worked' on assignments for about 80 hours a week and still couldn't finish them. My main issue was that most of this 'work' was staring at things, not knowing what to do. I had a messy year after that, but I learned a few things from it:
If you're staring at something unable to finish it, work on something else, right away. If you do this, you use your time waaay more efficiently. (I cut back my workload about 30 hrs)
Take electives that can give you a break from math courses. Having something to take your mind off things while still being productive feels really good.
If you think you may have troubles with depression, I would suggest signing up with a counselor BEFORE things escalate. 
I have been doing these things this term to some degree of success, and it's made a really big difference for me. ^_^

"I would propose 2 mechanisms:

1. Express outrage. The Uni doesn't like the negative press much. This policy in specific should be demanded to have student consultation from Students' Council (your representatives), Dons (since they have to enforce it), and other stakeholders.

2. Email your UW Undergrad Senators and Feds Execs and demand reforms to the Policy mechanism. Policy G mechanism is the only policy mechanism (on initial scan) that doesn't require any consultation or approval from stakeholding groups. We should be demanding consultation -- even nonbinding -- and hopefully approval (by undergraduate committees or something) for policies which affect undergraduates.

Ninja Edit: as for this policy... the President (Feridun) can sign it and bring it into force immediately; so this will likely come into force sometime today, or tomorrow, or whenever the Secretary of the Uni hands it to Feridun."

The role of trustee was designed as a part time office, like councilor. Though regardless, I have every intention of prioritizing this highly and ensuring that I'm doing more than a part time job. I appreciate your concern."
"Rasengan is stronger. Sasuke himself realized and stated so.

There is this scene that shows the damage caused by a rasengan vs the damage caused by a chidori - the rasengan won hands down.

If you look a the nature of the jutsu, it also makes sense. Chidori is a collection of lightning chakra used as a strike, whereas rasengan is a rotating ball of chakra. By adding rotation to pure energy, there is additional force and damage upon the point of impact.

If chidori is a sword, rasengan is a hammer, an incredibly heavy hammer.

"In all your years of recruitment, how many thousands of tech boys (and lesser degree, girls) have you just simply forgotten, because they are entirely replaceable and without personality of any sort?  

How many times have you picked up a resume and skimmed it, and your brain went into a kind of automatic opiate mode, where you know everything that's on that stupid resume before you even throw it into the ""reject"" bin?

how many times have you interviewed a nervous STEM dude and found yourself wondering ""hmm, I hope Zehr's has fresh cilantro today.."" or ""Did I interview this guy before?""

Or maybe thought ""Guy, I already know our company's product is BS, so I can hear all the techniques you are saying to pretend it matters, don't worry, I'm looking for a new job myself so don't waste your breath pretending this software makes a damn lick of anything in the real world.""

"Thanks for your thoughts here.

Dr Morgan reported on much more than what holyfuck... tries to gaslight here. 

There were other incidents of reprisal through intimidation in hallways by Dave Mackay against Dr Morgan for reporting him. Dr Morgan also made claims of reprisal by UW against her, including that she could not report an incident of intimidation unless there was actual physical contact. The adjudicator denied her reprisal claims, but I believe her.

I'd be interested to know how UW has treated her compared to the others involved in the years since the incident, regarding career paths etc.

The original 2009 incident is below.

While at a work event, Dr Morgan witnessed her coworker Dave Mackay kneeling and going down on Dr Winter though Dr Winter's clothes while Dr Winter stood. Dr Winter was too drunk to give her consent, or even remember the incident afterwards. This is sexual assault. Dr Morgan was concerned for Dr Winter.

When Dr Morgan tried to put a stop to it, Dave Mackay approached Dr Morgan. Dr Morgan signalled to him not to. Dave Mackay went out of Dr Morgan's eyesight as Dr Morgan talked with Dr Winter. Dave Mackay then 


Here is the quote from the relevant section from the CanLII link about the original incident.

[51]        Dr. Morgan testified that after viewing Mr. Mackay on his knee before Dr. Winter, she approached Dr. Winter to ask her about leaving the event.  She testified that Mr. Mackay saw her approaching and had got up from being on one knee with some difficulty, which Dr. Morgan attributed to Mr. Mackay’s alcohol consumption.  She testified that Mr. Mackay said to her “Oh Tracey, you are so beautiful, so beautiful, that’s such a beautiful dress”.  Dr. Morgan testified that when Mr. Mackay took a step towards her she put her arms up with her palms up to indicate that Mr. Mackay should not come closer.  She testified that she then stepped back and began to talk to Dr. Winter about leaving. 

[52]        Dr. Morgan testified that Mr. Mackay then moved closer to Dr. Morgan and Dr. Winter and when he realized that they were discussing leaving said “goodbye, Kathy, goodbye Tracy” and then kissed Dr. Winter on the cheek.  Dr. Morgan testified that Mr. Mackay then turned to her to kiss her on the cheek.  Dr. Morgan testified that she put up her left arm in front of her face to block Mr. Mackay’s attempted kiss as she did not want him to kiss her goodbye.  She testified that when she continued to talk to Dr. Winter, Mr. Mackay came up to her left side (approaching her from behind), put his right arm around her waist and then lowered his right hand onto her right buttock.  She testified that he then deliberately applied pressure with his hand for about two seconds.  She testified that she then elbowed Mr. Mackay with her left elbow.  She testified that Mr. Mackay then walked forward to Dr. Winter put his right hand out around her wrist and pulled her onto the dance floor.

[53]        Dr. Morgan testified that she felt nauseous and close to vomiting, that she was in shock as a result of Mr. Mackay’s actions.  She testified that she felt she had been objectified by what had happened. ..."

"Hi there, thanks for the questions! I feel that I'm in a unique situation mainly because I am both a recent graduate of public education and I served on a Board of Trustees. Though, above these two things, I'm the only one between my fellow candidates talking about change within the classroom. Most Trustees focus on board logistics (bus routes, building repairs, etc.) and don't get me wrong, those are very important items. Though an education system needs to focus on education first, and that focus has been lost in the recent years unfortunately.

As far as what I have specifically done: as a student trustee, I formed one of the first ever high school entrepreneurship incubators for student entrepreneurs. We connected with various incubators across the region and paired students with seasoned entrepreneurs to help get their ideas off the ground, all while earning coop credits. I also pushed for more budgeting of technology for the classroom. Though I do admit my experience is still minimal. As a student trustee, I had one year in office. While I dislike compromising and prioritizing, I recognize when it's necessary, and as a student trustee I had to focus on the few initiatives I was implementing to ensure they would be a success.

The reason I disagree with the lecture style classroom is because each teacher teaches in their own way. The probability that each student will resonate well with the teacher's style of teaching is very small. Don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for collective teaching (aka lectures) but I feel that class time should be more focused on in-depth discussion of material. I do recognize it's a balancing act though, and neither extremes is optimal. I simply believe that the current state is far from optimal and it's going to take experimentation to find better methods, and experimentation is key.

I also recognize that as  CS student, I am more focused on STEM related subjects. Though I believe that everyone has their areas of specialties. Don't get me wrong, I will work hard to gain a breadth understanding, but everyone has their specific areas and I choose to embrace mine. The Board of Trustees is a team, each trustee bringing their areas of expertise to the table in order to work collaboratively.

Finally, what I like in current education is mainly the reinforcement. I believe many progressive education styles like to focus on speed of learning to show good results, but we need to understand that learning is only valuable when it is ingrained extensively. I think education today does a decent job at that (still not perfect though).

Hope I answered your questions! (Sorry if I rambled, I'm really passionate about education)"

"~70%, makes sense IMO. 

Some people fail, some people start working full time, and some people realize it isn't their passion.

"I'm not arguing with you any further about weed. You're free to believe what you want. 

""Am I a war veteran or something?""

No, I'm not. I was raped last year. It's not curing my PTSD, but it's making me able to sleep at night without terrible panic attacks. I never claimed it was curing it, not all drugs exist to ""cure things"". I've been doing extensive therapy, but while the trial is happening, it's been very difficult for me to make much progress. My health care providers suggested it, and in fact, I've been smoking it ""legally"" this entire time. 

I've tried other drugs - many benzodiazepines and other sedatives - but nothing has been successful.

I understand weed won't cure my PTSD, but therapy will and I need something to at least allow me to sleep so that I'm able to function normally and so that what happened to me doesn't completely destroy my ability to do the things I love and need to do.

"I'm not pushing it as some innocent thing.

I, and about 2 BILLION people, drink alcohol from time to time. Due to my age, I drink it more than most, which I suspect will change when I finish university. I understand that there are negative side effects to it, but as an adult, I make the choice to drink anyways. I'm by no means an alcoholic. Society seems to think that's fine, but when the topic of weed comes up, people go crazy.

You're free to not drink or to not smoke weed, but it doesn't mean you should expect others to not because YOU FEEL that it is so terrible. 

I smoke weed during the evenings to sleep as I struggle with severe PTSD. Unless I've told someone, people have NO IDEA. Since you believe SO much in personal experience, I can tell you that in my personal experience, my life has not changed since I started, besides a little better sleep and a bit more of an appetite for an hour or so.

"I have been through a similar thing with a family member and their mom. Never ever stop bettering yourself. You need to grieve, and you should but also use that sadness as energy and a catalyst to keep you in school keep you motivated and keep you successful so you can graduate and land a great job and make your mom proud. She would have wanted that. 

My advice is to never let yourself fall into the dark place. Don’t get lost in your head and don’t get lazy and comfortable. Make your life story one of Eric success against all odds.

Sorry for your loss,  keep your head up! "
"I'd say you have three options:

1) Give it time. Pick up a new hobby or past-time to distract you. Make sure you reflect appropriately to give yourself closure and learn from your past mistakes

2) Find a good person/friend to vent to. This can help with closure as well

3) Depending on the relationship you had and currently have with your ex you could consider reaching out to them. If you ended things on a good note, then you can express your concerns and talk out your issues to help find you closure.

Tinder might be a short-time solution, but if you are still truly emotionally invested in your ex then you are just doing longer term emotional damage."
"Just say hi to coworkers when you see them in the morning is, if it's monday ask them how their weekend was and what they did, and even if you find it extremely uninteresting try to listen closely and chime in here or there. If it's not a monday ask them if they did anything last night, if they say they did nothing you can make a joke and be like ""aye same"". Hopefully they will also ask you how your weekend or night was, and then you can talk about what you did as well and maybe a new conversation will spring off of this.

I'm a pretty awkward guy but I kinda make fun of myself when I do something awkward and usually people find that a little bit funny."
"Ideally I spend at least 6-12 hours over a weekend doing raw practice problems, and maybe an hour or two writing summaries and reviewing concepts. I pair this with continuous review every day for about an hour starting a week or so before the exam. If I do this I manage 80s. I have managed to do this with PHYS122, MATH138 (final).

On a normal midterm, I will scramble for 2 hours the night before to do a few problems, give up on the hard ones, then spend the morning before the midterm reading the book. I usually get low 70s on these midterms. Fortunately, doing assignments is usually enough to drill the content into my head (unless i miss assignments like i did in MATH235, man that class could have gone better).

As far as this term is going, I am going for at least 15 hours of review for each - 80/20 balance of problems/concepts respectively. I am in PHYS275/AMATH231/PMATH347/PMATH331/PHYS236 this term."

"I was going to say something similar. Last fall, I went through a few stressful situations that lead to me not being able to do school. I ended up petitioning and getting half my tuition back and a WD on all the classes on my record. I think if you drop your courses now (after asking about it first), the school wouldn't have a problem giving you a pardon. 

Take care and I wish you the best of luck, OP."
"Most people I know IRL know I'm an ugly virgin loser, if that's what you mean by incel. I don't use the word incel to describe myself, however.

Anyways, the point is that only a small subset of any given real life community will actively partake in something like Reddit. Furthermore, those who are active online often share characteristics which are not necessarily common among the community as a whole."
"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cbruni/Math135Resources/index.php

Work through the Midterm resources - randomized problems (and any other problems on the site)

Personally I never found redoing assignments useful - I could always just remember the answer and didn't feel like I was actually practicing. If you finish those then there are some other resources from similar courses from other unis I can recommend."
"Nice nice, ik it's a 101 course and therefore has to be basically suited to no prior knowledge etc but how did you find the difficulty level?�� and what is the approx workload/mark scheme for China101 specifically 

Oui you got it�� how long were you in immersion for?

Agreed, quite skilled�� is like it's just him and the piano 

aw will keep the offer in mind thank you, do you happen to know about what time of morning qnc starts to get packed etc? 

English, and for the rest it depends on the level of proficiency you'd consider high enough to count as knowing a language�� Depending on the answer then maybe french and ukrainian too, hbu? "
"Only thing I did was chinese school. I did take extra math and english classes on weekends, but I wouldn't consider them tutoring sessions. I did those classes because my parents thought they would help me with my day school classes. Dropped chinese school in grade 5 (I don't remember why. I guess part of the reason is because my teacher hated me after teaching me for three years and didn't want me anymore. She liked my brother though). I finished all the English classes, but it made no difference in my grade in day school for english. I then dropped math class afterwards because they were poorly taught, and I learnt more from my day school math classes."
"At other schools people seem to care about sports, club night, student events, etc., which I'm not really into. I think a lot of us in technical programs share some similar interests, and so UW has larger communities for things like MtG, gaming, anime, etc., which is nice because these hobbies are a bit more fringe elsewhere.

Also, any time you have questions about school or internships there's usually someone one this subreddit who can help you out, which is really cool. People applying for software jobs in particular have a pretty easy time finding study buddies for interview prep, which would be a really lonely grind if you didn't have people to ~~complain~~ study with.

I'm in the US right now for a co-op term and I can still find other people from UW to hang out with, which is awesome considering that most of my non-UW friends at work are the only ones here from their schools. 

Also, when you consider the fact that every other school's online student presence is limited to shitty ""overheard at X"" facebook pages, this subreddit is fucking awesome. A lot of our humour pokes fun at the mutual suffering we all go through during exam/co-op hiring season, and I actually like that because it helps to know that I'm not the only one stressing out.

I'm coming from the perspective of someone in CS with a lot of interests stereotypical of someone in the field though, so I can totally understand why people who aren't in a technical program and would be more interested in a traditional student would feel differently. I also like that our coursework is fairly rigourous, so maybe the school stress doesn't affect me as much as others.

tl;dr - I appeciate y'all &lt;3"
"The recent conservative movement doesn't seem that moderate to me.

Conservatism to me is about wanting to ensure we don't jump head first into something, and preferring the status quo to taking risks, and taking calculated risks that are healthily based in reality.

Research is in, and what CPC is arguing for is no longer in line with reality.

I lean left not because I am a leftist, and when it comes to some topics, leftists do compare me to the far right, but because the policies proposed and supported by current PC and CPC parties actively go against all sensible recommendations provided through careful research. That disregard for truth is reckless abandon.

I advocate for a UBI because using identical numbers to current welfare could save a significant amount of money and allow for a more efficient government. It just so happens we could also dramatically increase funding and still save government spending by ditching the ludicrous amount of overhead in policing a failing system. The markets would do a pretty good job for adjusting if we set the bar high enough and used it to dramatically reduce minimum wage, people could work for less and have the same buying power. Ford isn't going to reduce the minimum wage and implement a good alternative though... A reduced minimum wage and a strong system with little overhead costs, it could allow small businesses to flourish.

Regardless, the current system isn't working, and austerity has only made things worse, its time for us to look to research and act in a way that allows for meaningful change towards a better future.

If we meet the leftists halfway inbetween, we have a better chance of making these changes, but people don't seem to be up on cooperation much these days.

Politics of hate and personal attacks don't make things better, they only deepen the problem.

As time has gone on, and we've become more certain the old methods are not solving the problems we claim them to solve, with new methods gaining greater certainty in their effectiveness, its time for the systems to change, and its time for us to at least put in an effort to solve the problems, rather than hoping addicts will put their needles down."

"Muay Thai IMO is a good way to meet people, get in shape, gain confidence, and reduce social anxiety. I'd say go for it if you have the time and money."

Yes. I think I got like 16% on A2 because I was really dumb. That turned into a motivated A3 and A4 which I think averaged at like high 70s I wanna say

"With the number of bars and clubs in Waterloo, with ~half of the target audience being UW students, there shouldn't be a reason a bar on campus isn't profitable (or at least breaking even).

"They stopped having a marked ceca resume for eng and now have engineering undergrad TAs critique resumes one-on-one. Down side is that the material on learn is still the same misleading BS, and quality of the critique really depends on the TA who may or may not be in the same/related eng discipline. But to me seems way more valuable than the marked resume assignment with a strict rubric that makes no sense. Speaking to the CECA reps that trained the TAs, they surprisingly seem to know about better common resume practices for tech (one page, no objective, etc), but seems like nobody bothers updating the material for CFE (which is prolly what's used in PD1)"

I'm a 1A stream 8 mechatronics student. I will be looking for a co-op starting Jan 2019, for May 2019. This will be my first co-op term.

"This has happened to me many many times, and so one time I decided to dig deep.

I started up conversations with all of them, and some of them didn't go anywhere but one girl in particular started acting all sexual. She told me that she was horny and that she was watching porn, and that I was attractive and that she wanted to add me on WeChat so she can do ""fun things"". 

So I obliged and made a throwaway WeChat account and added this girl. She immediately wanted to video chat me and told me she was naked. So then she called me and I picked up and I actually saw a naked asian girl. She then started touching herself and kept on telling me to show her my dick. She went on for a while until I got quite creeped out and so then I quit the video chat, blocked her on WeChat and Facebook.

I don't really entirely know still what their purpose was, but I'm just gonna assume they're just extremely horny or something."
"I supported the proposed bylaw amendment to remove the VP SL and VP Ed's *voting rights at Board*. I think u/GreenBurette (thanks for the great summary, though!) should update their comment so as not to be misleading. My reasoning is simple: the Executive Committee can almost hold a Board hostage or force items through. If someone doesn't show up to a meeting and they have a director or two in their pocket, they have all the votes necessary to push through something that other Directors on Board disagree with wholeheartedly. As the most unified voting block at Board, it's important that we try to limit their ability to fuck shit up. If they want to push something through that they believe is good, now they need to *convince* other members of the Board. My hope is that the VP SL and VP Ed will put more effort into persuasive arguments to sway members of the Board, and it heavily reduces the possibility that Exec can shove a bylaw change or decision through Board in their favor. 

There's a good possibility that the VP SL and VP Ed will be rallying staff to come help them vote this bylaw amendment down, so please encourage your friends to show up to the meeting and vote, and come out yourselves! 

I wanted to submit a bylaw amendment remove Staff voting rights at the GM (because it's absolutely insane that staff can show up in force to a meeting, vote something down, and then leave, killing quorum and the rest of the meeting). However, given that the Task Force had a bunch of bylaw amendments they wanted to go through, I figured it would be best if the meeting weren't crippled by staff. Don't worry, though, there's always next term and the Council of Delegates. "

* The Quantum Nano Center (QNC) did not exist
* The SLC was about half it’s current size
* East Campus (EC)  belonged to BlackBerry
* we only had two math buildings (MC and  DC)...   it’s not like anyone uses the third one, though 
* Eduroam  wasn’t on campus… It wasn’t even available in Canada
* Waterloo didn’t have its own football stadium ( we shared a stadium with Laurier)"

"1) Squeeze them together, if they compress even a little bit it could use some air. Optimally, there should be enough pressure so that it doesn't compress at all but it's not always possible to pump it everyday. Try to pump it every week or two. 

2) Harder to ride, easier to get flats. Pinch flats are pretty common if you don't have enough pressure in them. What happens is when if you got over a bump or an edge, if you don't have enough pressure your tube gets pinched and that causes a flat which will require you to replace your tube. Having your tires pumped/high pressure prevents it from being pinched. It's kind of a pain so always try to keep it pumped.

"Would you rather Council say ""encourage""? IMO ""allowing"" is perfectly clear and acceptable language. I think you're getting caught up in your own anger over the issue when you say it FedS' legitimacy suffers because they're ""encoding extra barriers"". The particular referendum that birthed this was stupid back then, and it's still stupid now. Seems like you're not willing to accept the referendum decision anyway, even though ""Referenda are the most direct expression of students"", as you say. 

Back to the original point, why would council care about explicitly coding more complexity into its policy when ""allowing"" serves the same exact purpose and is simpler? "

\- Unless they changed their processes, the meet &amp; greet means that you've gotten an offer

\- It was really really fun, it was a great first co-op experience (co-op cohort all became friends and still chat even now)

\- The work is sorta different depending on accelerator/incubator - accelerator is more 1 large project you work on all term, incubator is a bunch of smaller proof of concept projects

\- Mentors/supervisors were super helpful and super nice, are really willing to sit next to you and work through a problem with you; def learned a lot of new things

\- For the accelerator there was code review which helps you improve coding skills

\- Salary might average about 21/hour, not like super high but pretty good for first coop (this was for first co-op as dev, other positions might be different)"

"From another thread:

How this is normal in Canada, I'll never know.

Before high school, where I met these two, there were zero Chinese kids in my school. There was only one (half) black kid and he was a violent idiot that no one liked. Everyone else was white.
One time I walked through Chinatown in Toronto.

"I totally understand keeping budgets private for competitive reasons....if the business was doing well and had a good strategy. Trust hun, no one is looking to copy our failing business models. 

What's more, there is enough differentiation between the surrounding businesses that it wouldn't be that threatening. UW Food services and others offer fast food, Inews does convince food such as chips and candy and the bomber is a sit down restaurant. but if it really bothers you fine. Keep the budgets private from businesses while making them accessible to students, there should be a way to disclose it covertly. It's 2018 and we attend the most innovative university"
"The current space is gigantic, and feels super empty which makes people not want to go. So, you could make the restaurant smaller by splitting the current space in two with some sort of retractable wall, and only open up the full space when you have a big event like Bomber Wednesday. The other half of the space can be used for something else during normal hours.  

Get new servers (I've had rude service there too) or consider counter service like they have at grad house. Make the menu smaller and make sure what stays on the menu is of good quality and fits the needs of most students. Make sure the alcohol choices align with what people actually want to drink. "

I don't think anyone likes being approached by ugly girls... unless they are themselves around that level of attractiveness, and in that case they won't be too stringent on the details (is it feminine to do the first move? etc.)

For guys above your league, they are consciously turned off by you (again, """"""if"""""""" you are ugly) so you might as well give up (it's awkward for everyone honestly) OR just not give a fuck and do it (i.e have balls and no doubt the personality and spirit that comes with it) not caring about the details of what they might be turned off by (since that's going to be the default)"

"Contrary to the other response, I found [UWaterloo Policy #29](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-29) which states (along with some definitions and scope and etc.; click the link for full details):

&gt;The University prohibits smoking:
&gt;
&gt;* in any building, bus shelter or other enclosed area;
&gt;
&gt;* in University owned or operated vehicles;
&gt;
&gt;* within 10 meters of any building;
&gt;
&gt;* on or within 20 meters of sports playing fields, surfaces and spectator areas;
&gt;
&gt;* on or within 20 meters of children’s playgrounds;
&gt;
&gt;* on restaurant and bar patios.
&gt;
&gt;Individuals engaging in smoking on University Property must dispose of all disposable components of a smoking device safely and in designated receptacles.
&gt;
&gt;The sale, promotion or display of tobacco products is strictly banned on University Property.

This doesn't explicitly mention cannabis vs. tobacco but since some of the legislation is leaning towards allowing you to smoke cannabis wherever you can also smoke tobacco, this would suggest that you may be able to smoke cannabis on campus (after it's legalized) in certain places."

"Eye colour isn't really changeable (coloured contacts, especially for guys aren't very socially acceptable, and so having natural green eyes would be better than having fake green eyes. The same is not true about hair colour though)

To you second point, that's why I think reasons matter, someone could also like a particular skin colour for purely cosmetic reasons. You could argue that they might have some deeper reason, but I think that argument could be made for eye colour too (although admittedly the reasons are more likely to be nefarious for skin colour). For example they might think that people with blue eyes and blond hair and superior to other people.

"This answer is far too simplistic to be of any help.

Many incels focus too much on physical flaws they have, when a lot of their problems are also cause by their personality (including things like confidence). Sometimes they're not even as ugly as they think they are. Although, I'm not saying being ugly and short doesn't make things harder, because it certainly does.

However saying it's just confidence and self love is also delusional. Even putting physical traits aside there are many other things that are important, social skills, self-awareness, humour, loyalty, honesty, etc... 

And skills like athletic or musical skill, that make you more attractive, that you can also work on (although you should work on them for yourself and not just to be more attractive).

If you're super confident and don't have any social skills you're fucked, until you improve on those skills. Just being confident is far from enough "

**If you don't want to have to worry about attendance in the future, support item #5a on the agenda to allow online voting, increase accountability of Feds, and to strengthen representative powers of Council** (_instead of 50 people who force things through at a GM_)."

"&gt;I still can’t tell if he’s interested tbh I don’t know if I am either

sounds like you're either being dishonest here or you're wasting your time

&gt;I don’t really want to go through the whole process of finding someone else right now but I feel like I can do better than this guy.

What's the point of getting with a guy you're not interested in? 

- if you are interested in this dude

you don't need to pretend to be disinterested to a bunch of redditors when you're on a throwaway to begin with, nobody cares if it makes you seem ""desperate""

- if you aren't interested

move on

it really isnt worth anybody's time, especially if he's busy with school"
"Most of us aren't so passionate about the major that we are studying right now at all. Your friends are passionate about this because this is what they are interested in, they are lucky. But most of us aren't very lucky. I like traveling and doing games and shit. But unfortunately, none of these are the subjects that we have in this school.

Don't expect too much about your life at a university like Waterloo, if you want life or study the thing that you are truly interested in, go to Laurier.

My friend, just go do Coop, get out of here and make lots of money, as soon as you have money, you can do what whatever you want, dreams, passion all those will come true."
"My non co-op friends didn't push as hard to land internships every year but all of them ended up doing at least one software internship before they graduated, and they're doing fine now. If you're more ambitious and you really want to go to SV or something then you'll need to push harder than someone in co-op but the opportunity is still there.

The key here is that without co-op you have to be self motivated and driven enough. 

Laurier based DDs did fine for themselves, although fewer landed higher end CS jobs. I'd say if you look at the avg laurier CS DD he would have more experience than the non co-op CS student but you can always work harder to beat the avg"
"This is a tough subject, lots of people don't procreate because they're just not ""good"" enough. 

Yes straight people who do not have children also burden the system. However its pretty much a given that some people won't have children whether they are straight or gay. I just think its important to promote characteristics that will allow society to function. If our social safety nets were to vanish tomorrow we would have huge problems (crime, looting, violence, etc). If we don't want our society to regress to third world levels then we should as a society keep in mind the characteristics that allow us to live in such decadence, before trying to tear it all down."
"Wtf is wrong with your parents why are they jumping straight to killing your pets just to get you to clean it wtf. 

Also FYI even cleaning your hamsters cage once a week might be too often and stress them out. It's better to just spot clean every once couple of days in their washroom area (better yet, you can try to litter train them with a litter tray or a jar or a house thing - won't work with all hams but most are pretty clean and will go in one spot) and change all of the bedding once a month. This also depends on how big your cage is tho. If it's smaller you have to clean it more often and if it's bigger you can get away with just spot cleaning for longer."
"Yeah they send TONS of emoticons. Like every few messages is either an emoticon or a FB sticker.....

And often they’re even heart eyes, or heart eye reactions to messages. It would be more harmless in my POV if it wasn’t so consistent. But it happens a lot. And I’ve told them it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable and upset, but truthfully it seems like they don’t want to change the way they act/communicate this other person 

So that’s kind of where I’m stuck. I feel like I don’t want to be too suspicious but they give me reasons to think otherwise. It’s hard to not come off as controlling, which is something they have told me they don’t like. "
"From the linked article

&gt;4. Legal Framework 

&gt;In addition to the abovementioned “Related Policies, Guidelines and Procedures”, the policy will be construed in accordance with applicable law, in particular:

&gt;    Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19 (“OHRC”);
&gt;    Smoke-Free Ontario Act, S.O. 1994, c. 10 (“SFOA”) and Regulation 48/06
&gt;    Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 7, Sched. 3

&gt;If any of these legal provisions are modified, abrogated, superseded, or added to, the policy will be interpreted in accordance with the new legal framework.

Both the Smoke-Free Ontario Act and Electronic Cigarettes Act have been replaced by new legislation that includes rules about weed, so policy 29 almost certainly applies. That doesn't stop the university from adding extra restrictions; I'm going to wait for clarification from the university before I think about smoking on campus."
"In my opinion you’re comparing apples to oranges. You’re comparing the process of wanting to date or hooking up, to actually hooking up. The issue isn’t hypocrisy of nicegirls and niceguys, it’s the approach to sex. There’s a different vulnerability when you have sex with someone rather than buying a drink or flirting. If there was no communication about whether having sex with each other was just a hook up or was to start dating, then the onus is on both people for the lack of communication. Some people see sex as a fun way of hooking up and not meaning anything, but others don’t see it that way, so that’s where you have girls saying that they feel ghosted, because they expected due to their own approach to sex, that having sex meant something. Sex is fun but a serious act and can have physical and emotional affects on a person. It’s very different than buying someone a drink and then moving on. "
"Find some utility of tech, along with some other larger problem, a HUMAN problem, that requires solution.

I don't care about the kind of bullshit problems that Thalmic Labs try to solve, or RAVE, because they have some neeto-skeeto new tech that makes a teenage autist drip precum some nights while fantasizing over his future cali salary ""man maybe I can buy this someday.""

MY STRATEGY: ""How can I find ways of convincing people that my solution is the correct solution?"", ""How can I understand tech sufficiently that I can estimate costs and work-hours-to-solution in a repeatable, accurate, and therefore trustworthy way?"", ""How can I discern what is a founder high on his own fumes from a product that might actually be adopted in a widespread, even viral way?"", ""How can I align the needs of my employer with my personal needs as a human?"", ""How can I become my own employer so that I can continue to do whatever-the-fuck-I-want?""

Notice every single one of those questions, and their solutions, involves humanity, ie, people, including myself, often myself; and these problems are not well modelled, and sure as FUCK you will not answer ANY of these by grinding leetcode.  "
"I think I recall hearing about the curfews.  It may have been a good thing given some of the wild parties we had in V2.  It did get considerably emptier in the winter term due to the losses from the Christmas phone calls.

I always got along fine with Chuck from my recollection although I know he was not popular with some others.  I seem to recall always hearing rumours his job was on the line but good to hear that he survived.  IMHO it could not have been easy running a place like FH - the hype was huge when it was opened especially given the expense, and the crowds were massive but it was a multipurpose facility and so budgeting and staffing had to be a nightmare.  I recall he was married with children but I could be mixing him up.  I recall the limp but not the reason.  Yes to the mustache.

I could work bar, tables and bounce (I also worked at the Waterloo Inn as both a bouncer and bartender depending on the shift) so I was a good utility employee I suppose.  I always remember carrying the large trays of drinks (I could put 20-30 on the large trays which almost no once could do) and then navigating hordes of students with the tray over my head in one hand and my other pushing and navigating.  It was an art and a science at the same time.  Never spilled a tray even though once a girl came and ripped my shirt off me while I was carrying.

I really enjoyed my time at UW needless to say.  My problem was I kept on going offstream in co-op and so I went through almost my entire university never seeing the same people twice.  Virtually everybody I met in first year in my programs I never saw again.  The colldddd walk from V2 to the lecture halls is ingrained in memory."
"# The Federation of Students is having its General Meeting this Wednesday! Every University of Waterloo undergrad student gets a vote!!

# Date: October 24, 2018

**Time:** 12:00 pm

**Location:** SLC Great Hall

**Agenda**: [October 2018 Agenda (PDF)](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/2018_feds_agm_agenda.pdf)

**Agenda Supporting Documents:** [Motion 5a Proposed Bylaw Changes (PDF)](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/gm_bylaws_amendments.pdf)

**Stream Online:** [livestream  ](https://new.livestream.com/UWFeds)

Read the Agenda and supporting documents for the details; but the above diagram has some great summaries. Here's a few other clarifying or supplementary notes!

1. Councillor proxies would be assigned to Councillors,  These proxies would also be required to list an opinion/decision for every item.  (proxies are given blank to Feds and the first 30 would be immediately handed to Councillors from the same constituency as the proxier).  Also note: currently proxies cannot be used to vote for Directors or Auditor related items (at all).   [Board-Procedure-on-General-Meeting-Proxies](http://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Board-Procedure-on-General-Meeting-Proxies.pdf)

2. A change to the election for the FEDS Board of Directors: Director applications would be online and voted on by either a GM or Council of Delegates so anyone can participate and become a director, not just the people who bring their friends to the Winter GM.

3. Councillors, Execs, and Directors can be more easily removed from office. The new thresholds to call a recall referendum on a Councillor or Exec are 10% OR 500, whichever is fewer; and for removal of a Director, it’s 50%+1 at a GM or Council of Delegates.

4. Amending the bylaws would now require consultation with students before the items can go to a GM (with some minor exceptions for legal compliance)."

As far as I know the interview process is the same for both offices. You'll go through 3-4 steps before on-site which is probably where the only difference is.
Does GO Bus go to Toronto. I go to Square One every once in a while. You can only arrive so fast. 401 is sooo busy on Fridays. But they go as fast as they can.

"My friend got a response from kernel testing on Thursday, says he's doing the phone interview later today. 

I don't think they send out explicit rejections.  "
Ok interesting. I’ll definitely take a look. Although wouldn’t it be nice to have all these services like velocity and WatIMake in one convenient location?
Or because the voters don't benefit from orientation anymore even if they previously did. Out of self interest it makes sense for all voters to want to cut it.

"Same here, no idea what to expect for the midterm. If u wanna collab on the assignments, hit me up cuz apparently you can submit assignments as a group of two."
Shojaeddin Chenouri told his STAT443 section that he is teaching 440 next term. This is also under the assumption that there will only be one section next term
So do you think I should just write one and send it along with the rest of the required documents or would that come off as weird to the admissions department?
"There are tables with electrical outlets in the hallway on the 2nd floor DC above and to the left of the DC library, if you want to study there until it opens."

You can give yourself a buzz cut pretty easily if you have the stuff. You just need to make sure you only shave it in one direction otherwise it looks stupid. 
You gotta check if they offer that course in that term. Otherwise you’re just delaying yourself one year and have to take it again with the next years cohort
ahh ok. My opinion is 100% formed from looking at what my classmates use. It is very possible that what is normal in MC is not what is normal in popular media.

"Actually though. Thinking you're smart and have it all figured out is the m.o. of first years. There's an old adage that goes something like ""undergraduates know it all, masters question everything and PhDs know they know nothing at all"". I think it's part of the learning process - the more you know, the more you know of how much there is to know and how little your knowledge covers (or can cover) all of that.  "
"Ay same except I'm bad. There's a triangle between ""cheap"" ""good calorie/prote ratio"" and ""tasty"" when it comes to high protein food, and you can only choose two.


International news sells hard boiled eggs in gross little packages, beef sticks, and protein drinks. In the plaza, you could get a Harvey's build-a- bowl ($$$) I guess.


Most UW plaza foods are all loaded with tons of rice/bread/fries unfortunately."
"Girl!!! Attractiveness is 80% attitude and effort and 20% genetics. How you carry and groom yourself can make a huuuge difference in how attractive you are even if you don't wanna do things like gym/makeup/fancy skincare for the extra boost.

"I don't know to be honest, its been a decent amount of time. I just woke up today and facebook reminded me of a friendversary of some one that was really great friends with me but we got into a stupid argument and ruined things.

"depends how far you are along in your stream/sequence. if you're early on i'd say it isn't worth it since you have the chance for a better co-op like SV/Cali or whatever. if you're later in the cycle and you want to commit to tech consulting and have the possibility of moving to a different group, maybe go for it? it also assumes you actually like the work enough to want to go back for full time. a huge caveat.

"tfw when u see CS students having trouble in CS246 assignments as a Math student, but u got 90% avg on the assignments, and at the end couldnt get enough final marks to transfer into CS because the CS exams are simply testing ur writing/thinking speed and exam skills. That being said, don't feel bad if you cant get the code compiled in the assignments. You can still do well in exams if u understand the concepts."
"&gt; really frustrating for someone like me who is repulsed by the thought of casual sex.

And yet you're ""dating"", the purpose of which is almost always to have sex after 1-3 dates.

Your problem is quite simple. You're dating young guys who:

1. Don't want commitment. 

2. Can't communicate properly with women.

3. Probably can't approach women (you're approaching them).

4. Use dating apps to form superficial relationships based on physical attraction alone.

5. Watch a lot of porn, so their ideas about women and relationships are trash.

Perhaps I'm too quick to generalize but the way I see it is that there are two types of guys out there: fuckbois who pretend in different degrees to care about you, and men looking for a wife or at least a very serious relationship that has the potential to become a marriage. 

tldr date older guys with some morals and standards, or you'll just keep getting the same old thing."
"Well depends how far you want to go by ""original"", because that will vary based on the society and timeline. For example, Casanova was essentially a Victorian-era PUA, and he was just simply a natural ""ladies man"".

For more modern PUAs, it depends. To give a few examples, Roosh V was a total incel loser, and he used a scientific approach: he would make a hypothesis, he would field test the hypothesis (often resulting in him getting punched), then he would conclude whether it's true or false, and what to hypothesize next or change in his original hypothesis.

A second example could be Mystery. He was a magician who happened to notice how much women love magic tricks and ""mysterious"" men. So, he created a style of game based on that.

A final one is Neil Strauss. Also a loser, he was coached by Mystery to become an awesome PUA. Then, he went on a tangent and created his own style (I like to call it ""clown game"", because you're basically being a clown/peacock) based on what Mystery taught him.

Many more examples out there, but for the originals they all have unique stories. Some are naturals, some are self-taught, some were coached, and some just stumbled upon game."
"No. Undergrad got easier as time went on. The stuff I had to learn in first year that was hard still is hard. I still can't diagnolize a matrix or figure out how to quickly get the eigenvalues of a matrix (which I need for my courses now l m a o) and tbh i think I was better at it back then.

Tips for anyone in undergrad/my past self:

&gt;Free!! tutoring services for your courses exist at res and theres not that many people there so take advantage of it rather than spend all day and night being stuck on a single proof.

&gt;Profs really don't care if you're an annoying dumbass who bothers them 24/7 with 100000 emails. They are used to annoying dumbasses. They just facepalm after you leave and go ""smh kids these days"" but they don't judge you or anything. Send 100000 emails as soon as you don't get a concept. Ask to meet in person to go over the entire chapter you dont' get instead of spending days being stuck bc it's probably just a single thing thats holding you back.

&gt;Bad exams are just a thing that happens sometimes. It doesn't matter in the long run because your GPA is made out of too many things. Sure a bad mark in first year will maek your average look really bad that term because you only have like, 5 courses, but by 3rd or 4th year it's not gunna matter.

&gt; Set realistic goals and git gud at time management aka predicting how long you're gunna slack off when studying and adjust for that when making plans on when you're going to do assignments and study. Sure, a question might only take you 2 hours to do, but if you're also going to get distracted for 2 hours, account for that so you're not stressed out with omg i'm 10000 days behind on my schedule.

"As I was saying 8:30 - 5:30 is probably 40 hours a week. I think overtime for most private sector office jobs starts after 44 hours and for most construction jobs its 50 or 55 hours, and as far as I know employers can't demand that employees work overtime. But if they want you to work overtime and you don't it limits your future opportunities, so you should know what kind of lifestyle you want and go from there. "
"Hey thanks for the advice! I definitely agree that I should expand more on my projects considering I don't have any work experience &amp; I'll work on that soon.

"I've never seen these in all my years here, but Imo while that's still bad, I think it's a bit better because you might want to live with someone that you can relate to better because of cultural similarities.

"Jesus fucking christ the kids that go to this school... 

The smell of marijuana will not hurt you in any way. I agree, fuck all smoking on campus, and it's tough being a poor student with no private land, but you shouldn't be using or producing drugs in anyone's private property without their explicit permission.

"The only way to deal with it is to practice enough that you don't make these kinds of mistakes.

And you'll be severely disappointed if you think the pressure is even remotely lifted after university.

"Also ocs has been selling lots of “rotted” weed. Infuriating they can’t even spend time on QA and yet they want to pocket the tax money.

Read this:

The Liberal government has quietly written off a $2.6-billion auto-sector loan that was cobbled together to save Chrysler during the 2009 global economic meltdown.

The write-off, among the largest ever for a taxpayer-funded bailout, is buried in a volume of the 2018 Public Accounts of Canada, tabled in Parliament on Friday.

The reference contains no explanation for the write-off, identifying neither the business that received the loan nor the sector of the economy.

Y’all needa grow a pair of eyes and balls"
"I don't know about that. I voted for Scheer instead of Bernier solely because of the socon/pro-life angle. Whereas now Bernier is talking about ""Canadian roots and identity"". He fucked up by waiting to say those things. Plenty of conservatives are waiting for a legitimate leader like that.

Besides, I figured their economic policies were more or less the same other than the supply management thing. And I don't have strong opposition to that anyway, since it keeps out low-quality American products full of hormones and whatnot.

And they both seemed kind of neutral about most social issues, not siding with the far left but also not going to change the status quo. 

"
"What are you putting in your curry? Try loading it up with veggies and lentils to help get more from it. 

Another way to uptake my veggie intake is by cutting up veggies (carrots, celery, cauliflower) small and throwing them into pasta sauce. 

I don't believe there's anything wrong with eating a grain heavy diet but there are easy ways to add in more veg and proteins (even plant based proteins are great).

Additionally if you're dropping weight quickly it might be advisable to go to the doctor just to make sure everything is alright. Not to scare you but my friend went through something similar to you in undergrad and it turned out she had undiagnosed diabetes. "
"I agree we need a solution here. 

One of the challenges is that the intersection doesn't meet the current warrant system for traffic signals -- and unwarranted interventions can sometimes raise the risk of other forms of collisions and can increase legal liability for not following policy based on ""sound traffic engineering"" \[even if that sound engineering is a 1950s auto-centric standard\].

That said, I believe we need a shift in policy that gives more priority to pedestrians, which would get us to see this intersection differently (among a few others I know need work across the city). I've signaled to staff that I'm looking for solutions in this direction as we update our transportation master plan so that we can get where we want to go on a sound legal liability footing. That update should get going once the new Council is seated, as I understand staff have got the consulting resources lined up.

However, I do feel that your pitch, including what's on your website, is not that relevant to the audience here. Most of the students are only going to be here for a couple of years, so if I were you I'd really focus on what's going to impact their life most.

Meanwhile, I guess I'd be happy to have someone to represent millennial' voice and interest in the council, but your platform and proposals are... well, a bit mundane. Those ideas are similar to what the other candidates in their 40\~50s would say, and in my humble view, they're not addressing what young people need most, e.g. rising housing price and rental, less affordable living, influxing high tech industry vs. local traditional business, kids' safety."
"&gt; are extra mean to them just because they're Asian. That's all.

About 55% of internationals are from China.

When some people (of all race, cultural background, etc.) get aggressive towards them that's usually because of a long string of irritating experiences related to:

- Reserving spots in crowded classrooms

- Talking/Laughing in class

- Smoking at building entrances

- More broadly: sticking with each other and not blending in with locals (of all races)

And if we are being honest, yes that's behavior that is more prevalent among international students from China.

However, I can assure you that if you were to magically replace all the international student from China with people from France. Locals would be complaining about them for these reasons:

- Reserving spots in crowded classrooms

- Talking/Laughing in class

- Smoking at building entrances

- More broadly: sticking with each other and not blending in with locals (of all races)

In other words, I think it has nothing to do with the fact that they are from China. If anything, people in Ontario are most well inclined to Chinese people than they are towards francophones because of the Quebec stuff.

Chinese internationals exhibit this string of behavior because they are a large enough group that they don't feel like they need to integrate. They take the path of least resistance just like any other out-group would do. There is nothing unique or intrinsically Chinese in what they do. And the complaints aren't about specific attributes of Chinese culture either.

Chinese internationals do what a large enough foreign group of young people do when they are dropped in a cultural context that's not theirs. "
"So, going into this co-op, I really wanted to try this area of the business out. So I went in wanting to do well and learn alot -- which I am and super happy about. Being able to actually contribute to the team's daily tasks is important to me, considering I never did anything of quite an impact in my co-ops before.


I think my pressures of being perfect again, stem from how much everyone on my team brings up the previous co-op and how he was in charge of xyz, or that he would be so technical and very good at the work he did. So yes, I guess my previous co-ops were not a challenge at all, but also I feel like I don't fit in well with the current group either as there are many things I'm still not sure how they link.

As for the learning process, trust me in that I'm constantly typing and writing down EVERY instruction I need when I'm told to do things. I'm a visual person, not audio, so I need things written down to rememeber while I ask for questions too. It's probably why I also have issues taking in information because there's still a lot of vocabulary I'm not 100% clear on. I'm always asking for clarification and questions when I get stuck, but even then, I alway think,...would the last co-op be having as many stupid questions as I'm having?


I understand failing is normal, but again, I have a hunch that I'm not as ""cool"" or ""social"" or smart as the last co-op whom they all STILL reminisce about. My manager did say he was glad to see how well I do at listening and taking feedback and improving because I did improve compared to my first two weeks here. It's just I still feel like they have this feeling that they don't like me, and it makes me hate going to work.  "

If you take a class outside of regular school terms, you better have a great reason (i.e you wanted to take extra courses during the school term but the school wouldn't let you have all of them -or something like that-) which would mean for Ont. students youd have to have done 5-6 courses per term in gr11/12 (because thats what they can see) and then you take any core courses that cant fit in the summer.

"THE ARTICLE LINKS TO [THIS ARTICLE](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-university-of-waterloo-in-battle-with-on-campus-startup-over-clean/):

&gt; According to school policy, on-campus researchers retain full rights to their IP, not UW – except when outside organizations underwrite the research.

&gt; In those cases, IP rights are negotiated between UW and the sponsor. This has been a lucrative source of funding, providing $231.3-million to UW for sponsored research in the past five years.

&gt; Under the JCESR deal that underwrote Dr. Nazar’s lab, UW was to own any IP resulting from that funding – but the U.S. agency retained the right to license it. A few weeks before the Velocity competition, a JCESR official told them he believed their invention was indeed funded by the agency.

&gt; If so, that meant the invention belonged to UW and JCESR retained the licensing rights.

ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS?"
"They are a foreign cultural element in our school which makes no part to ingratiate itself with the surrounding cultural matrix. 

1. They are culturally different. That would be fine if it weren't for the fact that 
2. They don't interact with us. It's not a racial issue either, they don't talk to CBC's much either.
3. They are a different class from the majority of UWaterloo students. Most UWaterloo students are lower-&gt;upper middle class. These guys are clearly upper class, wearing gaudy designer brands all the time, driving flashy super cars or upper market sedans. 

That makes at least 3 aspects upon which they are different from the average student here. Culture, interaction and class.

What does this mean? They are different. And they are openly different. There is no chance for understanding because they don't bother. And so whenever we feel slighted by their behavior, there is no chance for reconciliation."
"Would actually like to hear someone from Feds respond to this. and aren't we as a university supposed to have an ombudsman to deal with exactly this?

I hope OP submits this to cbc and other news outlets - I would love to get CECA shit on from the media so that they can actually improve, because they literally keep failing at their (one) fucking job? I hope somebody better than me at this can start a conversation about this but I honestly expect it to get stifled under the guise ""You threatened CECA and we are a bunch of wimps so you will get kicked out of school"""
"I was exec for the poker club last term, and a frequent attender in the previous winter term, and I enjoyed it a lot then. I only went once this term and was fairly off-put with what I experienced. 

Firstly, there was no beginner tables for people who are new to the game. This causes a problem as people who only know the basic actions without any understanding of how to play well, will be put on the tables with people who play at very high levels of skill. This in itself isn't a massive issue, it could be a good way to learn, but a lot of skilled players were milking the beginners for every chip they had, causing them to pay the buy-in fee or leave the club. 

What I witnessed was one current exec and one skilled player at my table not only doing this, but being very condescending towards the bad plays made by the beginners. 

As a reminder to current execs, this is not 'Poker Club' but 'Poker **Studies** Club' for a reason. A culture of teaching and learning should be evident to everyone who walks in.

Second thing, which is far more minor, what is with the chip values? 14k stacks feels like an odd number, and the values of the chips themselves is kinda confusing.

"&gt; ...hearing about tech coops in the valley

Well its not like i literally expected  that by going into my program id get a tech job, not what i was looking for anyways but i meant in general the prestige of coop employers such as SV based companies. It is seemingly advertised in a way imo like UW has the best employers in all fields hiring and theres infinite oppurtu ity for everyone when there really isnt

&gt;  did you seriously not look at the kind of jobs people in your program actually get?

How? UW only posts a highlight reel of jobs for each program when you look under the examples of coops, and how was i to reach out to all the students in my program asking qhat kinds of coops they got when the program doesnt have a reddit presence (plus im not a pest like faraz asking questions)

Why are you attacking me tho? I just threw something in for OP and you really out here trying to take the piss for me being a nervous grade 12 student trying to make an important decision. Mistakes are made and people be mislead. I was super excited to go to UW and i felt that coop was the one edge it had over the other schools (which UW really pushes for all faculties) so i bought into it. I reviewed all the info provided about coop for my program like you suggested i shouldve done. But at the end of the day WW simply did not offer competitive positions for my program. So i dipped UW. 

Tldr: coops a scam for here non stem yeehaw"

The trick is to figure out what information you need to be able to apply a relevant formula, and use it. It's all quintessentially reading carefully, line questions and basic chemistry trivia

"This is around the right average for 273. You either take a 30% now or you take it on the final. To be honest, I don't support profs making some of the finance courses seem impossibly difficult. To be fair, I have graduated already with a solid foundation in finance, if you let me write your exam right now, I'll be at the bottom tier too. A lot of people, just because they get a low mark in finance, think that finance is ""Too hard"" for them and it's only for smart people. That's definitely not true at all. These profs really turning away a lot of good talents we have. Just because it's ""hard"", doesn't make you a good prof and make the classes you teach ""prestigious""."
"wtf??????

I seriously think I should just drop out of this course 

(*Holds back tears*) Objectively speaking, the exam felt like it was totally out to get students by testing small things not mentioned on slides and trivial stuff that most people would overlook. It was not really meant to comprehensively test someone's understanding of the content. I hate how super poorly designed this course is and how big of a disappointment it is, considering how interesting a well made course on cybersecurity could potentially be. 

This course deserves as bad a reputation as CS 348, just that it is not that infamous because it's an optional elective.

The 5-bedroom era was not a good one. The 2012 Northdale Plan, which we worked with students and the community on in my first 18 months in office, was partly in response to what some termed a 'warehousing' of students in 5-bed units in, often, ugly buildings. One of the changes of the new plan was to remove the unintended incentives in zoning to building those -- density was changed to per bedroom from per unit, parking (which costs considerable space and money to build) was also changed to per bedroom from per unit. We had an incentive program ready to help industry make the shift, but they shifted on their own. New builds that started post-Northdale Plan averaged less than 2 beds/unit. \[More on the plan at [http://waterloo.ca/northdale](http://waterloo.ca/northdale). I also did an RA-ship during my master's looking at 30 years of planning and student housing in Waterloo -- we'll be published soon in the Journal of International Planning Studies, but no link yet\]"

"Haven't taken 121 (so take what I say with a grain of salt) but I've taken a couple of the second year phys major courses.

Exams were somewhere in between, but a bit more leaning towards the assignments with more problem solving type problems. "

You might think its shitty but thats just your perspective. Saying a race or a group of people is bad just because they don't believe the same things you do is by definition racist."
"Many co-ops are boring both inside and out of the university. The positions in UW are fairly relaxed and pay exactly the average which are both not bad things.

And a physical piano is definitely necessary--there are piano rooms in V1 that you can book for that sort of thing, I think. Buying them is significantly more expensive, anything less than $500 is probably more harm than good (will either be less than 88 keys, or won't be weighted which will make playing on a real piano feel _very_ weird)"
"I’m an upper year BME

Neuro is very research based, so there’s not much exposure to it in undergrad (especially first year). BME isn’t bad for neuro but all those electives are in fourth year. If you’re not enjoying design or other core BME classes, then maybe consider the switch. BME is mech based for first year, but by upper years there’s more programming/electrical classes to balance them out.

I’m not sure CS is better for neuro, since it’s mostly theoretical computer science with limited overlap with neuro. If you’d rather have a stronger programming background or want more freedom with courses, then CS is absolutely better.

PM me if you want :)"
"This isn't so much of an excuse but more of an explanation for something I know I shouldn't do but find myself doing anyway:

When I lived in res, the few Chinese people who lived there (whether international or chinese immigrants to Canada) were fairly cliqueish and didnt tend to associate with anyone else. Originally, I thought it was just because they were more comfortable socializing in their native language, but later on, one of my bilingual friends said it was actually because they didnt like the rest of us (those of us who weren't chinese). One of them told me I was too dumb to do CS because I wasn't asian. I asked my other international friends about it, and they said the chinese students only talked initially because they looked chinese, but stopped when they realized they weren't. 

I know not all chinese people are like this, so I try not to generalize, but sometimes an experience leaves you just sour enough"
"- I would hesitate to use two levels of bullet points. It makes your resume seem weirdly aligned. For your awards I would just write the names out in their own line with no bullet points and then have the explanation below as a bullet point
- In your professional summary you start two points with ""Excellent"" and two points with ""strong"". Try to make each point unique and use different words. It will make your resume sound less bland.
- Typos in your first work experience bullet points: ""which aim to facilitate the acquisition"" should be ""aims"". ""by analyzed the industry"" should be ""by analyzing the industry""
- The first bullet point of your work experience is too long. You've crammed many things into one. It is easier to take in and read if it is separated into individual bullet points. Furthermore, which tools did you use here to accomplish your tasks? Would be worth noting
- What tools or software did you use to analyze key human capital and metrics?
- Are there any technical details about the training you provided on the new mobile applications? Anything you can name drop here?
- Should be ""senior staff"" vs. ""senior staffs""
- ""Contacted more than 60 potential and existing clients...""  What was the end result of it? Why is it worth mentioning?
- What platforms and tools did you use to promote the study abroad workshops?
""Provided study abroad consulting services"". You've already mentioned the studying abroad part in the bullet point above so I would just stick with ""provided consulting services""
- You are missing an education section. If you don't want to add a whole section atleast write under your name what program, university, and year you're in. 
- For your first award try to explain what tasks you completed at that competition/event. Be more explicit about what you accomplished

Overall it is well formatted, however seems heavily focused towards banking jobs. If this is what you're going for then great, otherwise try to add skills that show expertise in other fields/tasks.

"I feel you

My Grade 9/10/11 English marks were 88/82/84. Coming from a school falling in the average zone of the now famous list. So not utter dogshit, but probably not for enough to get into Loo. Then in Grade 12 I just had a teacher who really appreciated my style, I think. See, I'm really into quotes, history, and unusual humor. When I wrote essays they always had some weird slant. I was really non-serious as a high schooler so my philosophy was that I'd rather lose marks in an entertaining way than write mechanical shit. Didn't always go over well...but through some ungodly miracle I pulled a 93 in Grade 12 and got in, right at the mark cutoff. God fucking bless. "
Isn't yellow fever disingenuous and even racist to use in reference to couples where an asian female exists to both the male and the female involved? I feel like its kind of a blanket term these days and it kind of discredits the majority of asian girls in relationships whos partner actually sees them as a person vs the minority of those women who might be in a relationship based off of their partners fetish? Like it kind of reduces the public to look at an xMAF couple and be almost sorry for the girl and jump to the assumption her only redeeming quality for their partner is her race. Which in that case would mean that anti-yellow fever people become racist themselves?
"The City Clerk has made it easier than ever for students to vote this year.

"The first rule of advertising is to constantly say you are the opposite of your flaws.

UW says they're innovative. They're not that great. They're about as innovative as a large University should be... Velocity is cool for CS kids but I have yet to hear of a startup I actually give a shit about in the slightest. There's nothing ""innovative"" going on in courses with no projects. And when a project is assigned, everyone is just cheating on it anyway."
"I see your point, and it makes sense. when I first came to this school I was in a program that I, as well as my friends and family, thought I was born for, but soon after it started I knew it wasn't for me, so I began to look for another program to transfer into. the idea that I didn't need to major in the program that I started in was very foreign to me, to the point where I was relieved when I decided to try to transfer, but this didn't help my depression at all. if anything it got worse, as now I was dealing with the weight of the idea that I didn't switch into the right program, and that I would be switching again and again, and that's assuming I was even going to get into the program. it doesn't really matter what situation you're in, people always seem to find a way to feel the same as they did before the situation changed. after a very rough end of last year for me, I decided to take a break from school, and live at home again for a bit. I thought that this would help things, considering a lot of my stress was caused by school, but it never got better, what happened was that I redirected the cause for my sadness to other things- crippling anxiety, loneliness etc,. the point is that something like depression never has an easy fix, there isn't one thing someone could do to get rid of it, it seems to follow you around wherever you go. I understand where you're coming from saying to drop out, but it's never that simple"
"If Canada is unable to grow and have a strong ""base"" of a population pyramid, we will quickly become overwhelmed with the welfare costs of our aging citizens. I know governments can just continue to run deficits forever, but as history plays out, on the macro scale this is how empires collapse. Back to immigration:

\-Anyone without a substantial criminal history can apply at a port of entry for a ""Dreamer"" visa. Must have $10,000 CAD per individual in funds coming to Canada with them. Visa allows you to work for any employer, visa valid for 6 years. You do not have access to typical social safety net until after 2 years of full time work. Yes, you will go hungry if you don't work. This is essentially an open border policy.

\-After 5 years on a Dreamer visa without any substantial criminal history, you may apply for permanent residency. Must demonstrate proficiency in one of the two official languages. You must have worked full time for at least 4 out of the 5 years, allowances are made for life events: disability, etc.

  
\-After a combined 8 years on Dreamer visa + Permanent residency, without any substantial criminal history, you may apply for citizenship. Previous citizenship(s) must be forfeited, no dual,tri, etc.  


We need to have open immigration but at the same time realize there is a real cost with any new individual. Open immigration use to work really well because there was no social safety net. You don't work, you starve. Harsh, but true. Now we have a healthy dose of social programs - these programs do not come free. Open immigration is still a great idea, but if we want to maintain our social programs we need to have assurances that they will be paid for."

Second half was talking about your coding challenge and just asking some questions."
"Which a protest wasn't capable of doing in the first place. Actions such as, say, pulling a fire alarm, are already illegal and don't need some additional policy with threats of cutting funding. Given the funding threats, a school is more likely to err on the side of caution and simply disallow a protest.

Consider the wording of the policy implies a university refusing to host an anti-vaxxer could suffer funding cuts."
"Yeah, I think losing Laurier co-op isn't the end of the world for CS students, and it does sound like regular CS is a far better fit.

"I don't know the OP or the person who wrote the post, but professors can certainly be empathetic and caring, even if there's nothing they can do about it. I imagine the OP wouldn't have felt so wronged had Strickland offered her condolences, explained the death certificate requirement, and offered to accommodate in any way that she can, as well as reminded them of the resources available to cope with grief. Maybe she did and the OP still didn't feel like it was enough.

"I mean if you actually wash you’re hands correctly you shouldn’t have to worry about touching the handle to flush, there’s nothing wrong with that.

And I think you are really overestimating the amount of pathogens that linger in the air and underestimating your immune system.

Edit: I mean if there were really that many pathogens lingering in the air for and extended time you would probably have a higher chance of getting sick from breathing them in, rather than them contaminating your hands. By your own logic.  Since this doesn’t really happen I think my point proves itself.

Edit2: also with the tp thing, that’s a given. Everyone should be using enough so it doesn’t physically get on you. However you never know what kind of particulates are going to be picked up so you should wash your hands anyway. It’s super disgusting imo.

"Not great.  I think it was the fact that it was 10% and in a matter of seconds, some people lost it and others gained it.  When you realize tht your answer that you thought was right and the answer most of the students got right were different it makes you feel like damn everyone knew about this but me.  I mean you were there so you know how loud it was when V.K said the answer.  Tbh I’m not even mad or jealous of the students who got it right, they gained 10% and they were happy which they should be, because I know for sure as hell I would be. 

I’m mad at the fact that a 10% quiz  had one fucking question.  Like we all know V.K has been putting the quiz off and finally he knew he had to give the quiz today so he wrote some bullshit ass question.  Like the quiz is supposed to represent QUESTIONS (plural)  that we learned in class, that was the whole POINT OF THE QUIZ.  to make sure people came to his boring ass class.  But I guess that question was representative of what we did In class because we did. NOTHING IN THAT STUPID ASS CLASS.  The more I think about this the more I start getting minor aneurysms. 

So much salt in the air i might as well be breathing salt.  "
"To be fair, it is the case that there are a lot of first years who can be very cocky (especially in programs like SE, CS, ECE, etc. that have crazy high admissions averages). A lot of people come in to university with an attitude of ""School is easy! I can get 90's without trying! I'm the best at math/programming/etc. !"" and then get crushed when they do poorly on midterms/finals, or even fail a course.  And sometimes people do need to do poorly to realize that they aren't top shit and can learn from other people in their program.  


I'm definitely not saying it's good to crush first years dreams. I've always had my parents breathing down my neck and telling my grades were the most important thing and I shouldn't be ""completely wasting \[their\] money."" I got a 60 in ECE 106 last term and I still won't here the end of it. So I'm definitely not advocating for destroying the self confidence of 18 year olds.  


That being said, university is a (much needed) wake up call for some people. And yes, of course it's possible to get a 90+ average, but it is certainly not as easy as it was in high school. It requires a lot of time and effort (in general), and a lot of people who complain about courses on reddit and make these comments got this wake up call (whether they needed it or not). The end result is a lot of bitterness towards first years who are keen to do well.  


Regardless, the average in most first year university courses is in the 70's, so it's best to prepare incoming firsties for the probable grade drop. It should probably come with a caveat though, saying it's possible to do well given the time and effort (and obviously shouldn't be said with the tone you mentioned)."

"took both, 349 easier by a country mile. i personally found 456 incredibly dry with too much memorization. a lot of 456 is just reimplementing already solved problems, which i guess is good to know but i didnt care for it at all. 349 is pretty brainless, but i will say the project (in my term we had to code a game in java) was actually a fair bit of work. not difficult work per se, just tedious and a bit of a time sink."

"Some of my program I actually enjoy, but the majority of it I find to be a real drag. Often times I end up super depressed and weighed down by stress and anxiety because I occasionally do poorly despite trying my best to do well(See ECE 240). What usually makes the work worth it imo is the co-op terms where I end up doing things that I usually at least somewhat enjoy despite my poor programming capabilities.  


I've considered switching out before but realized that it's not worth it anymore, especially considering how deep in the pit I already am, which is the main reason why I continue to stick with it until I graduate.

"Okay I'm not going to lie to you, they're stretched pretty thin. If you want ongoing counseling you might be on the waitlist for a very long time. I was on the list for an entire year before getting a call. However, please don't let that prevent you from going anyway. Even going for one or two appointments will likely help a ton, and when you do get in they don't discriminate. The counselors there are fantastic - one of the people who does the one-off appointments is named Laura and she's amazing, you can try going to her. 

They have walk-in counseling on Wednesdays and Thursdays you just have to go early in the morning to get a spot. When you do go though, they would never make you feel like you're not bad ""enough."" There's also MATES which is peer counseling which I haven't used yet myself but I hear its fantastic. They aren't registered social workers or counselors but students who are trained to comfort people and help them out. 

They really do try their hardest to help everyone, and don't forget: YOU MATTER. The university's JOB is to help you succeed. I've been exactly where you are and I'm doing so much better now, but I would NOT be where I am without counseling. 

If you do try out campus counseling and you can't seem to get enough resources there, I suggest checking out Delton Glebe counseling near WLU. You can see masters students for super cheap (25 bucks a session) without insurance compared to other therapists in town. 

Feel free to PM me too; I'm in my 4th year here and have had chronic anxiety my entire life, and have dealt with campus counseling since my first year. I also work within the university so part of my job is to provide resources to students :)"
"it's only been a couple weeks of the term, but if it could help you give some advice i'll try to give some sort of an outline of how i spend my time. 

cs245 assignments are due on wednesday so i usually spend my weekend doing that, and i can always do like most of the assignment myself but need help for the few hard questions. the other things i might do on the weekends are some chill stuff like reviewing/catching up on stat230/math239 notes, but generally i try and use the weekend as my break.I also usually spend my time between my morning classes and afternoon classes to do stats practice, and one night a day or two before the midterm/test also if we have one. and then that leaves the rest of my evenings to be spent for cs246. usually from like 7/8pm - 2am im just doing cs, but i always don't get much done. like at most 1 question per 5 hour or so session. it's hard for me to produce code without getting help from others so i always work with others. i definitely find myself relying on others too much, and perhaps thats why i am terribly inefficient when it comes to cs246. idk how to solve this though as i spend a solid amount of my time reviewing my cs246 notes on my own, but when it comes to assignment questions I can hardly ever put any code out when i try doing it myself.   


now with all that and prepping for interviews, and catching up on lectures i missed/didnt understand i don't really leave myself enough time to do any math239. not sure how to really change my schedule to fit it in, cause I'm pretty much just doing work all day every day, but still struggling to keep up. i can definitely see that my learning strategies might need to be improved, but not sure how"

3. It's a shitty depressing place, where most people are shallow and chase shallow goals like getting co-ops at ""prestigious"" companies without any real plan in life. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your time here and make genuine friends. It's just a school where people are extremely career focused, nothing that amazingly great.

4. No one can answer this one for you accurately as it depends on you more than anything else. If you are actually smart, the Waterloo curriculum is a breeze. For co-op you apply to a bunch of openings the term before your work term on WaterlooWorks, wait for employers to select you for interviews, go for interviews, and get an offer, or a rank. You then rank your offers/ranks. You can take any offer you got, but if you don't have an offer you can still get a job if you are ranked and no one else wanted the job."
"The irony of this is that Council went to painstaking lengths to make the policy more encompassing of general discrimination and less about just the BDS movement specifically. You can read the new Counter-Discrimination, [Policy 48](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/sc_policies_september_2018.docx.pdf) here.

The part this article totally ignores is that Council went out of its way to remove any punishments for clubs that might be in violation of the policy (eg. the SFPR club which is complaining about this policy). We felt that Free Expression (see corporate policy 21) for clubs and societies takes precedence to Federation stances. 

The other issue this article misses is that Council -- and Feds generally -- is bound to the referendum results. That's because when the referendum was held our _then bylaws_ said referendums that pass above a certain threshold are binding on the corporation if ratified. A General Meeting ratified the referendum, so its decision is binding on Council. Council explicitly allowed future referenda on this issue, but just said it wouldn't ratify it without overturning the rules (procedurally this is because 1 referendum to undo another is the same as a motion to rescind a previous decision in Robert's Rules of Order which is the Feds parliamentary authority).

EDIT: By ""Council allowing"" referenda, I mean that the prior policy prohibited Feds from holding referenda on BDS."
"&gt; Wow, you've got it all figured out, don't you?

p much.  buy my forthcoming book.

&gt; I just find it rude how

It is true, it is rude.  My point was it should not be surprising.  Absolutely no recruiter whatsoever has your best interests at heart.  Follow the money, or, as I say when dealing with human problems, and getting hired or being a recruiter is a human problem, follow the motivation.

The motivation of the recruiter is simply to get any body to sign a contract and work past a 90 days probation (variants on individual cases obviously vary).  There is absolutely nothing in this case that says anything about your interests, wants, needs, expectations - s/he just needs to sell you a job for 90 days and disappear.  

Most recruiters have no idea what they're even talking about.  For shits and giggles, when I get recruiters contacting me, I look them up on LinkedIN.  Most of them can't possibly have the foggiest idea what they're trying to recruit me for, and some have even less experience at work and life in general than I do, so, how are they qualified to ""recruit"" me?  They know fuck all!  They're salespeople, working on commission, and you should expect to be treated that way if you bother to interact with them.

&gt; That doesn't mean I can't be upset about it though, like jesus c'mon man.

Yeah you're right and I was mean to you.  So, take this advice:

A recruiter is not a hiring manager.  You don't need to be nice to this person, and they certainly won't be nice to you as soon as they realize there is a better commercial opportunity for them (ie. not you?  ghost).  So, recognize this is a transactional relationship much like hiring a prostitute.  In this case, you are the prostitute.  You're selling your work to a broker, who doesn't give a fuck about you except what you're worth in their trade.  They often won't tell you about that trade, because that limits their power, you could deal with the john directly in that case, and wouldn't need the pimp/recruiter. So step one, find out about the trade as much as possible without regards for pissing off the recruiter.  The recruiter will stick around you so long as they think you can get hired.

1.  Ask the recruiter ""what is the company?""  - they often don't tell you this. Ask them!  they'll probably tell you if you ask, if they don't, fuck them 100% ghost time.  You'll also probably find out it's not a great company, which is why they have to hire a recruiter, because they can't attract people by their own nature.

2.  Ask the recruiter straight up before anything else ""What does this job pay?"" - they KNOW and you don't have to play normal diplomacy with this person because they are not the hiring manager.  More on this in a bit.  

3.  You can be as bitchy and salty and direct and indifferent to that recruitment person, (ah well within limits), because at the end of the day that recruiter is gonna package up your profile, and write up a blurb about you along with a few other suckers, and make you look fan-fucking-tastic, to whatever sucker hiring manager thought it would be a good idea to use a recruiter.  This should change your strategy a few ways.:

3.1  Throw out honesty.  If you looked them up on linkedin you know that they went to conestoga college 15 years ago (or 4 months ago, more likely) and have 0% idea what the fuck it actually is you do for a living.  Drop some buzzwords when they ask you their gating questions, like ""do you know XYZ?"" - just say YES.  Tell me about a time when you did (this is a behavioural question, trickier to evaluate, doesn't fit neatly into a checkbox, thus less likely to be asked, think about what this recruiter will ""understand"" about what you say, s/he will make some point notes in a box, which will be in turn read by a hiring manager later (or summarized by the recruiter)   So the strategy here is just think of any important accomplishment (or sounding accomplishment) and tell the recruiter that, s/he will make note of it, not understand exactly if it's related to the work or not, and the eventual hiring manager will be interested and assume the missing details are the fault of the idiot recruiter (the hiring manager already knows the recruiter is an idiot).  tl;dr feel free to just MAKE SHIT UP if it sounds good, because the recruiter can't tell the difference and the hiring manager can't really trust that anything that ends up on his plate is accurate

If the wage and the company are good enough for you (ie you're desperate, many people are) then play up to the recruiter that you definitely plan to stay there for a long period and just say whatever you need to say to make it sounds like ""wow this job really fits into my long term plans"" (however DO NOT SAY ""this job really fits into my long term plans"" - every cuck will say that.  Instead let the idiot connect the dots and think their idea is their own, by saying things like ""yeah my brother lives in Tilsonburg and I'd like to live with him"" or ""my dad also works in injection molding and I really respect him"" or ""I think it's important to build fundamentals in code so a few years working on a project like this really resonates with me"" - this paints a picture of first derivate motivation which a recruiter will accept as authentic even if it's complete BS, and make conclusions about you and more importantly their own commission on the matter - they assume (ie, don't even consider that...) you are not clever enough to make up this sort of lie) or ""because this assures the hiring manager you will not quit within the 90 days and therefore s/he'll get her commission and therefore s/he'll big you up on her presentation to the hiring team.

if necessary lie lie lie lie lie lie lie (or as I like to encourage, imagine imagine imagine imagine) "

3. Onezo (brown sugar milk tea) - v close, pretty $$$, I like their flavoured tapioca, though it takes forever to get your order ready
4. ShareTea (okinawa milk tea, coffee creama) - vvv close (like 30 sec from E6), very $$$, really like the flavours and mini tapioca
5. Pres(t)oTea (mango drinks, some flower milk tea that started with a t) - 10 min walk away, nice place to sit and talk, nothing too special
6. Coco's (3 guys) - pretty close, normal prices with really good priced monthly drinks, but not a fan anymore (honestly I think I just went here way too often one term and can never return)
7. Campus Bubble (nothing) - it's just bad, hard tapioca, powdery flavours, also not really close since I'm in engineering but o well

"As the publicly crucified physicist says in his slides, the only reason we need to talk about it is because people are pushing through policies which are based on the assumption that men and women are (or should be) the same. He proposes that the female to male ratio can be predicted as follows:
Nf/Nm = interest x ability +/-= 1/4 x (accounting for males 15% greater distribution in IQ). And in the next slide he posted a meme suggesting that the approach progressives are taking is working against their supposed end goal (and perhaps that could explain the reverse correlation between gender equity index and % women in stem). 

He didn't deny that there could be societal influences playing a role, he suggested that some of it could be inherent and then suggested that progressives could be the societal problem. That's why he's being crucified.

Personally, I think that the only reason we're able to have this conversation is because technology has made strength relatively unimportant, has reduced infant mortality which means women don't need to have 5 or 6 kids to have 2 or 3 survive to adulthood, etc. If we were to lose most of our technology and be forced to revert to an agricultural society (without tractors or anything like that) with high infant mortality I am fairly certain that economic gender roles would once again become much more rigid. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do things different now, we probably should to at least some extent, but we shouldn't judge history using today's situation. "

It's like the ""it's okay to be white"" thing, its so effective because it is true and yet the current media/political/social environment requires white people to not reproduce and to be ashamed rather than proud of their heritage. Mass migration has become a lucrative business for a small group of people, and anything that threatens to undermine that profit makes this group lash out with smears whose goal is to destroy cultures and leave a void that can be filled with their empty purposeless validation-seeking degenerate lifestyle. "
"Washing your hands is still useful. The amount of airborne particulates and pathogens is still going to be smaller than what is currently on your hands. BUT, (and this is a big one) you NEED to dry your hands fully before touching anything else. The goal is to reduce your immune system load to the point where it isn't overwhelmed and you don't become sick. 

Ever swim in a lake where they say not to swim after a heavy rain? I do and I've never gotten sick from it. You know why? I don't drink the water or at least don't swallow large amounts of it. Your strategy of not washing hands is analogous to me gulping in the dirty lake water on purpose because ""I'll get sick anyway""."

Do you remember how long it took for that to happen? I'm semi-relying on my WatCard as a bus pass and I'm trying to decide when to cut my losses and just buy the new card.
"Hmm mine has updated to two, first one titled Software Engineer Intern and another ending with University of Waterloo. The status I was referring to was for the first one."
"How is ""strong preference for Asians"" distinct from ""Asian-ness is an important criterion for selecting a partner""? To me it sounds like two ways of saying the same thing."

I was hugging my friend in lecture (after it was over) and then I started to pick him up and he kept telling me to put him down so I did. Then I picked up my other friend.
I'm assuming that the message-only interview would be an offer? I don't know if they'll go out their way to specifically give you that on WaterlooWorks just to reject you.
Idk if I haven’t been paying attention or something but I swear there weren’t these many clueless children asking these god awful questions in previous admission cycle
"I’ll have to talk to exchange advisors about how I should rank them, since HKU is listed as being fairly difficult to get into. I could probably just rank it 1 and hope "
Lol same.. I stopped being friends with most of my old ones cause they were a obnoxious backstabbing assholes. Technically I could still have friends but I’d rather not 
Normally single question quizzes are calculation or explain questions though. I in my entire degree never had a 1 question “either you know this or you don’t” quiz. 
"Play spooky video games? That's what I'm gonna do (that's a lie, DMC 4 isn't that spooky). Dunno if you wanted something more legit, like summoning skeletons or something "
"Really appreciate them staying way past their designated hours (drop in hours were supposed tk end at 5, stayed there until 9 and the ISAs were still answering questions)."
"Same as soft eng, leetcode style algorithm questions. My interviews didn't have any theory. Depending on the difficulty of the question they'll probably go through 1 or 2."
Thats a very good answer. I can tell your very passionate and that is really admirable. We really do need more people like you.  I wish you the best of luck going forward.
"What am I look at? Is it an old photo of DP (missing quite a few floors and have drive way in front), or is it a similar building elsewhere, or is it a conceptual drawing?"
"What is this the Chunin exams? If I can't get into CS co-op then I'm going to take over admissions once I invade the CS co-op cohort. On second thought, call me Orochimaru"
"Yes, DO NOT UPSET CECA. They have the ability to punish you by blocking you from WaterlooWorks for future co-op terms/job searches if they feel you violated their policies"
"Yes, you can, you just need to figure out what your Access ID, group number, and member ID are. I called them and they gave them to me and I was able to log in with that. "

"Definitely worth legal clarity for certain, but before signing something into policy there should be serious student consultation if it's going to affect them substantially. That has not occurred and just generally the Class G mechanism for policy approval is ridiculous.

As for the language, it has always been in the policy! I don't know what issues it's caused thus far, but the standard is pretty ridiculous in my opinion."
"Find a positive way to appreciate this. In physics, for later courses and as a student of the field, it is exceptionally beneficial to build a good intuition for derivations and the method of logic that entails such results. Epp does a wonderful job of stressing no numbers until the very end to make sure you can summarize entire systems using logic- which he applies to the exams so you can solve all problems in generality. "
"If you transfer for the last year there's a chance that it will take you more than a year to finish. A lot of the time credits don't transfer 100%.

My friend transferred schools during her last year and the way her credits transferred meant she had another 2.5 years left to complete at the new school. 

If you're okay with potentially needing to do more than one year at a new institution go for it. If not just finish at UW"
"It's not just about me, it's about all general members we have a right to know. Transparency should be top of mind and the fact that you claim it's hard to convince people to make information public makes us nervous. What's going on, why such reluctance? The competition argument is a frail excuse at best, performance must be even worse than we can infer if making budgets public arises such debate. Show us the money please. "
"Lmao there are shit tons of victimless crimes by that definition. Do you also support personally owning nuclear weapons? There is no victim if you just own the nuke and don't use it on anyone. 

Just curious, are you (Like the Liberal party) in support of stricter gun laws while simultaneously saying that about weed? It is astounding how many people will advocated decriminalizing drugs and yet also want to ban other things."
"Look up strange activities and just force yourself to attend, see how you react to them.  

You don't need to tell anyone or do them again.  

In Toronto, on coop if you're in coop, there are even things in KW if you go looking for them.

If is easy to enjoy yourself more if you power through anxieties and invite the unknown.  Kill the concept of stranger danger, to start, and judgement, except the judgement of the mundane."
"The premium outlets in Halton Hills have always been a family favourite, they've just put in a new parking garage and are undergoing an expansion. It's an overall nice place to shop/walk around and chill out with friends, the food court however is not really my fav.

But if you are really just interested in the jacket, I'd recommend the Columbia store there, I'm pretty sure you can find something you like for around \~$200."
"To put it simply 30 degrees weather is perceived/felt differently in Bay Area than it does in New York in the summer. This is due to a lot of the reasons like how the buildings are built and the population density. Here’s an example about the buildings. Homes in Canada for example are mostly built with insulation to keep heat inside, while homes built in places like California are different and let more ventilation in. 

"
"Upvoted as this is the right answer. I had the same problem with Eduroam when I traveled to Guelph. You need to get them to put you on a list. I know in Guelph you could get a sponsor and you'd have access for one month. Or sweet talk them and they can get you in. Either way, Waterloo will be the same and I feel OP's frustration. Sigh, could have been so much easier. This is I'm sure a very common thing for students to use."
"What's the point of getting diagnosed with stuff like adhd or autism? Any drugs they give you either probably make you complacent/malleable or are nothing but a placebo effect. I would just learn how to work with or around whatever quirks you have instead of letting some psychologist tell you what to do. Unless you're just going for pity points so when people are socially dissapointed in you, you can say it's xxxxxx fault. "
"You decide between whether you want everyone's respect or your personal fulfillment. It's never easy but if you don't go into a nihilistic approach and choose neither, personal fulfillment is often the better choice. You just have to learn to not base your personal worth on others opinions. The right people will respect you if you command respect in your field. The others? You have to understand that they just don't matter."
"Nice what's your overall opinion of it as of rn? Ooh how far into completing an option or minor are you/did you get though? ��yea I get that, tbh up to this point in the term I think ive probably been spending more time on the one math course than on three of my other four put together bc I take forever to get through questions etc., etc

ngl it takes a bit of conscious effort sometimes, feels better overall so I think it's worth it though�� hahah imo they're good people but for the sake of keeping it relatively short and not combing through their personalities, etc, I'll just say that we all definitely each have our share of good *and* not so good traits/habits/etc "
"Well you're learning that's why you're in the course! ��

LMAO I FORGOT ABOUT THE EQAO thanks for the PTSD my dude ����. There are 4 articles of varying topics. I think they are usually science, politics, law, and literature/history but I could be wrong. And no you can't use extra time in other sections unfortunately it's 35 minutes and if you don't finish in time then tough luck you are required to move on. 

Cool! I have a friend studying linguistics in Toronto and she loves it. It's all so over my head but I think it's really neat how language evolves. I still think if Aliens came to earth they'd be most impressed by all our languages and our music tbh. ��"
"My dear, my unkown anonynous online friend, you are speaking as if there is some permanent requirement to plan your life, forever and ever.

"- Nice and clean formatting. Very easy to read
- If you have space you could add some additional info under your education like GPA, courses, projects, etc.
- Which tools/languages/systems did you use to develop the feature for Company #1? Also a lone bullet point looks a little sparse. See if you can add another 1-2 points here
- Strong points for Company #2. Good!
- What was unique about your learned Devops best practices for Company #3? What was the end result? Did this help you achieve something unique?
- Not sure if you need to include ""Co-op"" after each employment. They can tell the jobs were only 4 months if they're really confused they'll ask about it in the interview. Also try to change up your job title, even if it isn't what was listed on WaterlooWorks.
- Make the sentences under your projects into bullet points. You just want to stay consistent with your formatting
- What part of the data visualization did you create for linguistics pathways? 

Overall looks really good and you have valuable work experience. Honestly you shouldn't have too much difficulty landing a job as long as you write a good cover letter and make sure you tailor it appropriately. All the best!"
"**Fourteen Words**

Fourteen Words, 14, or 14/88, is a reference to slogans coined by white supremacist David Lane, a founding member of the terrorist organization The Order. The terms were coined while he was serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for his role in violating the civil rights of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered in June 1984. The slogans were publicized through now-defunct 14 Word Press, founded in 1995 by Lane's wife to disseminate her husband's writings.Lane also used the phrasing in other pamphlets including the ""14 points"" of his White Genocide Manifesto and further in his 88 Precepts essay, stressing his support for racial and ethnic religions, opposition to universal religions (such as Christianity), his opposition to miscegenation, his anti-Americanism, and support for racial separatism. Many of his concepts, ideology and values, particularly the Fourteen Words slogan, are either inspired by or derived from Adolf Hitler's autobiographical book Mein Kampf.

"About 35% of the class will be gone by 2nd year, don't assume you'll get curved out of failing a course. Moreover, courses are usually curved by slashing the denominator, which favours people with higher marks. For example, if someone has a 50/50, you have a 20/50, and the denominator gets cut to 45, the first guy now has 111% while you have 44%, which for most ECE courses will still land you in the automatic fail category.

"well then it makes you feel good unless your a sociopath, you don't piss off people, even if you are selective if someone sees you being an ass to someone else they're gonna see you as an ass.

 the main reason is that there is little to gain from being ""mean"" to the people you don't care about, but there is the potential of you losing from being a dick, generally speaking.

""A lot of people can still like you if you’re selective enough""
Basically everybody knows everybody within like 5 layers of mutual friends. If you're an ass, shit can spread around quickly. You literally can not be selective enough, especially around campus. Sure you can have a circle of friends, but you're literally just closing opportunities.

- ""Created and developed an issue tracker related to server..."" This seems a bit vague. Can you explain the server vulnerability issue a bit more and why it is relevant? What was the end result of your work? Did you improve something?
- ""Assisted in repairing a fingerprint..."" Assisted is a really weak verb to use on a resume because it doesn't fully explain what you contributed. It doesn't show whether you did 10% of the work or 90% of the work. Instead list exactly what work you did to repair this fingerprint authentication issue
- Your first bullet point under Machine Learning Research Assistant is way too long and is visually off-putting. Try to split it up into two different bullet points

"A lot of misinformation in this thread. UW historically does not look up vehicle owners from their license plate numbers. If the car has never been registered for a parking pass in the past, they don't know who should pay the ticket. Even if it was your personal car, my advice would still be to not pay the ticket unless you have already gotten a parking pass for that car. I have multiple friends who have incurred several tickets over their time here, paid none of them, graduated without issue. If you get too many tickets (usually more than 3) you could get towed, at which point you may have to pay your past tickets.

These are not municipal tickets, they are just issued by UW."

"To this point, (I'm pretty sure I can say this), the Board and the exec are aware of the need for a takeout service from the bomber and Kurt MacMillan (current VPOF) is working on implementing that. This Board is very keenly aware of the issue, and we regret that it came to our attention too late to really get ahead of the press on it. It's been an issue for so long that it's absolutely maddening that nothing has really changed. There were some changes heading into the Fall term, though, and we're trying to monitor it more closely, but it's also just one part of FedS and the Board members can't all be in on it all the time, because we're full time students and we're not paid to do this. 

In the end, the Bomber breakfast cost increase is something that should have happened sooner, and we're still probably losing money on it, but it's definitely provided more as a service to students than most of the rest of Bomber's offerings. "

"Mckay allegations: https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onhrt/doc/2013/2013hrto1644/2013hrto1644.html

Is this seriously what we're talking about when we talk about sexual assault? When I read this, I get the impression that (a) within a 10 second time frame he tried making a move, or maybe he grew up in a touchy-feely area where kissing and hugging is normal. Even the alleged bum grab was ""applied pressure"" and there was no mention of him being verbally dissuaded (b) He may or may not have given off negative vibes following the allegations. It is possible that he ignored clear body language on June 16, 2009 and it is possible that he was passively aggressive after being accused of sexual assault, but it is also possible that Morgan did not give off the ""don't touch me"" vibe and that instead of voicing her discomfort to Mckay chose to immediately report him and allowed a strong obsessive distaste to ferment. 

Conclusion: Don't touch any women you work with. Ever. Not even if they are attracted to you because if they change their mind they may become obsessed with doing whatever it takes to get you away from them. And don't work in the same room alone with them unless they are relatively asexual or appear to be completely disinterested in you. Definitely avoid working alone with women who appear to be interested in you. Because if someone in your workplace begins to fear or dislike you in obsessive proportions it could ruin your career. "

"It's not by race. Note I said something about assimilation.

Asian cultures treat women differently and hence their expression of femininity is different than Canadian women.

In the case of Chinese women, you find that they're more academically focused but also want children and marriage more often, and many would be stay at home moms or at least *enjoy* being a mom. 

In contrast, Canadian girls seem to think marriage and motherhood are forms of oppression to be put off until their mid 30s. 

So it's no surprise white guys are starting to like Asian girls; they are often far more feminine. 

There are of course some feminine white girls but good luck finding one that's single"

"The format reads way too minimalist I think; the amount of white space and hard to read font immediately make it stand out in a bad way.

In terms of the content, I think it needs a fair bit of work:

- You've listed lots of skills but there's basically nowhere on your resume you've highlighted how you've used or learned them

- Your jobs points are way too vague and don't give very much insight at all into what you did at your jobs. What does 'Managed the Admissions Office' mean? What skills and duties did you have? Similarly with 'managing content creation and marketing accross platforms' - what type of content, what platforms?

- Your interests should be more clearly separated from your education; it's confusing to read

- Your project descriptions all need to be re-done to highlight what technical skills you've used and implemented. Right now they don't sell your skills or provide any meaningful insight into what you created"
"&gt; don't be racist

This is your only argument, and it's not an argument.

Years of observing my 90% Chinese classmates isn't ""random"". 

White people *in math* have two choices: behave like their classmates or face one frustration after the next.

I still remember the time in first year I learned that Chinese people don't know what a ""line"" is. The midterm was the next day, so I wanted to ask the prof a question after class. I packed my stuff up quickly and went to the front of the class. Only one person got there before me, great. I'm second in line. Then 10+ fobs *swarm* the prof from all sides, waiting to ask him questions and I'm just in shock... I didn't yet realize this was normal behavior for these people.

Did I adopt their behavior, and just swarm the prof? No. I went to office hours or I made sure I was the first person to the front to ask the prof my question(s). Or I asked during class (which they also never do).

I've had *hundreds*, if not **thousands**, of such experiences. I had never even met more than a handful of Chinese people in my life before UW. You have zero clue how much of a culture shock this is; it was like immigrating to a foreign country. And like most minorities, I hate UW's majority Chinese behavior because they're nothing like me.

Chinese people do not behave the way Canadians do. And it's not even necessarily because of their race. That's just your inability to understand cultural differences."

The first time it was like cool I get it, getting in is stressful.  The second time it was like dude we answered you but I guess we can be more in depth and share what worked for us but might not work for him.

Now I can't tell if he's that desperate and idiotic or just trolling."
"The most important thing would be the smaller processing time.  3-&gt;1 year.  A wider selection of wanted careers as well as a reduced amount of time needed in the country to get a citizenship.

Also it’s worth noting, that having a friend or family already in the country massively increases the likelihood of getting accepted, as such the more immigrants you see in a community the more immigrants will come to that community."

"frustrating... 
My advice for future assignments 
- Talk to your prof - well before the assignment is due, make sure you're on the correct path. They don't mind talking to you about what you're writing, and giving a bit of feedback on your argument.  
- If you're struggling with the writing, get friends to proofread, or use UW services such as the Writing Centre. Sometimes the problem is not communicating your message clearly. "
"This article provides a rather incomplete view of the story, I'd recommend this article, as it provides much more detail. https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8933773-university-of-waterloo-sues-startup-in-patent-dispute/
If it is accurate, then the tech was discovered while the owners Salient Energy were working in a UW lab sponsored by another company, Argonne National Laboratory. It appears that UW had a contract with that company that granted it ownership of anything discovered in the sponsored lab. However, they never involved the researchers in that contract, resulting in this dispute. It seems they have no choice but to pursue this because of their agreement with Argonne."
"1) I dont even know what kind of books are there there. Basically I need the typical introduction of what I can get out of the library. 

2) Is there an online database of the books available there? That would be a lot easier than going there physically and go see what's available. 

3) My post is addressed to people who actually use these books. Maybe they would know better. I mean they could share what kind of books they read. 

To come back to your reply.

|Then read more until you know what they are about (if it interests you to do so)

Euhm. I didn't mean I want to know what each individual book is about.  I want to know what kinds of books are they. 

|2. Read books that you want to read.

I have no idea where to find the books that might interest me. The library is large. Euhm, Is there a map somewhere? So that I may know which category is on which floor/area/shelf ? 

I think if I get those basic answers I will be good.

"No analogy is perfect. But my analogy perfectly describes how you give someone what they want and they simply don't owe it to you to reciprocate.

If you throw the ball in their court, you have to accept it if they don't do what you expect. Even if there's deceit involved, you most likely didn't spend enough time to judge the person's character in the case of a hookup.

But I will still argue that (safe) sex does not have to be a serious act and can be the same as a favour or dancing or help with homework. The fact that some people are emotionally affected by it (and let's be real here, it's mostly girls) doesn't really change anything. Someone who spends 3 years trying to woo his friend and get out of the friend-zone is very damaging emotionally. But my point is, they should deal with it and accept the consequences of expecting something from someone who doesn't owe you anything.

&gt;If there was no communication about whether having sex with each other was just a hook up or was to start dating, then the onus is on both people for the lack of communication.

Sure. They both have to accept the consequences, but who ends up complaining in general? I haven't seen many guys complain"
"- I would stick to one level of bullet points. Your sub-bullets in your skills section looks out of place and strays away from the neat look of a typical resume
- I know you have your education listed under your name but you still need an Education section. Here you need to add your start and expected graduation date, relevant courses, GPA, any awards/scholarships, etc.
- You could probably tighten up the spacing between lines and sections so that you can fit in more relevant info
- ""architect, practitioner, wizard-in-training"" This is honestly unnecessary fluff. Just stay straight forward and say you're proficient of thing or shorten it to a list like this: ""Tools: DevOps, Linux, etc""
- Consider adding location to work experience. Gives context for which office you worked at. I.e. more impressive if you worked at head office or smallest abroad office
- ""Brought up a managed cloud platform from the ground up"" What does this entail? Did you design and code the entire thing yourself? Did you just project manage the project? Explain this a bit or use more precise language
- What tools did you use to deploy microservices to production?
- ""Built an autodiscovery system"" Which tools, languages, etc. did you use here?
- ""Led the adoption of IaC and DevOps concepts"". Can you list specific ones here?
- Your second bullet point under Jr. DevOpsEngineer should started with a verb. I.e. ""set-up automatic configuration...""
- ""Supported NetOps team"". Supported is a weak and ambiguous verb. How did you help them? What were your contributions? How did it help achieve the desired end result?
- Consider cutting out interests section after your add Education section and fill out your other experiences"
"In October 2017, in a conference call with investors, Schnatter blamed the National Football League for poor financial performance, stating ""The NFL has hurt us ... We are disappointed the NFL and its leadership did not resolve this"", referring to the U.S. national anthem protests by football players. Papa John's Pizza had a marketing agreement to be the ""official pizza company"" of the NFL and also had marketing deals with 23 of its individual teams, and Schnatter said the protests were hurting the company's sales of pizzas. Later that day, Papa John's announced that the NFL shield or ""official sponsor"" designation on Papa John's commercials and advertising would be removed.

On July 11, 2018, it was reported that Schnatter had used the word nigger during a conference call with marketing agency Laundry Service in May of that year, saying ""Colonel Sanders called blacks niggers and Sanders never faced public outcry"". 

In 1999, Schnatter was accused of stalking and groping a woman. He claimed the woman was trying to extort him for $5 million. The situation ended with a confidential settlement.

Schnatter was involved in a 2009 sexual misconduct incident with a 24-year-old female marketing employee, resulting in another confidential settlement.

In 2012, Papa John's and Schnatter received media attention after he made critical comments about the Affordable Care Act to a class on entrepreneurship. In a shareholder conference call, Schnatter said that he opposed the ACA because ""our best estimate is that the Obamacare will cost 11 to 14 cents per pizza

Schnatter contributed to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and made supportive comments about his administration in January 2017"

"To add to this, I think a lot of people fail to see that a part-time job or any work experience (even if unrelated) is helpful. In my AIF, I didn't have any ECs other than student council, but I worked throughout high school (summers and during the school week).

This is helpful because work experience is very useful for co-op, even if it's not engineering work. I worked as a waitress and in retail. But it shows you have skills you need to succeed in the work place, time management (especially if working during the school year), and experience outside of the classroom.

I think people tend to underestimate the positive effects of having employment before university. I met so many people in first year who had never had a job and it shocked me. I think people tend to look down on high school jobs, but you learn a lot and are far more likely to succeed in the workplace if you have been employed before, and the university knows this. "
"I went through something very similar with my mom passing away during my 4A term (including the doctors not taking it seriously at first). There were weeks on end of hospital visits, having to make the decision to pull life support, then funeral stuff which definitely distracted me from school.

Maybe the opposite of what some people are suggesting, but I think me just powering through the semester was actually helpful. The toughest period of time after my mom's death was after all the funeral stuff was over and people were going back to there regular lives and you are just left with your thoughts. Being forced to focus on school was definitely a reprieve from that and I think made it a bit easier to deal with it. My marks ended up being more or less the same as they always were, if that matters to you.

Its been almost exactly 3 years since then, I wouldn't say it gets easier, you just adjust. Still to this day the hardest part for me is when I accomplish something (graduating, job, promotion etc.) my first instinct is to tell my mom and then remembering I can't.

All the other smart glass prototypes looked significantly worst (even intels which had a pretty legit prototype).

"So the midterm to start was a little unfair, but that's not going to help you. 

* Ace all quizzes, stay on your game there. 
* Ace all labs, this is important esp if you have Dida, since unlike mansour instead of ""curving"" she just ""adjusts the weights"". 
* The final can eat up midterm weight

So: If the class did really bad they might leak the types of questions, but it's usually one free, one parallel axis theorem, one ""pool ball"" and a few others 

do every final you can find - but what's really important is that you understand the concepts and how they apply to questions.

"&gt; that allows you to approach homeless people without fear of being raped or harassed for being a minority

You know, I re-read this and I have to comment further.

Have you every spoken with a homeless person?

Let's re-read your comment here a bit:

""without fear of being raped or harassed...""

Homeless people are the weakest people on the planet.  They have lost everything, even a home.  How, are they in any position whatsoever, to rape or harass you?

You, you, I presume we chatted previously, but ""you"" generally (the average UW reader, privileged in many ways, at least enough to be attending higher education in safe and healthy country like Canada) have so much more power over that homeless person.  You have a place to stay, an idea of where your next meal comes from, some concept of a job in the next four months (probably), the ability to get yourself to a clinic if you have a health concern, which you probably don't.

Why on earth are YOU afraid of the homeless person?  The homeless person has no power, has no ability, has already lost everything -- what kind of ""white privilege"" is necessary to approach a person who has nothing?  

Homeless in Canada is a special kind of homeless, because it is lethal.  Canada has the peculiar climatic situation where winter will naturally clean up the homeless people every season.  Surely there are readers here from Mumbai or someone who knows what Kibera is, where the sun shines perpetually and the homeless don't die for lack of a roof.  

Honestly my friend, your comment resonates with the idea that there is something dangerous or fearful about homeless people?  This is an unfortunate commentary on reality, where the weakest people in our community are demonized as inhuman and a threat.

I will not be back to Canada until August 2019 but when I am, if you are willing, let's take a tour of downtown Kitchener and I will introduce you to some homeless friends of mine, if they are still alive."

"It depends on what your philosophy is. I really don't think that the goal of society should be to have as many children as possible. Social security requires young people to continuously pay in, but with a large enough society it doesn't really matter if a small percentage of people don't have children. Childless people are taxed more already, because parents get tax credits for each child and non-parents do not.

Personally, I think the philosophy underlying a society should be providing everyone with freedom and an opportunity to work hard and succeed. This freedom would include the choice to have children or not.

To reiterate, I think you're conflating acceptance with ""promotion"" of a lifestyle. If there were a society of people who were regularly violent against infertile people, would it be destructive to discourage violence  against them? It's not like people choose to be infertile, just like how people don't choose to be gay."
"do the assigned practice problems

then do more practice problems

Only check the answers *After* you have solved. If you did it wrong, proceed with the next steps and MAKE SURE to do the type of problem again several times so it's drilled into your head.

When you inevitably get stuck on one, ask your friends who are smarter than you who you are studying with (if you're not doing this, study in groups with friends who are smarter than you. If you have no friends in the class, start making them already like just introduce yourself to the people sitting next to you and chat between lectures)

If you still don't get a problem (make sure to come back to the ones you flopped a day or two later), go to the TAs and/or prof for office hours and ask for more help.

With this strategy you should do fine until the final. I can't speak for rolling with friction I never really got that.

"Bro same situation. Aced highschool English and any standardized testing before the ELPE. Then was shocked to fail it. It's another cash grab done by this goddamn university. They don't grade based on creativity or anything. They grade on how well you follow the rubric that you've never been shown. So for example you could fail for not having a title or having 1 too few paragraphs or making the same spelling mistake a couple times throughout your essay.

So what do you do? You can try to dispute it but that likely won't work. Still worth a try. Maybe your marker was extra cuntish. You can rewrite it if you are given the option. However if you are not, you will have to take a mandatory English course. I took eng109 online which was a living hell. Just a bunch of people who didn't want to be there with a bunch of TAs who just assigned marks arbitrarily and a prof that didn't give two fucks. 

But that's just my experience. Maybe when you review yours, they will find a mistake made by the marker and pass you. Oh and I also forgot to mention that you needed to speak to your academic advisor. Make an appointment with them rn and also make an appointment to review your ELPE test. Good luck!"
"- Do you have relevant courses that you can include in your Education section? Look for buzzwords and ones that sound impressive. This gives recruiters a better sense of the program at the university and what you've learned so far
- Not sure because of the redacted info at the top but you should consider adding a location (city is enough) to provide context for where you are based out of
- See if you can find a better word than ""Highly Proficient:. It's too close to your other category of ""Proficient"", i.e. ""Fluent""
- Provide cities/location for your work experience. It's relevant for recruiters to see which office/HQ you worked at
- Work Experience #1: What kind of software did you develop, which languages/tools/programs did you use and what kind of diagnostic data did you collect and how? Your second bullet point is too long. Instead of using two verbs each time (i.e. designed + developed, process + store) pick the strongest verb or find one that covers both aspects. ""Cloud, local, and offsite datastore"" Is there a more succinct way of saying this?
- It is a bit redundant to have a static list of skills used at each work experience. You've already listed them in your summary of skills and mentioned them in your work experience bullet points. I would remove these and focus on your bullet points demonstrating which skills you used
- You double-up on verbs waaay to much in your bullet points. This is why every looks cramped. Write more succinctly and fluff what you did a bit less. Stick to the point. The recruiter does not have all day
- Work Experience #2. Don't use the word ""responsible for"" to start a bullet point. It is too vague and does not properly demonstrate what exactly you did. Start with an action verb instead. How did you translate corporate vision into software? This doesn't make sense to me as written. Did you ensure code met standards of something? Can you be more specific here?
- Work Experience #3: 27 welds in under 55 seconds sounds impressive but if this is a standard HR guy reading then this means nothing to them. Instead write how you increased produced and reduced build time. Do you really need to use 4 verbs for your last bullet point? This is excessive. Choose one, two at most.
- Provide dates and locations for your projects to provide context
- Your second bullet point under ""Maze Solving Robot"" should start with a verb, a specific action you took
- Re-write bullet points under ""Hotel Reservation Web Application"" to start with verbs to highlight skills you developed or tasks you completed. Also you again use 4 verbs for your second bullet point. Please condense!
- Don't ever put ""etc."" on a resume. Your recruiter doesn't know what the other ambitious tasks are that you're not listing and will assume you're using this as filler. Find a nicer way to say this or just list a few
- Does the object.goal of the Unity Mini-Game matter? Instead focus on tools/skills used

"&gt; huh? boarding school? I moved out at 18 and I thought that was early by today's standards LOL..

Nah, I moved to Vancouver for high school and lived with my aunt and uncle for a brief period of time. Been living on my own ever since and became financially independent two years ago.

&gt; And I've had to adjust my life significantly, sometimes at monetary and other cost, to feel like I actually have a social life...There are top Universities in my home country, I should be able to attend them, but I just can't stomach the isolation and feeling like I'm living in a foreign country anymore.

I'm sorry to hear that, and I totally agree. In hindsight I could've gone to the top universities (global top 30 ones) in my home countries and led a much more fruitful and content life there. Wouldn't have to be considered a second-class citizen here (which I totally understand).

&gt; I don't know what ended up happening there. I stopped following it, even though I'm probably the one person that should know what happened....

Were you one of the TAs? Afaik there were multiple entries pertaining to this case in the new disciplinary records published by the university a few days ago.

&gt; I just assumed the class average was high because we were recruiting the top students from these massive countries.

Oh boy you are in for a surprise. I know at least 3 international students (and 2 domestic students of Chinese descent who naturalized after 4 years in Canada) who admittedly **forged** their academic records to get in to UW (some of them already did two years of university in China and lied on their AIF about ""volunteering"" during that gap). There are groups on Chinese social media that just straight up share solutions to assignments and exams. It's honestly disgusting and shameful.

&gt; Imagine how that feels for me... Like I don't want to just complain but it's kind of absurd. My family arrived in this country before it was even ""Canada"", and now I live as a foreigner.

Again, I'm sorry to hear that. I wish I could empathize with you on that but it's literally impossible for me since Canada is the first non-ethnostate I've lived in. I think high-quality, strictly vetted, and controlled migration is a fantastic idea, but I don't know why people get labelled as racists when they voice the slightest displeasure when it comes to disruptive, irregular mass immigration (which is totally different from the former imho).

&gt; I'm not leaving Canada immediately anyway. I'm just applying for jobs in Toronto and I plan to live in the most Scottish and luckily also the richest area of the GTA where my in-laws live...

That's great. I hope you are able to live a normal life again, all the best.

&gt; Well what's unfortunate is that I came here under the impression that I would get some sort of timeless education in mathematics.

This is /r/me_irl back in first year, and the sudden realization that this place is by no means a prestigious educational institution hit me hard. I've come to terms with it now, and I kinda appreciate the co-op terms and work experience I've gotten thanks to this place.

&gt; Sorry, I don't. I should really just say ""Chinese"". I've learned a lot about different Asian cultures; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian (Sikhs, Hindus) etc. I've read their old works, religious texts, histories etc. I was just trying to be brief.

Sorry I kinda overreacted, but it *is* a daily annoyance for me when people just use the umbrella term ""Asians"" (especially if used by whitewashed GTA Asians).

&gt; Canada is the bastion of kindness for sure.

It was when I first arrived back in 2011. Not anymore. ""So kind to the point of being detrimental"", very well put. Trudeau actually was a sub at my high school.

"Lol I graduated CS DD last year and I had several classes I never went to even once, I skipped like at least 100/125-150 class sessions per term in my last few terms. I also never bought or read textbooks after first year, I basically just read the slides and went with it. It is very possible but it depends on the class and the person. In my opinion first year courses are a lot less suited to this strategy but after that it works fine really.

The really big problem for DD is that a lot of Laurier classes have participation marks, some as much as 20% of the class is marks for participating in class. If it was only 5% sometimes I just forfeited it but 20% you basically have to go. Some of the earlier classes also do sneaky things like literally asking questions on the exam about some random thing from lecture which there is no way to know if you didn't go. That happens less and less after first year but it is a thing that Laurier does."

Anyway regardless of whether you work at a start-up, found a start up, or join a huge company like SAP or IBM, you wont change the world, at least not for the better, because the singular goal is to make profit for shareholders.

So....  when companies have mission statements or other feel good platitudes, it's designed simply to keep the drones in line and making money for the CEO.  as a founder, you should know this - it's necessary to exploit your staff for your own personal benefit.

"It depends on how good of a leader you are. For simplicity, let us assume that (A) you are socially crippled and incapable of dealing with more than a handful of people at a time or (B) you are a god among men who can sway people with a word. I recommend the following strategy: 

(A): Quietly befriend as many (fledgling) politicians and lawyers as possible. Find one or two equally motivated people with a money making interest which is similar to yours, come up with a new idea, and start a business. Use your politician friends to get quicker approval for starting your business, and perhaps some business-friendly legislation. If you are extremely ambitious, you could attempt to use both the politician and lawyers friends to receive accreditation to severely handicap future competition. A banker friend wouldn't hurt either. Since you are socially crippled, no one will suspect a thing since many people probably won't even realize that you are friends and will underestimate you. How well this strategy works probably varies from country to country, since some places care a lot more about conflict of interest than others. 

(B): Be like a typical South Korean president and use your oral powers to rise to the very top. Then proceed to use your powers to milk everyone and make an absolute killing with minimal effort. I do recommend being smarter than those dumb presidents who got caught. Basically, just be like your average American politician. "
"I mean I can only tell you as far as my own experience. I listened to tons of advice and it just varies per person. That little blob of waking up was just to explain why I realized one day I felt better. 

In my experience (assuming that's what you're asking) I thought about my life a year ago, 2 years, 3 years ago etc. and realized how I didn't change anything yet everything was different. I just felt not in control of my life, I wasn't in the program I wanted, my grades were slowly slipping cause of it, my relationships were messing up from random drama I don't want to even think about. I posted a different comment that referenced what a redditor on this sub once told me, change something. To me that meant take control of my life, decided what I wanted to do. I'm still lazy mofo, but before I would be sleep in till 2 or 3pm, sleeping at 5:30 am or 6 am pretty much daily, I changed that so I wake up early, 8 am or 9 am. It feels better getting up with the sun, I'm still trying to get up earlier, maybe have enough motivation to go to the gym one day early morning. I'm trying to care more about my looks, and it gives me more confidence in life, spending some more money on my own physical stuff rather than shawarma everyday for lunch. Realizing that having a small friend group is not a bad thing, and in some cases, the complete opposite, helped me cope with the lost relationships I had.

These are just some of the things that helped me, maybe they'll help you too. As you can see, my lifestyle isn't anywhere near good, but I'm happy for the improvement, and in the first time in a long time I actually feel like I'm somehow getting somewhere, slowly, but moving still. 

I hope that helps man."
"I remember a similar problem when the School of Architecture moved to Cambridge -- I was FEDS exec in the first years after it moved and you had to take Route 7 to Fairview, then transfer to the Route 52 to Ainslie. It took forever. The Route 200 came and made that more tolerable. But our success in advocating for better transit between campuses wasn't because of anything we did -- the Route 200 was part of the Region's long term plan to connect our region along the central transit corridor, which was first identified in planning documents in the 1970s (the corridor is one of the five things I'd list in a TL:DR from my wife's PhD dissertation). 

Stratford isn't in Waterloo Region, so it would fall under intercity transportation regulated by the province. Think Greyhound and Coach Canada (private operators) and GO Transit (public). Those require a business case to secure an investment of routes, and based on my recollection of travel patterns in/out of this region, it would be a hard one to make. 

So the best place for advocacy on this issue would be through FEDS with the University itself to improve that service. The University controls the existing service level and schedules, the Faculty of Arts manages academic requirements and course offerings so could realign offerings and schedules to match transportation schedules. Working with the GBDA department, Faculty of Arts, and University is important -- there are student reps at each of those levels (I presume there is one at the GBDA level; I know there are at the others). 

And if there is a student-focused, campus to campus business case to be made, the FEDS may even be convinced to run a different kind of FED Bus run.

"This is so overcomplicated.  Immigration officers know next to nothing and are barely empowered to think at all.  They have never heard the term ""code monkey"" and to them programming and engineering is all the same crap that they don't care about.

Their job is to match a checklist quickly, enough to cover their ass that they won't get in shit, and then move to the next itemized manual labour they need to do.

Everything, absolutely everything, that you need to do to get your own TN is right here:

https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/employment/visas-canadian-mexican-nafta-professional-workers.html

Don't go to anyone else's bullshit opinion page about it.  The guy at the border strictly follows everything on that page and nothing more.  Like any beauracracy, he get's in shit if he thinks for himself.

Ergo, you must look like a computer systems analyst or an engineer.  WRite up your own supporting documentation letters and just have your work endorse/reprint/stamp/sign it on company letterhead.  Use the word ""engineer"" freely.  Check the boxes in their head for them.  Make it bluntly obvious that what the company wants you to do matches the list on the link I attached, whether it's true or not.  DOn't overthink anything and don't concern yourself about what's ""actually true"" according to the bullshit you happen to think about your job, the career, the law, or anything else.  Just match the paperwork to the guy who holds the stamp.

there are no distinctions between 'software engineer' or 'software developer' or 'code monkey' or 'programmer' or key words that idiot at the border is looking for to disclude you.  You could even stretch it and use 'technologist' if you want, it's on the list.  He simply wants to see something that pretty solidly matches what his training has told him must match - and that's it. seeing the word 'engineer' anywhere on the paperwork that is signed by your employer is enough.

et voila you're in."
"&gt;Equality

Before the law, not in general because equality in general requires the deconstruction of existing communities and the construction of one social community which I consider to be undesirable. Also, equality within the country we reside in because stability and order are essential to creating conditions where people are optimistic about the future and are willing to invest their time and money for long term gain. Assuming equality means all people should have equal access to everything is implicitly an infringement on my right to decide what and who I care about and this is implicitly an infringement on cultural autonomy. 

&gt;hegemony, etc

Europeans developed a major technological and resource advantage over other countries, and also had major confidence (perhaps overconfidence) in their culture and way of doing things. This made them both willing and able to assert themselves globally with little opposition. The world wars - which were in a large part European wars between the colonial haves and have nots - were far more draining than colonialism and a combination of neglect, weakened European will, and financially and resource draining wars likely played a large role in the rapid collapse of colonialism. Now these cultures are beginning to assert themselves and those of European descent are quite frankly not equipped to deal with this (It doesn't help that the progressives have effectively chopped our legs off by painting any attempt to assert ourselves as ""racist"" or ""privileged"" - because apparently having your own culture is now merely a privilege), so there is no reason to believe that those of European descent will come out on top in a cultural war (especially when demographic projections are factored in). It is quite possible that we would be assimilated into other cultures if we were ""open to experience"" at this point in time, especially with the way progressives have crippled our ability to share or assert our own experience. 

&gt;East Asia over Merkel/May

Merkel and May clearly don't care about their people or culture. Both of them being childless simply proves this. At least East Asian countries seem to have some idea of what makes culture work and are willing to defend it, and I think East Asians would be pragmatic enough to allow me to buy culturally autonomy in exchange for economically contributing at an above-average level. This is essentially what I (my family) is already doing and the deal gets worse and worse every year and I would not be surprised if blatant attempts to remove that right come out within a decade or so. Arab/Muslim/Africans are extremely socialistic and a cursory glance at their countries also shows that they are extremely intolerant of people who do not wish to partake in their cultural insanity. Therefore, I would much rather be economically integrated into a country ruled by East Asians than by a country dominated by cultures which seem to be predisposed to overly demanding socialism. "

When you complain about not being able to figure out the condition for when the loop is run, it means you don't understand the structure well enough, past just ""i&lt;n"". Reevaluate how much you *actually* know, because ""I know it, I just don't get this problem"" is very contradictory. When you recognize that maybe you actually don't know it, you can start to learn.

Bike WITH traffic and if there is no protected right turn lane then DON'T bike straight through the intersection to the right of traffic: Either walk your bike across the cross walk or merge with traffic when you go through the intersection.

I've TAed for profs who were pushovers for grade grubbers, but all of the writing-centric courses I TAed the prof warned review seekers that their grade could move either way. Your efforts, as other people ITT have suggested, are almost always better invested before submitting the assignment by having your prof or TA review your work with you and get you on the right track.

"&gt; I don’t believe students who don’t drink at bomber should be subsidizing beer for those that do.


Hi /u/The_Nanoengineer I just want to clarify that the alcohol at the Bombshelter cannot be subsidized by student fees because that would be a violation of the [Bar-Operating Agreement with the University](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/pub-operating-agreement-2010.pdf) and associated internal protocol from the accounting department that limit what alcohol can be reimbursed.

"What I am saying is, that in the states, if you have a computer science degree you are hired as a software engineer. 

The distinction between software engineer and software developer is made in Canada. In Canada, you can’t get hired as an engineer unless you have a P.Eng designation. 

You don’t need to specifically apply to jobs in which the title is Software Engineer, as it is basically implied you’re doing a software engineering role even if it says “Full Stack Developer”. Most likely the job title will be Software Engineer - Full Stack, but in the off chance that it actually says Full Stack Developer, it literally means the same thing, 

With regards to you saying you don’t believe you are capable of “software engineering”, I’d like to reiterate that everyone in the states gets hired as a “Software Engineer”, from bootcamp grads to CS PhDs, it’s literally the Canadian equivalent of “Software Developer”. "
"I'll give my 2 cents. Just for context I'm an upper year DD Laurier 
 based Student, who is also much more focused on the technical co-ops compared to the more business oriented careers.

Firstly, i know bu111 sucks, and so does bu121. IMO the BU courses dont really get interesting till 2nd year and when things stop being so broad and they start diving into details. Upper year finance/accounting/econ courses are much closer to your typical UW math/cs course, compared to the first year courses. No where near as difficult, but it still a lot more interesting from a technical/problem solving stand point. Thus i really wouldn't recommend dropping till at least 2a is over, so u actually experience some more in depth courses, but ofcourse this is jus my opinion.

Secondly, WLU co-op has a surprising amount of technical jobs on navigator, especially for your 1st or 2nd co-op. There isn't US jobs and some of the more prestigious companies in Canada, but there are plenty of banks/ small companies that are great for your first 1 or 2 co-ops, which are the hardest to get. 

So i would personally recommend sticking out 1st year and 2a, but if there really isn't ANYTHING that interests you in BBA, you might as well drop as your just wasting time that you can be spending on things of bigger interest. Feel free to PM me if you have additional questions.  

EDIT: Excuse the horrible spelling, ive been staring at a textbook for like 10 hours at this point"
"It does sound like a few things changed since I TA-ed 111L, however I can give you a few tricks that are hopefully still relevant:

* look at the 111L books, at least previously there were 2-3 experiments that both classes do, however they are given pages similar to the chem labs, where there is fill in the blanks for a lot of the report - basically copy this setup and bring this to you lab
*  make an excel sheet so you don't need to spend time doing the calculations including determining you standard deviation/standard error and producing sample grafts (good check if your data makes sense)
* divide the work with your lab partner(s) strategically, spend 5 minutes to make a plan for the lab (ideally before the lab starts)
* don't lose stupid marks - include the correct units, sample calculations, correct sig figs, etc.
* do all the equation derivations and any pre-lab questions before lab
* read the instructions carefully - sometimes the questions are pretty buried in the lab methods
* have a template discussion and conclusion before lab - eg. we determined the gravity constant to be \_\_\_\_\_  (+/-) \_\_\_\_\_\_ m/s^(2) by (whatever you are going to do in the lab) this does (not) encompass the true value of 9.81 m/s^(2) 
* set up your grafts beforehand - title, axes, labels, slope of the line calculations, etc. 

Because there is no take home aspect to the lab, all the 'homework' is in the prep. When I took the course I spent approximately 3 hours before lab getting ready.   


Also watch the lab exam!   


Historically sections averages were belled to the course average so if your class had a particularly high average, makes can drop significantly and then students were unprepared for the exam (believing they were doing much better than in reality) and end up failing. Unfortunately it was very tricky and generally people don't do very well, understanding the labs as you do them will help you a lot during a busy final exam season.

"Dude don't worry, I also busted this term and only got 1 interview (2A ECE lots of side projects). However, I did get a crap tonne of interviews way above my weight class from external applications, so it might not be your resume and just Waterloo works.

"I found the key is to actually make sure you fully understand a problem or concept, if you do it will beast to remember, or derive it or use it. Often I think people don’t actually understand something fully when they move on. It’s easy to look at it and just say okay, but you should make sure you would be able to figure it out by yourself. It doesn’t actually take much more time, but the way you look at the concept/problem is key."
I wish I had been more involved in my program. I graduated and knew basically 0 people. i never went to any department events because I knew 0 people.

"Maybe I'm just a jerk, but I honestly think if your high school has failed to prepare you for even one of the ece 105 midterm questions, not even **one**, you really shouldn't have been admitted. 

The midterms are hard, yes, I agree. They weren't exactly fair, there usually isn't enough time to really think about the difficulty of the problems, but if you can't do ANY of them, your high school physics class has failed. 

&gt; But honestly why can’t we take PHYS115 instead of 105?

You only take one mechanics, one E&amp;M. 

&gt; Any tips on how to study and pass the course?

I'd suggest you start by learning the material

[Old midterm](https://exams.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/pdfs/ECE%20105%20-%20Midterm%20-%20Bizheva,%20Strickland,%20Balogh%20-%20F'15%20-%20Electrical%20and%20Computer%20-%20Solution.pdf), you'll need to log in to the exambank to see it.

"The fact that you got a 67 after putting in a lot of effort means only one thing: that effort almost certainly wasn't applied effectively. Don't feel stupid for ""wasting"" it - you couldn't have done better without fixing that problem. Your prof had something he/she was looking for in that essay; he/she probably had a rubric, or if not, at least some expectations that you can probably find in some handout somewhere on Learn, and you didn't direct your efforts there. 

Go to office hours, and just very earnestly tell him/her the same thing in your post: I spent X hours on this essay, pouring everything I had into it, and it was no good. That feels kinda shitty right now, but it's clear that I wasn't actually working towards your expectations. Could you clarify to me why I got the mark I did, and what I can do better next time?

67 on a 35% essay means you've lost 11.3%. You're right that scoring 80 out of 88.7 is a lot harder, but it's nowhere near impossible - it's ""just"" a 90! I could very easily see someone in your position, who then asks the prof for help, achieving that, especially with your determination. The prof may even be willing to move some weighting around if he/she sees you really trying to learn and improve. 

If your parents are scraping together what little they have for your schooling, and *failing one course* (&lt;80, whatever that's for) invalidates your entire degree, what would *giving up* mean? You're right to think of your education as an expensive investment for your family; ""ending it now"" in any sense just wastes it entirely. 

Keep your head up. Your goal just got harder, but it's not even close to impossible, and there are concrete steps you can take to achieve it. "
"&gt; some no-name startup name holds the same weight as Google?

once upon a time, all bign were no name startups.  so in a way the name doesn't matter.  i gather your goal is to make a lot of money, in that sense joining a no name startup that gives you professional latitude is the only way to possibly make more than a steady-state no-risk job at google.

additionally, the ""name on a resume"" factor is only cool and important to your buddies showing off dicks every coop round.  in real life a hiring manager needs to justify the cost of your headcount, and for that, the accomplishments of your previous work is much more important than the person who paid you to do it.  apple, google, they all work on impressive sounding big picture projects, and pay well, but it doesn't mean YOUR JOB there is any more interesting than anywhere else, automatically.  A real hiring manager will look at what YOU DID, because everyone already knows what Google does - any you are not designing a search engine from 20 years ago yourself personally.  You think wearing an Armani suit to your interview gives you an advantage?  You're logic is the same and equally absurd.  

So yeah, a no-name startup holds just as much ""weight"" as a name like ""google"" if you're talking to anyone but your autistic friends in 1B.

&gt; so flipping burger at McDonald == SWE at Google?

IN a very real way, yes.  I hinted what that way is, can you see it?

The primary difference is just the salary involved - which seems like is all you can see.  Most SWE's are digital burger flippers, especially in Cali.  That's what you're either aiming for, or already are.  You'll flip burgers until google changes the way a BBQ is built or suddenly veggy burgers are the only thing people want - at which point a new kind of burger flipper will replace you because they work for 80% of your wage and, frankly, they are experts in the new BBQ while you're busy arguing why charcoal is important for years to come."

"Sure, but Indian people only != Brown people only.

If someone said Italians only or something, that wouldn't be as bad as white people only.

"I feel you exactly, I go back and forth wondering if I'm the problem. I had friends in high school who are still my best friends and every co-op I have good experiences with students from other schools.

It probably is my own introversion along with everyone else in math faculty being similar. Realizing I dont really wanted to study math probably didn't help either.

I'm finishing my last term here and partly because I couldn't find just a fall sublet and half because mentally I just collapse living here, I chose to commute two times a week from home. It's good to just chill with friends when I'm home, the isolation really gets to me when I lived here. 

The one thing I really regret thinking back is all the connections I could've made here that I didn't. Whether I choose to blame my own insecurities or the environment of the school, doesn't really matter, just trying to make the next few years of my life different than the time I had here."
"In my day everyone failed the course and then they belled it.  Actually this was true for a lot of the courses back then now that I think about it.  We used to say ""learn what you can learn and don't worry about what you can't"".  AKA prioritize.

I am reading all these threads these last few weeks and it seems today's students expect their profs to teach them.  That is not their job.  Its to lead you  (which many do badly, sadly) and judge you.  Sometimes they want to judge how well you all do in failure.  We were actually told that by one C&amp;O prof after he had proudly announced the class avg was a whopping 34% after 2 midterms, a couple of assignments and with a final on the horizon that was only worth 20% meaning no one could pass the course. 

Its to late probably for you to hit the prof during office hours but take advantage of them after the midterm.  That is the time they actually teach and help.  Unless they can't speak english. "
"These studies assessed effects after a non-smoker sat in proximity to a smoker. Ventilation (where provided) was caused by the opening and closing of a door.  
1 - I don't think anybody is suggesting smoking of any kind be allowed indoors  
2 - Effects of sitting next to someone smoking in a room will be exponentially intensified when compared to outdoors  
*Consider* how windy it is in Waterloo  
*Consider* the volume of a room vs volume of an open area  
3 - Canada's policy will soon treat cannabis similarly to tobacco.  
*Consider* the medical research that must have occurred prior to any consideration of legalization  
*Consider* the public consultation necessary in this process  
4 - Outdoor smoking appears to mitigate those negative effects of cannabis consumption  
  
That same study states ""Alignment of tobacco and marijuana smoking bylaws may result in the most effective public policies."". Perhaps the University should do the same."

"For this, I think it is better to try and think beyond trying to fix what has already come to pass. She failed the exam. So instead of thinking of ways to make her unfail the exam, look at scenarios were she has to deal with her failed midterm. 

Can she drop the course? Because if she gets a 30%, her grade can only go as high as 75 for the final grade, and even pulling off a 90% from here on out only gets her a 69 final grade. 

If she really can't, she needs to look at her other courses and see if she can raise her grades in the other courses to compensate for the deficit this course will have. 

If all else fails, then take a look at worse case scenario, which is she can't go to grad school next year. That certainly doesn't mean she can never go to grad school, or even that she has to wait long before getting in. Idk how that process works, but yall can figure that out with some research, and talking to admissions officers or whatever.

The Commercial Services have UW Food Services and other food providers on and around campus as *direct competition* for student interest. FedS already has to operate within limited parameters compared to a business such as Molly Bloom's because of the alcohol policy on campus. It makes it more expensive and harder for FedS to operate Bomber as a bar because of the *extra protections for students* that FedS provides (and the University demands) because we provide *services* (and should be, rightly so) more-so than we operate businesses. It is also, as u/GreenBurette mentioned, our practice to protect our employees' confidential pay information. 

That said, if you are interested in seeing this change, I would encourage you to run for an At-Large Board of Directors seat in the Winter term. I have and continue to advocate for better transparency and accountability at Board, as well, so if you want, you can **PM me** and I can field your concerns and see if there's anything we can do at Board to increase FedS transparency within areas of Commercial Services without opening the Federation up to undue risk. I can assure you the current Board takes confidentiality and transparency very seriously and we're always trying to find out how to share what is appropriate to share with the students who care, such as yourself."
"If you are that young consider reading this piece by Celia Green, an invitation to young people:

[The Human Evasion - Why the World Will Remain Sane](http://www.theabsolute.net/minefield/humevas.html#14)

It's not hard to read.  It's extremely difficult to interpret.  But perhaps you're a smrt young person, who can do many thinga.

If you have further questions it's better to PM me.  Enjoy!

AN OPEN LETTER TO YOUNG PEOPLE

To be a genius has never been too easy, granted the tendency of the human race to like frustrating them. It is no easier in this century than any other time.

In fact, it is rather more difficult, as in this century it is believed that an unrecognised genius is impossible.

However, I have in Oxford a place in which it is possible to carry on the struggle for survival, and I am looking for people to join me. There are at present too few of us, and this makes the struggle for survival even more difficult.

I cannot give a brief summary of my ideas; they are original, and that means they are difficult to communicate. However, I have written a book, The Human Evasion, which while containing a rather small fraction of what I think, does give an introductory impression of my outlook. If you find this too uncongenial, I think you should not bother to get in touch with me to find out any more.

If, on the other hand, having read the book, you do want to know anything more about what I think, and to see whether you would like to join us, there is no alternative to coming to Oxford for a time.

Please write to me, in the first instance, care of the publishers of this book.

CELIA GREEN

The address is:
Institute for Psychophysical Research
118 Banbury Road
Oxford, England"

"I had zero extracurriculars.

I was admitted in May, after I already paid the UofC deposit. So certainly not first round or whatever it would be. 

I didn’t apply in grade 11, is that what you’re trying to do? So I don’t have much I can say about that. I applied right before the 105D deadline, I think it was Dec 2015/Jan 2016? I was frosh 2016. 

I did Math 30 in grade 11 along with some other of my 30 levels, first half of Gr. 12 (Sept-Dec 2015) I did calc and the rest of the 30s except for English. So pretty much all of my 30 levels were on record already for when I applied (and my English 20 was something in the 90s iirc). I basically had no classes for the second half of grade 12. "
"I never asked why.

I'm telling you that you shouldn't rely on other people to be or have the solution to your problems. I'd hope that your boyfriend is trying his best, and if his best isn't helping then you either need to communicate that with him or suck it up.

I'm also saying that *some* people give really general advice when they don't care about the issue. That's not to say that everyone youve ever talked to has been like this, its just occasionally the reason.

If you're actually considering killing yourself or suffering from depression then you should seek professional help rather than just help from your boyfriend. Often loved ones can't help much with depression even if they try. "
"Make sure you know how to do the taxprep. So practice the questions they give you on the software and make sure you fill in the numbers in the proper spots etc. There will probably also be a theory component that is worth quite a bit less, so you should know the theory too, just don't focus on it. If you went to class and got most of the taxprep stuff down, you should be good to go. Don't aim for perfection, it'll overwhelm you, just aim to get *most* things right and you should be fine. There will probably be a curve, and audit is the easier section anyway, so even if you get wrecked you'll live. 

This is all assuming they haven't fundamentally changed the format from prior years though :P"
"Why are the practice midterm or exam not representative of the exam? 

And also, that's a thing I have problem with, proof questions. When I look at the solutions after, it seems so obvious to me and I understand how it works. But I never know how to start these questions. 

I've noticed that there's an end statement/inequality/equation that you want to reach by the end of your proof to say QED, and kind of ""forcing"" your initial statement/inequality/equation to end up looking like it but it's so hard to know what method to use. 

Do I want to prove the contrapositive? Do I want to disprove the negation? What proposition do I need to use? Do I try to make the RHS equal the LHS or vice versa?"

You can do it and still pass pretty easily as long as you're motivated. You get a lot of free time this way but you'll have nightmares about it for the rest of your life. Like I'm a grown ass man but once a month I'll have a nightmare about having an exam for a class I never attended and forgetting to study for it lmao."
"Please, do not think your dad or mom would want you to push through. Talk you your dad. Tell him exactly what you told us. And I’m sure he’ll be more than understanding that you’ll need the term off. 

Secondly, Talk to your academic advisor and perhaps counselling. You’ve already mentioned how you’ve missed many classes. And how your very behind. I know your mind is telling you that you may have a chance at passing the term but the reality is you most likely won’t. I highly recommend taking the term off. The academic advisor will be able to wipe this term off your record.

I’m very sorry for your loss. 
Take a much needed break to gather yourself.

There's also scientific support for the lack of free will. The brain makes an unconscious choice before you're even aware of it. [[1]](https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080411/full/news.2008.751.html) [[2]](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080414145705.htm)

The VP Education did advocate to the school - the school mentioned they conduct regular testing, and that they have not received complaints from staff members in the building in the past 20 years.

The Safety Office mentioned they would conduct tests *if* a student officially files a complaint to the University.

"Well grats on the decent marks! �� Chocolate is an interesting catalyst for improvement - whatever works! ��

Oh cool! Who else recommended it if you don't mind exposing them (if not and you want to keep anonymity that's cool Reddit can be spooky) We need more players who aren't in science/math/cs to answer history/literature/language questions lol ��

Unfortunately no we just chatted for 30 minutes. He was from South Korea and was returning in a week or so of our conversation. He showed me his homework and it was overall very high quality for somebody who was just learning English! His pendmanship was pretty much better than mine ��

Thats neat! I may give that a go next term!"
"Ranking in a specific course seems feasible, not so much ranking against everyone who's in the same term as you even within the same course. The engineers can do it since each cohort takes mostly the same courses together. 

There's a lot more combination of majors/specializations you can take in math. Is it feasible to normalize the difficulty of all courses so that the overall ranking is an accurate reflection of a student's standing? Are you including the CS students who are in the Math faculty but take vastly different courses starting in second year? I think a ranking by program is more feasible, which is how the Engineering faculty does it by cohort and TAV, but even then Honors Math literally branches into a dozen or so majors/specializations. What about the programs that are more course restrictive like DD or FARM? They say you do better in things you actually like, so would it be fair to compare students with electives vs no electives?"
"SF has really great weather all-year, such that you can spend a lot time hiking, walking, biking, and if you're into skiing, Tahoe is just a 4 hour drive away. I haven't interned in NYC, but I've been there in the summer - it's hot and humid and is basically 10x downtown Toronto but with more vibrancy.

And yes SF has one neighbourhood where there are needles, homeless people, and feces (the Tenderloin and maybe sketchy parts on SoMa), but for some reason the media makes it seem like that's the whole city (actually go to NYC so that there'll be less housing demand here). 

The rest of the city (ie. the Sunset, Richmond, NoPa, Forest Hill, Castro, Noe Valley, Marina, Mission south of 18th...) is just so great to live in - there are lots of local businesses (ie. not chains at every block like Toronto) along with parks (with amazing views) and pretty decent transportation options (takes less than 30 minutes to downtown by transit from most of SF)."
"The way University Av built, it's a compromise between vehicles, pedestrians, transit, and cyclists with no plans to improve anything. My suggestion for improving the whole corridor would be 1 lane per direction and a centre left turn lane with roundabout intersections (to relieve vehicular congestion), bus stop lay-bys so cars can get around them, protected cycling lanes off the road, and pedestrian crossing islands in the centre of the roadway for safer crossing than what we have now.

The 2+2 default lane layout from the 1950s is what I really hate because cars queue when someone turns left or right and vehicles wait forever to turn out of side streets. It's a matter of time before delays and collisions could warrant installing signals at Lester.

If it was a ""traffic corridor"" then it would be rebuilt as a 70 km/h arterial with median, barriers, pedestrian bridges like those in Europe but clearly the region doesn't have that budget! 

And if it was an ""active transportation"" route it would be 30 km/h two lanes with speed bumps and roundabouts that are safer for pedestrians and cyclists just saying.

PS I'm not a traffic engineer yet, but I was a pedestrian and driver in the area of question."
"Of those four options, rebrand&gt;status quo&gt;lease&gt;franchise for me.

But, I don't understand why a bomber can't be profitable as it is, or with minor modifications. The presentation posted earlier this term showed that the deficit has ballooned (think it was doubled) in the last several years. Shouldn't looking at that be the priority? What's changing that it's not just unprofitable, but becoming rapidly more so with time.

Another unconventional idea is just remodelling the space honestly. The bombshelter is literally a hole in the wall in a dingy corner inside SLC and it's probably the furthest it can be from opening and inviting. It's no more obvious than the stairs to the other FEDS services upstairs. That never made sense to me.

But, of the options presented that's the preference I have. The potential benefits to a profitable student owned and ran restaurant/pub on campus are obvious. God knows I've heard enough from my parents and relatives ranting and raving about how much better it was 2/3 decades ago. The revenue source for FEDs is also attractive. And ideally I wouldn't want that being shared or siphoned off by international franchised restaurant corporations. The leasing of the space to a local business is the second worst of the bad options for that reason. And I don't think adding another franchised restaurant is that smart when there's so much all over campus already and there will be so much more with the SLC-PAC expansion."

"The video may focus on climate science, but the issue was not restricted to climate science, science more generally was spun, cut, funded, etc, based on the narrative the CPC wanted to spin. Government scientists weren't allowed to speak with media without government prior approval, and that involved mountains of red tape.

&amp;#x200B;

The Harper government was straight up anti science, unless it fit their agenda, climate science just took centre stage in that problem because his agenda required development of the oil sands.

"&gt; Fuck upper years who tell you that you're going to do badly; it's the opposite of what they should be saying

Yeah absolutely nobody here is saying that. The common sentiment is that grades *typically* drop 10% to 20% when going from highschool to University, which is **not** saying that it's going to happen, or that students will do badly. In fact it isn't even the opinion of 'upper years' that this happens, it's [objective fact that students coming to Waterloo Engineering from highschool on average see a 16% grade decrease](https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/). We can likely assume a similar principle applies to the Math faculty, and others.

I do agree with your sentiment however, people are capable of getting fantastic grades, and the only thing stopping people from achieving these grades is themselves. Let's just not pretend that 'upper years' are advocating for mediocrity because it's inevitable or something, because that isn't happening, at least not on this subreddit.

Edit: I'll concede that after putting further thought into this topic, it's definitely a very real sentiment amongst students here. I'd argue my statement stands on this subreddit however, I really haven't seen people declaring that this grade drop will absolutely happen for all incoming students. This thread, while only a single example, doesn't seem to have any of that despite being a prime location for people to discuss this."
"I did two undergrads at Waterloo - Stats (BMath) and Econ (BA).

Fill out this form:

https://uwaterloo.ca/forms/undergraduate-studies/sites/ca.forms.undergraduate-studies/files/uploads/files/application-for-readmission_2.pdf

I'd talk to an advisor though before you submit. Usually they will talk you through the process and make sure it really is in your best interest to do a second degree. When I applied for ECON, the advisor wanted to know what my life goals were and why I wanted to do another undergrad degree. Actually at the time I wanted to do law school LMAOOOOOO but I got pretty gud at econ so I stuck with it. For my case the advisor didn't really care about my grades as much (and my grades were complete ass), but the reasoning for doing another degree was really important. I was actually accepted over the phone (filling out the form was just paperwork and a formality)... but I suspect CS is harder to get into given how competitive it is.

What you should also think about is how long you're going to be in school. For me, ECON was a great choice because there's a lot of overlap (I got 20 credits, so I only had to do 20 more - just two years). CS and AFM don't have as much overlap, and you'd likely have to redo some of the math courses (because arts math is just not enough in terms of difficulty and content). Second degrees are pretty b ig commitments IMO... and while all your friends are going out to the work force, you have to understand that you will be in school (kinda feels like a victory lap year but imagine multiple...).

But if you ask me, a second undergrad was the best thing ever to happen to me. 

let me know if you have more questions, my answer is kind of all over the place

funny thing is though if you're taking regular level 1st year math courses, it is possible for you to not understand any of the theory and explanation that the profs teach during lectures (I sure as hell didn't) and you'll still be perfectly fine for the exams and assignments cause all their explanations are just summed up in a theorem or definition that you can memorize to use"
"Replace ""white"" with an exclusive ""our"" and I would definitely agree with the 14 words. There's nothing wrong with putting your family and children first. Plus, socialists are far closer to Nazi's than most people who the media would brand as white nationalists: Nazism was inherently expansionist, conformist, and socialistic (National Socialism); most white nationalists are protectionist, live-and-let-live, with a firm belief of self-actualization. Branding farther ""right-wing"" people as Nazis is nothing more than a ""left-wing"" smear in an attempt to distract from the fact that they are the ones who demand that you (in a conformist manner) define yourself beyond what is in your day-to-day life.

"There are lots of reasons why the FedS Executive team should be paid. It's consistent with other student unions across Canada, it allows the Executive team to focus on the Federation, it provides an easy route for accountability (if we pay the exec, they're bound to us by contract). It can be frustrating seeing the Executive being paid for their efforts when there are a lot of volunteer positions within the Federation, especially at the Society level. However, the FedS Exec work ***HARD*** for the Federation, and they put in a lot of hours.

"You can go to the hospital for whatever you want, especially if it’s outside normal hours. That being said, if you do choose to go to the hospital you’d probably have to wait quite a while as it’s not immediately life-threatening.

"Also, if you want more info, I recommend the TV show ""The Pickup Artist"", hosted by Mystery himself. Very entertaining, and a cool introduction to the PUA culture with very easy-to-digest info. I believe there are 2 seasons.

If you want more of a history on how PUA culture came to be, read ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss. Don't use it as a textbook because the advice is very outdated. It is however, a very interesting biographical account and really shows the inner weaknesses of the seemingly ""perfect"" PUAs, and the toxicity (as well as the good things) of PUA culture.

If you want a good, strong guide, the most up-to-date and high-quality one IMO is ""Game"" by Roosh V. He released it just a few months ago. He promptly got banned by Amazon and Shopify because our world is full of too many pussies who can't handle opposing opinions. You can buy an e-book version from his website.

She can always take another term to boost her marks or something, or do better in the finals to pull her average up. Is it going to be difficult? Sure. Might it end up being costly? Absolutely.

Turns out that there are so many other universities that get me to nearly or exactly the same place as UW would, contrary to what she explained to me.

She's nice enough, but I wouldn't trust much that she says since almost everything she told me was wrong"
"Not having an Education section is probably going to be fine while you're still a UWaterloo student but afterwards employers care what school you went to. A resume looks like it's missing something without even just a one liner on your program and how long your undergrad was. You're right that 4-5 is pushing it. Lean more towards the 4. Try to only include relevant things obviously. Don't try and hit that number if you don't have anything valuable to say. Honestly if you have a lot that you want to include in your resume tailor each resume to the job your applying for. Carefully read what skills, traits they are looking for and then go back into your resume and write each bullet point to match up."
"I think the issue you need to acknowledge first and foremost is why you believe that you should only exercise to impress other people.

I think what's most important is to love yourself first. Do things to help you grow as a person first.

At the end of the day, people come and go, but your stuck with yourself for the rest of your life, so why not be the best person you can be for yourself?

I think the sole reason why you don't feel much different or feel much happier is because you have set an impossible standard - that society has set for us - for yourself that no human can ever reach.

I promise you that you will be much happier if you stop comparing yourselves to others, and one way you can help limit this is by limiting your time on social media apps like Instagram where people seem to always be happy and have this perfect life and they need false validation through the number of likes they receive. But the reality is, they are not happy. And Instagram is an outlet for them to escape from their reality, and escape from their problems, rather than actually fixing their problems and their unhappiness.

Remember, there is no such thing as 'being good enough'.

There is only truth.

Be your truth."

"Depends on the course really.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll find that some courses the notes are basically the exact same as the lectures which is fine. Others however cover more in lectures than in notes. Often you have lectures that go over examples that aren't in the notes which makes it very beneficial to go to lectures. Others might not have notes at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Each term I'd recommend attending the lectures for a week or two to get a feel for how the courses are presented. Then decide which ones would be beneficial for you to skip or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone learns best in different ways so it's really hard to say but I'd definitely say it's worth experimenting if you feel it might help."
"I've been in town for almost a decade you dumb dildo, long enough to have seen the entire LRT construction from a more informed perspective than *stupid fucking highscooler who doesn't know their asshole from their elbow*. Workers didn't ""misjudge"" distances; tolerances at stops are measured in mms and a few of them had to have curb edges redone. Hardly major work, and accounted for in both construction budgeting and timelines. 

Well supported argument; I'm sure your completely anecdotal and subjective experience of walking around in the winter in K-W as a stupid asshole highschooler is pretty universal and more reliable than the tritag study.

In short; fuck yourself in the ear, uninformed moron."
"Midterms are often returned in-class by the professors and the marks get posted on your learn grades section/crowdmark/etc. Final exam grades typically don't get posted on learn and the only way to see them is to either reverse engineer your exam mark from your final mark and other marks, or go see your exam at the end of the term during the exam viewing period. Although typically by that time you will never want to think of exams again and just won't bother. The other answers here that talk about names being posted are obviously joking, since your name should never be tied to your mark. At most the prof could post a sheet with student numbers instead, but in my experience most profs don't bother. "
"My advice would be to look at different schools and what their research areas are. If you want to do grad school you will need to find someone doing something related to be a supervisor. Once you find someone you could contact them and ask for advice. You could also go on LinkedIn and find people in industry and see what they did, or go to a job search site and find a job you want and see what they ask for as qualifications. I would imagine that renewable energy is more of an industry than a job title, so there are probably people in the industry doing very different stuff. You could for example do electrical, computer, mechanical, chemical, etc research but focus on renewable energy applications. "
"this guy who lied on his AIF and tells other people that they should lie on their AIF because 'UW doesn't fact check' now has the gall to tell the same people who didn't make up awards on their AIF his sob story about how awful his first coop was and how hard he worked to get a cali job in 2A? 

Personally, I don't find this motivating, in fact I find this absolutely infuriating, but maybe it's because I was also in the same boat as you in during my shitty first coop and I ended up spending a lot of it doing side projects and leet code and still didn't end up with a cali job or really any job that I wanted in 2A. Maybe I'd have a cali job too if I didn't have [morals](https://imgur.com/h4AYC2H.png)"
"&gt;  As such, I am curious as to how comparatively easy Western is to Waterloo, or even in general, in terms of Engineering.

Probably a bit easier since you won't always be on the hustle finding another internship, but the difference is that if you want to transfer you need to absolutely kill the marks game.

However, consider this: there's not a ton of programs which are unconditionally worth graduating. If you switch to Waterloo, you'll pragmatically be set back 2 years, since right know you're class of 2022, you'll become class of 2024 (since it's a five year program). 

On top of that, Western has internships reasonable enough, and while Waterloo Engineering is certainly good, the only programs that are particularly standing out are Nano, Tron, ECE, Arch, and SE (ok, so a few programs), and maybe SYDE/BME. 

Let me ask you - why do you want Waterloo Eng? I can give you more information on transferring, but I think you might want to reconsider."
"LinkedIn carries with it the odor of ""enterprise"", ""networking"", ""Microsoft"". Lyft is aggressively expanding and is just a cooler brand; it's the underdog in the battle with Uber, but is still very well-funded and honestly, the service is almost completely price elastic, so Lyft could easily replace Uber in the minds of consumers. 

Smaller companies (that are actual startups and not languishing in some weird purgatory of eternally ""starting up"") have a special kind of energy; people are happy to go to work.

Food is a good reason as any, but you will acclimate to it very quickly. The extra money you save doesn't really matter, to be honest, especially with the pay bump. 

I'm just speaking for myself here, anyway. 

Another argument is based on the assumption that Lyft is more selective, so if you had to pick one and attempt to work at the other later on, it'd be easier to retry and succeed at LinkedIn. 

/u/UWSE2019 can steelman LinkedIn, though. "
"When I took pmath 347, I failed my midterm and barley passed the course (67%, but if you are taking pmath major seriously I would say that's more likely a failure than okay mark). I also got disappointing marks for few other pmath courses. It took few terms to cope with those courses for me. But I worked harder even more and I did well on pmath 348 and pmath 441. The only course I really struggled with after 3A was first order logic (I admit that it's not for me). Now I just got a USRA position somehow
, so I guess it's not too bad to have few courses with low mark on your transcript. 

When I first started taking pmath courses, everything was too abstract for me and I even didn't properly understand what I'm learning. But if you love what you are learning and keep working hard, I think you would be fine. At least it's not the end of the world. Btw when I was in 2B, some upper year student told me avg of pmath students is close to 90. Is that true? "
"I think there is a consistent theme in your post, and it's that you have bad habits which seek immediate pleasures. Not saying you can't ever eat unhealthy, masturbate, and look at your phone, but too much of those habits are harmful to your long-term physical and mental health.

You can seek counseling, but I believe there are things you can do to help improve your situation: 

1. Exercise. Learn how to lift weights and learn how to run properly. You can search /r/fitness for some good advice on youtube channels for proper form and what exercises to do. 

2. Learn how to cook and eat healthy. There are many healthy food options at the grocery store that you just can't find at mr paninos or lazeez, it's also really cheap and fun once you get a legit recipe down and can meal prep for an entire week.

3. Listen to podcasts. It will keep you productive when not studying and prevent you from using your phone because you should be listening to it! 

4. Start decreasing your masturbation rate, try to work your way down to once per day, from there, you can keep progressing to 2-3x/week.

5. Set specific times for phone/internet use and also use a website blocker for porn and reddit so you can get shit done."
"Hey, hang in there. This happens to the best of us. During one of my co-ops, I felt exactly the same way as you. The team had a ""star"" co-op a few terms back who had completely changed the way a task was completed (for the better). His work was very well done (as I was using what he made), but it gave me a lot of pressure to perform. Similar to you, I don't think I pick things up as fast as some people. I need to do things slowly and perfectly first before picking up the speed. This approach in some working environments can be tough. I was in a high stress and time sensitive environment, so naturally it freaked me out. That led to self doubt and panic (and some crying after work). I screwed up a lot in the beginning to the point where one of my co-workers actually told me that my work was a mess. So, you are already in a better position than me. :) What I did is really put in the time and effort. There were days when I left the office at 10pm. Eventually, after around 2 months, I got the hang of it, and everything was fine. No one really remembered how bad I was in the beginning. Also, I suggest you to not compare yourself to the old co-op. You also don't know how much work they have put in. For instance, for my job, I later found out that some of the past coops have also worked late and on weekends (so I wasn't the only one putting in extra time). Obviously, that might not apply to your job, but that doesn't mean you can't put in the extra time. Ultimately, stop comparing (it will drive you crazy and make you extremely unfocused) and put in more time. A lot of people struggle in new environments. It's just not something that everyone likes to talk about, so you are definitely NOT alone. Good luck! :) "

"Alright I'll be waiting. I won't go back on my word... That is my ninja way!

And cool. I guess that is the kinda thing that's hard to make money off of, and works well as a hobby for most people."
"Alum here.  If this is what profs are doing these days it is shameful.  That is not a quiz worth 10% and barely, barely relevant to the course.  The chem chair should be made aware of this matter."
And I think it's really cool that someone actually likes reading anything I write. I enjoy reading your comments as well because you're always reasonable even when people are disagreeing with you.
Apparently a lot of people have slipped during winter and had to redo the term because they were too injured to continue. Hope you all have good gripping shoes and you consider your safety first..
"Depends what company. They can have 2 motives: Either they only want to give offers to students they know will accept them, or they are going to give you an offer but want to try to undersell you."

"I'm in second year, but thanks for the suggestion, haven't heard of that yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't think I'll inquire about that route since it would involve not getting Osap or survivor benefits."
I'm just kinda scared because the slides the prof has put out don't really have much content. I don't know if the course is just that easy or I'm missing a lot just by missing out on the lectures.
"Just checked Quest. I had a term where I had a &lt;32 mark. The term average on my transcript was calculated using the raw mark, not 32%. This is in an engineering program. Sorry for the bad news."
"Just stop reserving seats.

I get that you can't even comprehend why it would make us angry, but it does. So stop, or you will just keep having Canadians get mad at you. 

Ahhhhhh assimilation... "

"They will lose hundreds of million of dollars in funding from the US Dept of Energy if they don't sue. This is a tough position for UWaterloo. It's either lose reputation, or lose tons of funding."
Would you say the slides he shows in class are indicative of what he teaches or does he heavily expand on what the slides say (as in the slides barely cover a fraction of the material he teaches)?

"they told us during dinner that they'll send you a survey for team matching after you accept the offer

as for which table I sat at during the dinner I think it'd give too much away about who I am"
"Each term, I usually have 2-3 of the same classes with my friends in the same program since there's more freedom in timing of courses (some ppl like speeding through required courses and some prefer spreading them out with electives). Since we have 4 coop sequences, each term there might only be a handful of students for more niche programs. I don't think it'd be very meaningful to rank by program. I'd be interested in a ranking for classes though "
"I attempted to kill myself after the rape. Not because I had started smoking weed, but because I hated my body and the fact that someone had just taken away my rights to it. I was depressed and so scared. It had nothing to do with the weed.

I think you're failing to see that they may have been self-medicating existing depression (you really can't ever know - some of my closest friends never knew about my suicide attempts or mental health issues). "
"Yes. It's been a bit of a struggle to get to where I am, and it's a bit of a vindication to go to convocation. Also, at this point I'm probably the only one of my cousins on both sides to get a degree, so it's even more important, especially for my paternal grandparents, who would want to see the one grandchild they have going to university graduate, but are too old to make the trip out to see it. Getting graduation pictures for them is a priority."
"sometimes, fortunately not anymore

"So basically what we are thinking is to have people show up at the regular time, 7pm. MC 2054. Those who want to play in the main tournament are more than welcome. Those who would like to join our group tutoring can do so.  The point is to teach the game. It is free. I will teach the basic strategy and fundamentals and nail it down to a tee. We will answer any questions. And then if people are ready we can go into some advanced strategy/math that is crucial to winning players. The truth is that poker is an extremely fun game. Both recreationally and for serious players. But its got a lot of highs and lows. Its a lot like chess. If you like a challenge and want to learn come by and we will teach you."
"had a private music teacher for about 6 years in piano, it helps to have a teacher but honestly you could really do it just through youtube if you're dedicated enough. Piano in my opinion is one of the easier instruments to learn, especially when you begin.

you really do need a physical piano, but you can ""practice"" without one doing drills and stuff, just buy a shitty 2/3 keyboard from kijiji or something for ~$50, I would highly recommend against buying a $500 piano when you're starting out unless you have the money to spare. A pretty large majority of music does not require the keys on either extremity unless you're planning on playing classical music, also weighted keys literally do not matter."

Do you happen to find people of particular races uglier? That's usually the only pattern I see in terms of friend groups. Some people (especially international students) tend to keep to themselves.
"Hmm currently it is my average .. however it will improve. I have not been studying for any tests, cos this time i will ace my exams and get an easy weight flip. Again, expect me next year buddy :3"
I doubt an engine code reader will be very helpful. Most squeals come from belts. So if I were you I would check the serpentine belt or any other belts you can find and check the condition of them.

"Hey /u/the_biblioholic this is a fantastic question! 

So science for a few years now has maintained competitive elections! I really try to hammer home elections, inform people in and around the Science Society, and then try to encourage people to run.

"People in their late teens and early twenties tend to be pretty narcissistic. That’s not really unique to Waterloo though it can be exacerbated when people are pursuing high salary fields.

If you’re interested in your classmates helping people ask yourself are you volunteering to help others? There are plenty of opportunities on campus. It’s better to do your part and lead by example than decry that the people sitting beside you don’t care."
"Theoretically the rate of burning varies across the length of the log, i.e. the first half might burn slightly faster than the second half - but it all will be burned in 60 seconds (or 30 if you light from two ends).

The actual answer is close to your current solution, though. Very close. "

"I have pretty solid arguments about both the key deposit and cleaning fee. Just to be clear, they didn't take the cleaning fee as part of the deposit. They took it on top of it. 

I can tell you about my arguments against both the key deposit and cleaning fee privately. But I'm confident that I can still argue against them despite the agreement, not even having to dispute the argument which I'm sure isn't enforceable anyway. 

&gt; I believe kw4rent may send cleaning fee to collection and they may ruin your credit score even if there are no evidence regarding to the cleaning fees

I paid the cleaning fee because I couldn't risk damaging my credit score to be honest. Doesn't mean I won't fight back.

"Okay, so you actually have 24 hours after the midterm time to present a VIF to your professor. But, you're supposed to email the professor before the midterm itself and tell them that you're working to get a VIF. If you're sick, you're sick. Go to the clinic and get one. Especially for midterms, it's very very very unlikely that they won't accept your VIF.

Some doctors at Health Services are weird (if you chose to go there on Monday) and a nurse there actually told me that you have to straight up tell them that you want x amount of days off, so they put that on the VIF, instead of just giving you the one day. Just advocate for yourself, and tell them all of your symptoms and how it's affecting you. "
"The giant paragraph roughly means:

Last class, we (the girls) saved couple seats, and this man threw his bag onto one of the seats and jumped over the table to take that seat. He was saying the bad things including the ""F-word"" while we didn't say anything. We didn't want to escalate the situation so we chose to ignore him. Later when his friends arrived, he started flaming us again loudly. One of the girls said ""I feel offended"" to him, but he replied ""go back to china f*** I don't care your are offended, I am a Chinese but I was born in Canada. After class, we approached him to ask why he did this. We didn't use any offending words, we were really polite and wanted to ask him why. Before we even speak, he said ""come on, yell to me, it's not gonna do anything"". Then we said ""if you don't want to deal with this in a good way, we have no choice but seek help from the Dean"" He seemed scared a bit and said ""let's go outside and talk about this"". He then intentionally went to a corner near the bathroom to make others think we are abusing him. He said he can't promise that he won't abuse Chinese, he won't stop saying ""go back to China"", nothing can be promised. He said he was not in a good mood and only said ""sorry"". Then, the prof was walking by, he suddenly changed his attitude and apologized and said he won't do this again. We feel like he didn't really mean to apologize, to protect our right, we decided to report this incident to needle's hall. The adviser from needle's hall asked the prof what's the name of that student, the prof said didn't know. Today, the prof said if there's any conflict, go talk to him. We think his response is really vague, he didn't even talk about this incident (racist insulting). The man was smelling, after class we thought this already passed, but he jumped over a table and rushed to one of the girl (The girl didn't even talk to him last class) and then said ""yo watch out"". We feel like he is threatening us. Now it's close to midterm season, we are all really busy, we don't want anyone to hate CBC (Canada born Chinese) because of this. We just want the school to take this incident seriously. We don't want anyone experience this kind of incident while the school is already hard.

"sorry for the really late reply u/kw4004 (you are the real u/kw2002 right?). Ngl sometimes I get anxious even replying to comments on reddit and so I kinda put it off :(

&gt; but here on reddit, ok i know sounds cheesy, but I can get insight into you and you can get insight into me. THat's why I post some crazy shit sometimes, not because im hunblebragging or making shit up, but because it's nice to build a bridge.

Yeah that's exactly how I feel when I read people's comments, I like getting little insights into their personalities and experiences and sometimes learning stuff about other people even helps me learn more about myself. Yeah I never really felt like you were humble bragging, you're narratives were interesting and reading them made me feel as if I was experiencing part of a completely different life. 

&gt; I can tell by the spirit of your words here, that you extend that white dove, that initiative that makes the world a better place.

aww thanks :)

&gt; Sadly, that capacity aligns with corporate goals who aim to exploit us, much as the grand daddys who pay me 150 EUR, but I propose this idea: that we are so clever, that we can rise above that, and make the world a better place.

You're close to graduation right? What are your plans? Is this something you give a lot of thought to? I used to have grand dreams, but now I'm not so sure what I'll do. Personally I don't know if I'll be able to do anything amazing, but I don't know if I think that's necessary. I think that even if you work for some corporation, where the work isn't very meaningful, you can still help our your community in small ways, and even that's worthwhile. Plus you could use some of that corporate money you made to do good, maybe it's not ideal, but it's not the worst thing in the world.

"To add on to other people's points, there is also the difference of taking 52 courses vs 40 courses with one less coop and one more study term if you're in DD. So you're forced to overload or take courses on coop at least twice to graduate on time. It's also mandatory to overload in 1B to satisfy the English requirement.

DD is busier, what with the weekly math assignments and term long business group projects and juggling classes between the two schools. Diverging from your question though, I'd have to argue that the quality of teaching you receive will be different. Despite how much we meme on Laurier, they are better equip to teach business as a university with a business school. DD at the end of the day is math AND business where it's mandatory to take accounting, HR, marketing classes etc. to satisfy BBA requirements, while the single degree is math + sprinkles of business classes with more focus on the former since that's what Waterloo excels at."
"Fallacy of relative privation. Those other bigger problems in the world, which are supposedly bigger than the integrity of the fucking planet, bear no relevance to the initial argument and continues your trend of whataboutism. 

As for Harper, it wasn't just environmental and fiscal issues that did him in. During his last year in office he passed and attempted to pass a high number of controversial bills that Canadians for the most part did not agree with. The anti-terrorist bill that gave overwhelming spying powers with no oversight. The ability to strip Canadian's of their citizenry. Open-ended statements about who could be terrorists. Fighting constantly with the supreme court when he couldn't keep powers he wanted in the PMO office. All the way down to calling the Constitution a straight jacket preventing him from making the changes he deemed were ""best for Canada"".

Harper's legacy is not a good one. And it amazes me today how many people yell and scream that Trudeau is ""ruining Canada"" without really being able to reinforce why they say that, but completely ignore everything Harper was trying to do our country.

But arguing with some unempathetic shitposter is futile, go back to assassins creed

"It would be tremendously helpful and effective if we as a community just included others more in social events, especially those who currently don't get included often.

The big issue here is that no one is obligated to be socially inclusive, nor should they be obligated. I'd love it if people asked me to hang out with them more (or at all), but no one owes me that.

Similarly, it would be great if the community as a whole were more socially inclusive, but no one is entitled to anyone's kindness let alone friendship.

There's a conflict here between people's right to exclude whoever they want from their friend group, and the tremendous negative effect being socially excluded has on one's mental health."
"Hello friend, thank you for sharing. It must have been really difficult to muster up the courage to post this.

I'm really glad that you really seem to be thinking through your thoughts and emotions, and figuring yourself out. It sounds like a pretty tough journey for you these past few years. 

A lot of what you're saying makes sense, but I don't think it's necessary to strictly define when what you're experiencing becomes a mental illness per se, or when it's just a big reaction to pressures from school and life. From my experience when we try to shove these kind of things into neat little boxes, we neglect remedies or things that may help us as a result of over-analysis and categorizing things too strictly. After all, depressive episodes can be triggered by stress or pressures, and I definitely think those two can go hand in hand.

I think you could benefit from seeing a professional, especially now when you're in a place where everything is not catastrophically falling around you. It helps a lot to seek help when you're able, even if you feel like you might not need it in the future, because when you're back in the mess of things it's a lot harder to reach out.

Personally I think what's at the root of the issue is how you approach your worth and values in life. This might sound tough or philosophical but I believe that if we think that we need to perform well in life in order to have worth, we will always be let down eventually. If you can start thinking and believing that you are loved and approved of regardless of how you do in school or your success in life, you won't enter that vicious cycle of struggling to perform and the anxiety to perform that comes with it.

"All of what you've said is true to the best of my knowledge, although I'd like to raise a few points. And I really don't embryonic selection based on IQ is a good idea, that's a huge Pandora's box. IQ is also not a perfect test by any means. While it is an okay predictor of success, it's far from a direct correlation. Different groups also score differently on different parts of the test; Ashkenazi Jewish people score higher on verbal and mathematics but lower on spatial awareness. Any solution based on a single metric for humans is bound to fail since our brains are just way too complicated.

As for the racial IQ gap, it's either largely or completely socioeconomic. In America, until just 50 years ago, it was literally illegal for black people to go to the same schools as whites or to eat in the same restaurants as whites. As a result of being forced to live in poorer neighbourhoods, black families were unable to build up value in real estate, which is the primary source of wealth for lower and middle-class families. By 2013, white households had an average of 656k in household wealth whereas black people have just 85k. Since American schools are funded by property taxes, wealthy, predominantly white neighbourhoods get better funded schools than their poor counterparts. This is a reason cited for why the Head Start program seems to wear off, as the additional education is not reinforced effectively in school. Here's a [lengthy piece](https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/RacialWealthGap_1.pdf) detailing the racial wealth gap if you want to read more.

As a quick aside, generally, when I hear people come out and say ""black people have a low IQ"" it usually precedes a really racist comment, but I'm glad you haven't done that.

Finally, even if it's true that controlling for all factors shows that black people have a lower IQ on average, there's no ethical argument to deny the humanity of others solely because of their race. When we say black people have a lower average IQ without having a deep understanding of the whole issue, in a way we're explicitly or implicitly assuming that we are somehow better than a whole class of people based on something (race) that is completely out of our control."
"- I really like the template or design of this resume. It's clear and the use of color is great
- Consider turning the sentences in your education section into bullet points. It currently looks a bit off since everything else is in bullet point form
- Typically for resumes you use past-tense for your verbs so I would rewrite the beginning of each of your bullet points. This is an important one.
- Are L1 and L2 common things in your field? Will recruiters know what it is without needing to Google? If not, then I would write it out or explain
- For your work as a research assistant at the university can you maybe include a bullet point about the impact of your work? I.e. why was it relevant, what were you trying to achieve, did you achieve it, is it impressive?
- What tools/programs did you use to run statistical analyses on SPSS data sets? Also what were you trying to accomplish with this?
- Did you use any special tools or programs for your monthly and annual survey result reports? If so, I would expand here
- ""Set up laboratory equipment"". Are there specific pieces of equipment that you can list here to provide a bit more detail? Anything you can name drop to help you land a job, in other words.
- How did you design a research and data collection methodology as a research intern? This seems vague and probably isn't doing your hard work justice
- Which tools/programs were used for video editing and making infographics? I.e. photoshop.
- What was the end result of your systematic review of ethical implications of open access publishing? Did you end up presenting this? Did you have a positive effect on your work place because of it?
-  ""Collaborate with the executive team"". Collaborate is a tricky word on resumes. It doesn't exactly show what you did and while teamwork is an important skill to highlight, the recruiter won't know how much work you did in the collaboration. They might assume you did the minimum and just tacked your name on it. Instead try to re-write this bullet point to focus exactly on what you did. I.e. ""Planned and coordinated...""
- For the Student Leaders Colloquium, what did you have to do to be chosen? Lead a project? Write a paper? Have good marks? Make sure you explain how and why you got it.
- As a side point if you're talking about the ancient Aztec language, I believe it is spelled Nahautl not Nahualt.

Also, a few words of advice (from someone who has stayed up to study and slept through before): if you can, sleep is often more valuable than studying. Having a rested mind plays a huge role in recalling information, critical thinking, and making connections. Also, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation (hopefully not), email the prof immediately, be honest, and then try find the prof in person as fast as possible."

"It's hard to see the link between student mental health/suicides and the breadth requirements.

It's also not really tactful to write an essay on why the course you are currently taking is shit, for the course itself. Essay writing is not just about throwing out whatever ideas you think are cool. they require some tact. For example, I can't go about writing an essay on why Africa is a shithole and deserves poverty in an international development course."

"Yup, definitely agree that ECE is too cramped. The coordinators should've balanced ECE physics courses a bit better. Looking at the courses for ECE it gets pretty cramped during 2B? Maybe they could've pushed a course or two taken in a semester to a later semester to make room for a physics course(Lots of space in 4A for ECE courses). Making the two physics courses taken before less cramped. But Im sure they have a method to their madness, ECE is tough!"
"Dear /u/jasfir3932138219,

Thank you for applying to the University of Toronto. We appreciate your interest in our institutions, but we are unable to give you an offer to Studies in Computer Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science on the St. George campus.

The University of Toronto receives many strong applications year after year and it is always a difficult decision that is based on a variety of factors. Unfortunately, we do not have enough resources to accept every applicant into this program.

I would suggest contacting Ryerson University as they have more lenient admissions requirements. I wish you the best of luck on your endeavors.

Sincerely,

Admissions Committee of the University of Toronto"
"&gt;Look, people who are in actual immediate danger of hurting themselves, ACTUALLY KILL THEMSELVES.

You realize there's a progression to that point, right?

Hurting yourself doesn't always mean suicide attempts, it can also be self-mutilation. In any case, if you feel it coming over you, you absolutely should call campus police or 911. Campus police can help other emergency personnel navigate campus more successfully anyways if they're not acquainted. 

You can sense when your mind is heading to a bad place, and can hopefully take steps to prevent a spiral. This victim-blaming, invalidating, dismissive behaviour towards someone who is not in a great place is disgusting, and you've done it before looking at your post history. For someone who claims to understand human behaviour, it's ironic as hell. But I'm guessing by human behaviour, you mean some retarded ""redpill"" philosophy.

"When I say ""definite improvements"", what I really mean is minimal administration. Local politicians have been wasting funds on things we don't need so they can justify their pointless jobs, especially in Kitchener-Waterloo, and I'm tired of that. The transit ""improvements"" in the form of the LRT, Go train, etc. are not \*definite\* by any means. It's pretty clear that they'll lead to reduced safety, traffic congestion, and will have low ridership. That's beyond all the problems in the construction plan they had, which has required numerous rebuildings at points and which has been a shitshow in securing the trains themselves. As for snow removal, there's absolutely no issue with that at the moment. People need to just act safe and give drivers a little more room for error when the roads are slick. Clearing sidewalks etc. are the homeowner's responsibility, and if you're not a lazy ass it's really not a big deal. Certainly not an issue to campaign over. Beisan's platform is nothing but trendy bullcrap, from her ideas about public festivals and the Ezra street thing to her ideas about what constitutes a good transportation plan. At least if we brought in the billyclubs and water cannons to hose down the Ezra-street degenerates it would be for the cause of law. That's an expenditure I'm willing to pay for. And her claim that ""*the better the public transit, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure there is, the less congestion and gridlock we’ll experience*"" is just a total fallacy: anybody who's been in Waterloo region since before the construction started can tell you that. I think her appeal to students is to get out-of-towner ignoramuses voting for her, who don't know the history of the town's mismanagement. "

"Literally the only allegation that would make it sexual assault was the ""hand over her mouth"" part (unless I'm thinking of the wrong allegation). As for pretty much the rest of it, you can't let things escalate and then expect things to immediately stop, and if you do expect immediate 100% wind-down you can say goodbye to whatever relationship you had because that's fucking cold. 

Edit: without the hand over mouth part it's the Patrick Brown fiasco all over again, because what he did was definitely not sexual assault and consensual sexual congress between two relatively equally drunk people is not rape. If the woman isn't capable of understanding the situation and giving ""real"" consent, then the man isn't capable of understanding the situation and recognizing that consent isn't ""real"" consent.The only good thing about that situation is it revealed that Brown is a spineless pussy who is incapable of standing up straight when things don't go 100% his way.

"Talk to your academic advisor IMMEDIATELY about your options. If you fail a term it will basically be impossible to transfer. If you drop out now you might be able to get all if not some of your tuition back. Maybe you can take a gap year to figure out what you like or what you really want to do? You might even be able to defer your term to next year if you decide to come back. Another option is to do a non degree term which is basically a term where you take whatever courses you want. This can help you if you want to transfer to other faculties etc. 

At the end of the day even if a job is really safe, stable, well paying etc it's not worth it if you hate your life and hate yourself. Also ECE does not guarantee you good coops. You'll still need side projects etc. Programming jobs have the lowest barrier to entry so you could definitely do an unrelated major and still get a programming job.

Please consider your options before you're trapped. I wish I did."
"Might be too late this year, but you can certainly build up your skills in the meanwhile to prepare for next year! Here is Waterloo's site for competitive programming - http://acm.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~acm00/
  
There was a Fall Local Contest (individual) on campus September 30th, and the North American Qualifier (work in small teams) October 6th. I don't remember all the details, so excuse me if I make a mistake, but I believe based on the NA Qualifier, uWaterloo gets to send a certain amount of teams (4 or 5?) to the next round, the ACM ECNA regional contest. I believe that these teams and its members are picked by UW's coach based on the results of the aforementioned two contests. Then, assuming Waterloo does well in this regional contest, one team of 3 is selected and sent to the world finals for ACM ICPC.  
   
Now, keep in mind that uWaterloo has very strong students, and it's no easy feat to be selected to be sent to the world finals (most often the students in the team already dedicated enormous amount of time and have acquired many skills, and probably already have IOI and/or IMO medals). However, I'm sure if you really put in the time you could make it to the regional round. 
  
A good way to get good at competitive programming is to frequently solve problems and participate in contests. [dmoj.ca](https://dmoj.ca) has a great repository of a 1000+ problems of various difficulty. [codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com) is a very popular site for contests that happen about weekly.  
  
**Note:** I'm by no means extremely knowledgeable in this topic as I've never done contests at uWaterloo and I'm not fantastic at competitive programming in general. Just a fan that learned this from other people :)

"One additional thought worth noting: the disciplinary actions that clause permits are all things which are normally in the University's sole jurisdiction and have never fallen under Policy 71. Policies 70-72 in general have always dealt with a fairly narrow category of student behaviour and disciplinary proceedings (most notably, those involving suspensions and expulsions), while tools like banning a student from campus or freezing their account has always existed outside of that for penalties not covered by those policies. Even when they are mentioned in policy, it's to insulate the executives' control over them (for instance, see the section of Policy 71 related to criminal proceedings against students)."

Even if you pitch a tent you always need something between the tent and the ground (people use mats, branches, leaves, etc).  

If you're sleeping outside you need to protect your feet first and foremost.  you need a sleeping bag that is graded for -10c weather, you need a tarp to keep you dry and block you from the wind (another killer) and you need to find somewhere secluded like a forested area among the trees and bush which will also help with blocking the wind."
"I get you, OP. It's like we want whatever we can't have, or wouldn't practically pursue even if we could. I get jealous of my single friends who hook up with whoever they want on the weekends, even though if I were single, I would still be afraid of intimacy with strangers and likely not feel true to myself if I were to hook up with randoms. I get jealous of people who turn down sleep and sacrifice school work to go out on a Wednesday night, but I know I would be grumpy and stressed if I lost sleep and got behind in my work. The grass is always greener. I also don't particularly like kids, but wow it'd be nice if my one true aspiration in life was to be a mom--then, no matter what else happens with my career goals, at least I'd always have that, right? I think it's just a daydream of all the different avenues I could've taken in my life but didn't and it's almost as if I fear I'm missing out in some fundamental life experiences. Idk girl. Brains are weird. "
"If the climate changes we can adapt. Specific ecosystems may be fragile, but nature is not that fragile. Worse case scenario is that a bunch of species go extinct (or more likely certain strains of species go extinct, and who cares if strains go extinct?). 

Blaming inevitable third world population displacement on a lack of environmentalism is beyond stupid. Third world countries are currently experiencing the population jackpot that the West and some Asian countries already experienced, a jackpot that results due to advanced agriculture and medicine which brings infant mortality way down and life expectancy way up. Most displacement from third world countries is going to result from them mismanaging their resources and failing to take advantage of their population boom, and possibly due to poorly planned war mongering by world powers attempting to consolidate their power. ""Climate change refugees"" is a farce, and blaming the inevitable conflict due to current demographic trends on the environment is beyond stupid, because the greatest threat in this century is trends which undermine current power structures and may spiral in a major (nuclear) conflict which could solve the management challenges caused by massive human population growth. The way I see it, the Western establishment realizes that the West is losing its dominance and things like this are a last ditch effort for them to maintain their power (fuck the people am i right) by attempting to exert soft influence over potential future powers. 

Also, assuming the change is mostly due to humans, there is no reason to believe that jumping onto the green agenda is going to make any difference. Humanity has been winning big for the last couple centuries, and it comes at a cost. I say the cost is probably acceptable, and the cost must be viewed through an anthropocentric lens. 

Edit 2: What we should be doing is improving planning (eg. don't build new stuff where flooding/etc is expect and slowly phase out existing infrastructure in those areas). All these grandoise ideas that scientists, lawyers, media, etc seem to have these days seem to be based on taking Rawl's Veil of Ignorance to the extreme: basically they think of people as blank replaceable objects. I hate to break it to them, but Rawl's Veil of Ignorance is not based in reality and treating it as a philosophy instead of an interesting thought experiment will lead to nothing good. 

TLDR; Militant environmentalism is nothing but an attempt to distract people from other divisions and attempt to build a one nation world, which I consider to be very undesirable and a threat to freedom and continued progress. 

TLDR EDIT: Basically, I believe that it is unlikely that any action the government takes will make any significant difference in climate change trends but I also believe that the actions the governments will take (based on past and proposed policies and actions) will have a very negative social impact. Therefore, I would rather do nothing because there is a reasonable probability that it will be fine and there is a high probability that action would make no environmental difference and there is a high probability that action would have very negative impacts on factors not relating to the environment.

Got the marks back, half the class failed as usual. And then she told us that the first year office wouldn't let her give us part marks. We too got fucked. She ended up letting us shift weighting to the final so that the midterm was worth either 10% or 0% (can't recall). I failed the midterm, got a high 80 in the course.

She seems to have a habit of promising things that she can't deliver."
"lol idk, I didn't play the older ones. but so far Odyssey is putting Origins to shame with its mechanics.

I feel like they tried to half-ass the RPG elements in Origins, and they've actually done them right in Odyssey.

"I would dispute 2 by proposing that the reverse correlation between gender equity index and number of women in stem is a result of progressive rhetoric being positively sexist (towards women, cause can't be sexist against men amir) and creating or reinforcing a male versus female tribal mindset. 

As for 3, that is very important when considering history and why men pretty much created all science (men building society, women building the home). As I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the men building society and women the home may be far less relevant today than it used to be because technology has largely negated the importance of physical strength and low infant mortality has reduced the investment of time by women to produce enough viable offspring to replace her and her partner. (Here I am assuming we have a replacement rate birth rate, because any society which does not will become increasingly irrelevant and cannot be defined as a successful project)"
"I'm in the exact same boat as you. I don't think that there has been a single MATH135 assignment that I have completed without going to the TAs for help or at least asking my friends. Similarly, I have been waiting for the solutions for the MATH137 assignments to come out before even attempting to solve it since I know that I won't be able to do it on my own.

I think the big thing to take away here is that there are others who are in the same situation as you and that you are not an outlier or dumb or anything. It's understandable that we don't get things immediately, it's our first term of university and we're busy trying to adapt to our new life and schedules.

Its easy to feel dumb when you compare yourself to others. I know that for me, personally, I feel sad when I have to even go to the tutoring centre because I feel like I should be able to do it on my own. But the thing is, the assignments are purposefully challenging to make you work harder to understand the concepts and how to apply them. Even though others may get it immediately, there is no problem with you needing some help to get to the answer. 

Use the fact that your friends understand it better than you to help you to answer the problems and learn the concepts. I know that if I understood something that my friend didn't, I would dedicate myself to helping them understand it too because that is what friends do. 

Considering that even upper-year students struggle with concepts that they learn in their classes, or that they used to struggle with these first-year courses too but are still on the path to completing their degree, just remember that there is hope.

It's awful that a TA would even say that to you and I would definitely mention it to someone because they are here to support you, not make you feel even worse. I commend you for taking the opportunity to try and improve by going to these tutors and asking your friends. It is not a sign of weakness and, if anything, it shows that you are going be the one to make it through because of your perseverance.

Honestly, as with any other math subject you might have had before, the best way to get better at understanding and learning the material is by practicing more and trying to get better at it. Try the MapleTA questions for MATH137, the warm-up/challenge questions for MATH135 and the textbook coding challenges for CS135. If you get stuck, go to an instructor or tutor with what you were able to come up with or ask for hints on which direction to take next. 

It's okay to feel overwhelmed and I definitely get where you are coming from. I'm still struggling and I don't think that I will be 100% ready by the end of this term but the important thing is that we are trying. You can also go to an academic advisor and talk to them about your experience and see what they recommend, as you are not the first to feel overwhelmed, especially in first year.

Feel free to PM me if you want to talk or even cry about assignments together, you're not in this alone."

"[A study from the University of Calgary (and affiliated organizations) suggests second-hand smoke can result in psychoactive effects. Nothing conclusive of third-hand smoke.](http://cmajopen.ca/content/5/4/E814.full)

From ""Results &gt; Psychoactive effects"":

&gt; These data indicate that active smokers and those exposed to second-hand smoke experience a similar pattern of intoxication; however, the latter consistently report weaker drug effects than active smokers.

From ""Interpretation"":

&gt; Second-hand exposure to marijuana smoke can lead to cannabinoid metabolites in bodily fluids sufficient for positive results on testing of oral fluids, blood and urine, and can lead to psychoactive effects. There is evidence of a weak dose-response relation between THC content of cannabis and effects on those exposed to second-hand smoke, including metabolites found in blood and urine, and psychoactive effects. There is evidence that the relation is mediated by environmental factors, including whether the air space is ventilated, volume of air, number of marijuana cigarettes lit at 1 time, potency of the marijuana and number of smokers.

That being said, I can't adequately summarize the results from different study environments the data was pulled from as it's a bunch of different results from multiple sources (including tests varying in ventilated/unventilated environments, THC content, etc). 

If I've misinterpreted this I will amend my comment. My personal take is since this is all would (hopefully) be happening outside and away from entrances it probably wouldn't be an issue, but the current group of cigarette smokers on campus already don't stay very far from building entrances as all of the signage suggests (10m). Furthermore, I'm not sure if the punishment for breaking the campus rules should be worse than tobacco.

I wonder what that was.

The student photographed the test and distributed it digitally to the other members of the class. ...

"Hey /u/Albereon I am not disagreeing with you, but only to add some perspective! 

* **All Feds staff are technically contractors Feds hires from University under UWaterloo's HR department** (this saves Feds a ton of money and is part of a very favourable contract between Feds and the Uni signed back when Feds first started). As such, Feds ""staff"" count as University employees, but are really contractors. 

* **Staff at the University (including those contracted to Feds) are _not_ part of a union or any similar legal collective.** They are part of a staff association and get votes on the University Senate (just as undergrads and grads do and just as Faculty do). In fact, the University is quite afraid of unionization by the staff which is why the University negotiates salary increases with the UW Staff Association. The Uni bends over on a lot to prevent Staff Unionization because it would be more costly. 

* A result of the above: Feds does _not_ negotiate with any staff unions; as no such unions exist. The University staff remunerative increases are scheduled by the University's Board of Governors under the agreement reached (typically) between the Uni's Senate and UW Staff Association. These increases in salary and benefits are offloaded to Feds, which means we often need to increase fees for CPI and what not beyond that. 

I hope this adds a bit more perspective. 

Personally, I feel that staff shouldn't be permitted to vote in the elections or referendum, but should be able to participate in General Meetings since matters that bind the Board of Directors and organization can directly affect their work, and perhaps their jobs. (the Board oversees the HR structure and the Board's personnel committee does control staff evaluation, discipline, and termination; and the Board must follow the orders of the AGM provided it doesn't violate the bylaws, letters patent, and the law).

EDIT: What /u/james05345 noted! Staff can vote in elections and at the General Meetings!"

"1.  STEM is popular with teenagers because it is one of the few complex topics they are capable of grasping, given that it includes very little human element.

2.  But think again - if TECH is something any teenager can do, is it really that hard?  Is it really that special?  Is it something to which one should aspire?  Is someone selling a meme here, if so, why?  What do they want from my tech skills?  Of course, the answer is clear, to anyone who understands human motivations, which sadly, is not a subject at UW.

Your boss wants you to succeed, so he will likely try to accommodate you and take some stress away. 

You shouldn’t be worrying about evaluations at this point — just work hard and try to learn as much as you can.  At worst, this company/job might just not be for you and you can start off with a clean slate for your next co-op. "

I'm still going to go into the cp/a program because I've wanted to be a programmer for a long time. I could go to uni here since I've lived here for a while (i actually went to uw but not in cs)....but honestly as much as I like programming the stress of uni is so much and I'm scared of failing so I'd rather take the college route. Hope I have a better experience than you

Anyway good luck in your career hope everything works out :-).

"As others said it sounds like you put in the work, but the effort was not applied correctly.  I have a family member currently at UW who has been hitting every prof office hour every week for feedback.  They had put a ton of effort into a paper also worth a substantial portion of their course mark for one of their courses.  They brought the draft into the prof a week before it was due and asked the prof for suggestions.  He promptly told this person they had done it all wrong and that the content completely missed the mark and it was not organized how his very much open to interpretation (but in his mind very specific) requirements specified.

So they completely redid their work sweating blood and tears due to the tight timeframe.  Result was a great mark following everything the prof advise on content, organizations, etc, but the class as a whole had an average in the very low 60's because everyone else made the made the same initial mistakes and never found out they were barking up the wrong tree.  The key here was prof office hours!  Its really the secret to success in so many courses.  It will save you a ton of grief by starting you off on the right track of where to apply your most valuable commodity: time."
"SE cohort is fantastic. Course structuring is rigid. SE dept. is actively making amends tho. My classmates are ridiculously smart- imo, on average smarter than the rest of engineering classes. The class culture is vehemently work &amp; result oriented, everyone pushes themselves harder. As a result it can get stressful. It's a different league of people, work, and challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

The real question worth asking is what do you want out of your university experience? Post UW, after a certain point money alone, wouldn't be the incentive driving you to do your tasks at work anymore. Similarly status, benefits, peers are only temporary incentives to your work. People come to UW to build a career. Find something that is rewarding for the sake of doing it. If you don't know what you want, don't tie down your precious time to something you know you don't like. That free time will help you go try new things. If you're looking to get into programming, CS is still a stressful, but a more flexible option than SE. Tbh, the bulk of my marketable hard &amp; soft skills have been acquired through co-op, which were acquired by doing side projects in my own time. Both workterms &amp; side projects are not exclusive to SE. You can be in any of the 6 faculties and develop those skills. I wish I would've had more time for myself. In the end, maximize your own personal utility. No one can tell you \*what's most useful to you\*, so figure that out and have fun while doing it."
"So I still suck at math, but I used to be in engineering and had to get through some math courses. I think one thing that really helped me (and still does to this day) is learning to understand things better. I always test how well I know a topic by - it sounds dumb - talking aloud to myself and ""teaching"" the material as though someone didn't know it and I'm the professor. This way, I can see where I'm not sure about things.

Edit: Even better if you can do this with friends - they can ask questions to see if you truly know what you're talking about!

For simplicity, we can take something like the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. I used to just memorize my way through how to do the questions. 

But then, at one point, I stopped to think: what the fuck is epsilon and what the fuck is delta?

So I started at square one and learned exactly what I'm doing when I do that. I learned the concepts. In laymen's terms almost, too.

Lastly, for my first co-op, I taught math and science at the high school level at my old high school. I noticed a lot of students in my grade 11 chemistry class were just memorizing and learning. For example, take the gas laws - like all the proportional/inversely proportional relationships with temperature, pressure, and volume. 

My students memorized the equations and didn't care to know why. Even if they did know that say, pressure increases with temperature, they failed to make the connection for the equations and other harder problems. So that's when I believed giving formula sheets was better, because I could test the students on applying the knowledge and understanding it, versus memorizing the equation.

That simplifies things a lot, I know, but I think the same thing applies here. "
"As an immigrant myself, I’m completely in favour of *LEGAL* immigration into Canada and particularly like the point system Canada uses to give points for applicants age, degree, health, English/French proficiency, etc to bring people who are the most likely to succeed here. Funny enough the system Trump proposed for the US reform was very similar to this but the media blasted it for being racist.

I like and support the principle of bringing refugees but like a lot of people am not in favour of blindly setting large quotas and bringing a large number of people in. From a practical standpoint they have a lower chance of success in Canada than someone who applied and put in the work here by choice and often struggle to adapt because of the nature of the way they came here. From principal I understand the point of developed nations having a duty to help others but to what extent? Any practical argument made is incorrect in my opinion as all of those benefits can be gained with less risks by just increasing legal immigration over bringing refugees. So from a humanitarian view we should accept them so far as they don’t negatively affect the lives of anyone who is already here. 

And lastly on the point of illegal immigration, this one particularly bothers me. On one hand I understand that everyone has the right and wants to pursue the best life for them and their kids, but to what extent should we actively endorse that for people who illegally enter? By sticking to that principle a citizen who steals from the rich to feed his family is also doing what’s best for him, so why must we punish him either. Making these issues emotional in general is a very slippery slope, and should be balanced with the reality of the difficulties of running a nation with millions of people already here who struggle daily.

Sorry kind of went on, but yea this is a topic I’m particularly interested in and find it frustrating that its discussion is often extremely sensational or harsh. "
"Are you me in second year? lol

Not a professional obviously, but the clinical criteria for depression is just 6 weeks of low mood. So even though your symptoms are transient and not constant, it doesn't rule out depression as a diagnosis. You exhibit anxious tendencies as well which isn't out of the norm as anxiety often co-occurs with depression. And just because you don't have the most extreme manifestation of a condition doesn't mean you don't have it. Depression has gradations, some people are high-functioning and some aren't. While your issue may have been precipitated by poor coping mechanisms initially, it's perfectly consistent that it could result in a cascade culminating in depression. Neurotransmitters are assholes sometimes

I think you should bring your concerns to a doctor. I really feel you on the ADHD/depression suspicion. I've had transient episodes like yours every year since a traumatic event in my life 4 years ago and used to be on Concerta, an ADHD drug, and it did wonders for me. Some might think that'd be a bad idea because it can worsen underlying anxiety, but I found it made me motivated enough to plow through and not ruminate all day. It really was a godsent. Just took it for a short period of time to recalibrate myself and get into a habit. 

The tricky thing is that convincing a doctor to prescribe an ADHD drug for something mimicking depression will make you look like a drug seeker. Docs are esp suspicious of students since many abuse stimulants as study aids. (Asked a new doctor to renew my 2 year old script and she refused because my symptoms fit in more with depression than ADHD to her)

What would most probably happen if you approached a doctor is that they'd want to prescribe some type of antidepressant. Most common ones are SSRIs, but serotonin doesn't really have much to do with motivation. Instead, suggest an SNRI (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) like Wellbutrin. I'm currently on it and it's not really doing much yet. The shitty thing about antidepressants is that they may or may not work for you and if they do they'll take weeks to take effect. 

Anyways, seeing a therapist/counsellor/shrink who could administer CBT would also be useful to give you new coping mechanisms and ways to handle stress. That combined with a course of medication could help you get back on track.

I've had years where I got 90s in every course unmedicated be followed by years where I got so bad I needed to withdraw for a term. It really helps having an established relationship with a doctor who knows your history and can help navigate recurrent episodes before they get that bad. It's good that you recognize something's not quite right, address it with a physician before it gets the chance to snowball!!"

"Well it might be called something different now. When I was in undergrad, we were called the off campus Dons. 2nd floor of the student Life center is our office. I think they changed their name to if campus community after I left. They are a resource and group of upper year students who work to connect first year students to campus while not living *on* campus (in residence). A lot of what they do is social events for those students, but they also provide supports, guidance for navigating things on campus like what to do if you need to change courses, majors, or need some help with figuring out rent rules, land lord problems, etc.... Or, I imagine, helping students not sleep on the street. Please go visit them."

"Every single man in this world’s primary evolutionary purpose in life is to have sex with women who are attracted to them.

Every single man, though they will never publicly admit this, wants to live a playboy lifestyle if they could.

"Watch the Erik Demaine MIT lectures on algorithms, that should cover fairly comprehensively anything that might appear. In particular, the ones on dynamic programming are important.

"Everyone invariably manipulates anyone they interact with, since no one wants to be truly alone in this world. True individualism is unattainable because we are inherently social creatures, yet true socialism is also impossible because we are inherently tribal creatures.

"As someone who just reviewed 100 undergrads resumes for a co-op position I can whole heartedly agree. 

Why include a relevent course section if your course are literally not relevent to the posting? You should really be changing your resume every job application.

All I want to see is grades, past experience, and maybe hobbies and extracurriculars in that order.

A summary section is usually worth it if you have lower marks but have killer working experience. 

Also I am going to look through all the resumes anyway, you really don't need to add icons that cover the page and change the standard 1 column format. It won't help me remember your resume any more if it was a bad application to begin with; it will only annoy me more when I have to double check which sections I'm reading.

Edit 1: To address these comments I didn't mean you should have the grades on the resume. Please don't do that other then if you're on a scholarship list or etc. because like someone mentioned the transcript given before the resume is sufficient. I also ment that I literally want to see grades in that order of viewing (which Waterloo does format it as) not that that order wise my proritization list with out any other considerations.

"You can have safe sex and still affect someone’s life. If we can agree that sex produces a chemical reaction in the brain, which it does, then a person does not have control over what kind of attachments form in that sense. I’m not saying that girls don’t have a responsibility to not assume, but guys ALSO have a responsibility to not assume either. Again, safe sex means communication too. If you’re gonna complain that girls complain too much, then you need to acknowledge your part in an act that involves two people.

General rules work really well when in general. This is a specific case where it doesn’t, because sex isn’t like other general interactions we have with people. I think we are disagreeing on whether or not sex is just like buying a drink or if it is more than that. We have both settled on our positions, and now we are just going back and forth. I can pull up as many studies as I could about how much different having sex is than a normal interaction. But the idea is that there is too much assuming and not enough communication, which is inarguably a part of SAFE SEX. You can not have safe sex without communication of expectations. That’s taking care of your emotional and physical health.

"I'm going to clarify something. There's no such deal with Laurier that ""we cannot establish a business faculty"". This is a rumour and is not true at all. Think about it. Is that even legal? And over the years, do you think that UW wouldn't renegotiate such a clause? For those claiming that this deal exists, show us the proof. There's no such deal, and you all ""heard from someone"", which is false information. If this deal really exists, then don't you think that would have applied to Math/bus, Sci/bus, env/bus, arbus, mgmt engineering, or any programs that related to business, including the new Conrad School of Entrepreneurship &amp; Business? If that's also the case, why is UW even allowed to have business courses in AFM, Math, Arbus, Econ or even marketing? At the same time, why is Laurier allowed to have math/science courses? UW and WLU are ultimately separate universities, we are allowed to take courses at each other's (or double degrees), but we are separate overall. Such binding contracts do NOT exist and in a way is restricting a school's academic freedom and research ability. If they truly want to restrict competition with Laurier BBA, they'd disallow institutions like SAF, econ, Math/finance to even exist nor will you be allowed to take the courses. However, UW still markets itself as ""study Accounting/Finance/business @ UW"". If you ever go to Unifair, on the sides of our booth (4 corners each), we actually have ""business+"" representatives in case people want to study ""business"" at UW. If we ever have that kind of restrictions. This would likely be disallowed.   


 I worked closely with recruitment at SAF and UW overall. I've asked the very same question to the admissions. They told me that this is something that people have been pushing the school to do and they now and then bring it up at the school's meetings. UW has been advertising itself ""having business-oriented programs"" with a touch of ""innovation &amp; entrepreneurship"". When I told them that ""apparently we have a contract with Laurier that we cannot have a business faculty"", the recruiter laughed and said, ""that's ridiculous, where you hear that""? I also asked admissions that, if students ask us: ""why doesn't UW have a business school? does UW have a business school? what if I want to study general business""? We are instructed to answer something along the lines of ""we do have many business programs that combine other disciplines such as Arbus, which allows you to customize your degree and explore various options under the broad umbrella of business. If you want to do accounting, we have Biotech/CPA, AFM, Math/CPA. If you want to do finance, we have CFM, double degree...if you're interested in other areas of business, such as marketing, we have those courses available as well. UW offers it all, but the way we organize it is that we simply don't have a business school established, although you are free to study them here at UW"".  


I hope this clears up the confusion and misconception about the ""we have a thing with Laurier that they are not allowed to have an eng faculty, while we are not allowed business faculty"" nonsense. You might ask then, why is it that UW never had a business faculty? What's the real reason? This is my personal opinion: obviously, UW might think, ""there's already Laurier on the other side of the street"", a lot of business programs are very well-established in Ontario. How does UW's new faculty able to compete with Queens, Ivvy, Laurier, UT? My second guess is that UW doesn't think it's worth the investment. Sure, we have our SAF, and many other business-related programs. But to establish an actual faculty, we need a lot of money. Say Bloomberg lab, full-time profs in marketing, accounting, finance, investments, operations management, you probably need a new building, how about the recruitment costs? How do we ensure UW has students? Are we able to ensure that if we establish a marketing program, it will be successful? There are too many considerations here. Having a business faculty means a complete reorganization of the university, and its programs (likely all Arbus/enbus/scibus/biotechCPA/mathCPA...would be merged?) and does that mean we should establish an MBA program? You might have noticed that the way UW markets its business programs are not the traditional BBA kind of thing. There's a lot more focus on entrepreneurship and innovation, say the new Conrad School. SAF markets itself as Accounting + Finance with CPA/CFA focus. These are areas where UW would have an edge compared to other big business schools and WHY students want to go to UW rather than Ivvy for business. This is probably also why AHS/Environment faculties are organized since they are really one of a kind in Canada, along with our Pharmacy/Optometry schools. I wouldn't be surprised if ever UW establishes a Business Faculty, it'd be named something like, ""University of Waterloo Faculty of Business &amp; Entreprenurship/Innovation/Data Analytics"".  


In my personal opinion, UW seems to be moving towards eventually establishing such a business faculty. We don't know in what form and what types of programs it will offer. I think UW already has lots of resources/profs/courses that would allow you to explore various aspects of BBA. We have a solid econ faculty with wide ranges of econ courses, we have many finance courses offered by Math &amp; SAF, we have HRM/Marketing courses, as well as lots of entrepreneurship opportunities and a well-established start-up culture. We have many business clubs established in UW already. If UW ever want to establish a business faculty, we really have a something for it. The problem remains with money. Who is going to donate to UW to establish it? How are we going to house a faculty with likely 5000+ new people? If you ever go to SAF during class begin/end, it's like a high school in there. The HH building is already like at full-capacity. You'd literally have to push people to get through, we need a new building if we ever have more new business students. You know how UW is, when would we ever get a new building that isn't engineering? I think the business faculty would be established eventually for better organization and branding (people and students are all confused of UW with the XX/business thing), but I don't think it's any time soon.

"From the last time that I took it (Winter 2018), midterms and exams allocated the same proportion of marks to the lectures and the readings: 80% lecture content, 20% textbook content.

"I haven't used CS advising as much as I should have. I think I only got a bad experience once with Brad Lushman, it's odd because he seem to be an otherwise patient and most considerate person. Maybe I got him on a bad day but since then I'm too chicken to go there again.

3. You seemed reasonable, so I replied to your comment instead cause I didn't think it was a complete answer.

"&gt; I don’t quite get the mountain analogy but it sounds like you’re saying women are objectively worse than men and that doesn’t make me feel very good.

Lol you definitely didn't get it. It's basically just saying women don't like to admit or face their shortcomings.

&gt; I think a lot of girls naturally feel shameful about it. That’s why there’s the whole “last minute resistance” thing they teach in pick up arts. Women don’t want to just say yes and feel like sluts generally.

I agree, they have a hard time saying no, which is why I think people need to be a lot more watchful of young girls.

&gt; Although, what exactly can you say to a woman who doesn’t want to have kids? You can shame her for it, and she may even be ashamed of it too, but that won’t change her mind. Wouldn’t it be bad for her to have kids against her will?

Idk. I just know we have a huge problem with women not wanting to have kids, to the point where we are dying off. "

"I'm late to the party, but your physical symptoms stuck out a bit. Something potentially easy to do is to start tracking the food you eat. Dump what you can into My Fitness Pal to get a general idea of what you're eating and what kind of things your body actually needs. Soreness, heart racing, and inability to concentrate may be due to improper sleep, but it sounds like you may be potentially short on electrolytes (magnesium and potassium specifically) and the unhealthy eating habits are a likely contributer. If you like to snack, try eating spinach with a vinagrette. Not my best suggestion, but it probably won't hurt. Try seeing a nutritionist on top of a counsellor. Insist they develop a gradual meal plan that you will actually stick with instead of a complete change if necessary.

Before going straight to the gym, try going for walks before it gets too cold and enjoy the fresh air. Tire yourself out by spending some time outside away from your bed and go to sleep at a reasonable hour. Hang out with people that make you laugh, or smile at the people you pass on your walks. If you have a habit of sleeping late, try incrementally shifting your sleep schedule earlier. Little physical changes can sometimes contribute to mental health. Also, in case it isn't, clean your room.

Just a heads up that going to counseling services if it's a non-immediately life threatening issue can take some time, so don't push back making positive changes until your meeting. 

Best of luck"
"&gt; Yes my dear, there is progression, but it's almost always private.

And that's a shame. Thankfully there is a culture shift happening where mental health is being destigmatized and can be more freely talked about, which improves outcomes for all. 

Also, painting everyone with a broad brush, alleging someone is experiencing/dealing with mental health ""wrong"" is problematic and assumes too much. If anything, you should applaud attempts to reach out and get help.

I don't understand why you find it unbelievable that someone would seek help if their mental health is declining or if they're in distress. That is alarming and troubling and no one wants to be in that position. There have been many a story of people making a final plea for help, calling 911 before they think they go to that point of no return. Why? Because of of instinctive self-preservation. Fear. Some people may live with suicidal thoughts and ideation for an extended period of time, and fear that they may act on them in the future or imminently.  Perhaps there are some who are just so broken that they want nothing more than to die and make one, or many attempts to kill themselves because they want it more than anything. But that type of thinking does not come out of nowhere instantly, it emerges and builds until it reaches fever pitch. And if you nip it in the bud early, you can keep it from returning. 

Help can be sought, with immediate hospitalization and ongoing medication. 

You sound jaded and your attitude towards your own mental health and that of others is defeating and could only result in a positive feedback loop of negative thinking. There is no one-size-fits-all model or experience of mental illness. Don't mock others struggles because they don't mirror yours or you've maybe had it worse. 

I suppose it's easier to get to the point where suicide sounds good if it was a very gradual descent into mental illness. It's much more jarring and harder to ignore when you have big ups and downs. But in the beginning you can still have insight that something is wrong and get help to address it. People respond and cope differently. The approach of reaching out is much more effective that withdrawing into yourself and entertaining your worst thoughts.

In that case, congratulations, you win, fightback club bad, but I don't trust you to have honest discussion about when people shouldn't have a platform for free speech.

"&gt;An armed populace is the only kind capable of protecting against tyranny

I agree, but anarchy would require a mutual understanding (a gentlemen's agreement) that everyone will stay in their own corner and anyone with expansionist tendencies who attempts to consolidate power would have to be spontaneously kicked to the curb by anarchists who then immediately go back to their own personal business.

Another huge issue with anarchism is currency, because bankers have made it so the populace only trusts their currency and governments are either in bed with or are subjugated by banks. It would take an immense feat of generalized trust to be able to remove banks from the picture, and banks have every reason to pit the populace against each other if an attempt is made to finally throw off that crony capitalist yoke. History shows that bankers are very good at spreading doubt in the minds of the people and undermining generalized trust to ensure that removing them (bankers) from the equation results in catastrophe including the deaths of millions. 

Money lenders are in one hell of a dirty business: They are nothing but middle men who pull the strings of governments, corporations, and individuals to endlessly nudge things back in their direction whenever anyone dares to stray from their iron grip on the globe. Socialism, communism, corporatism, and crony capitalism are nothing but different variations of banks running the world in order to give the appearance of choice and thus keep the mob from asking the real questions.  

Expect governments around the world to follow Sweden and remove cash from the picture to ensure that every transaction can be tracked and taxed, and expect them to then begin brutally cracking down on any transactions which are not done through their system....because who better to decide who gets the goodies (regardless of who made it happen) than our gloriously virtuous oh-so-nuanced-philosophy-that-we-can't-explain-it-to-the-peasants establishment?

"You need to approach this more maturely and accept what you did was wrong and disrespectful.. you say ""if I did X then she would do X""... But that's not what happened. The situation is that you kissed a different girl in front of her after she showed you warm feelings. Even though she did something *likely in retaliation*, you made the first move. 

You made a thread to ask for advice and now you're trying to defend yourself after people have pointed out your wrongdoings. My advice for how to move on in this situation? Accept that you made a mistake and hurt somebody, and take this situation as a learning scenario. If you really liked this girl as much as you said, then no, you wouldn't just go for any random chick."
"You're missing my point. My thesis is not that this set of behavior is more prevalent among Chinese internationals because they are Chinese.

My point is that it is prevalent among them because they are a large group of young foreign people.

If you normalize by group size, I'm sure you would find the same values + some factor in O(log N).

Why O(log N) and not O(1): because the larger the exogenous group is, the less accountability individual members of that group feel. Probably for a combination of reasons such as less effective ""social policing"" (i.e outrage at some frowned upon behavior in the hope that it will correct it) from the local in-group.

This implies that the locals (of any race) will feel like they need a much stronger reaction to ""punish"" the frowned upon behavior. Practically, this translate with a build-up of resentment followed by a lashing out.

But yeah, there's nothing intrinsically Chinese to this. To me it's behavior that you would see in any group of foreigners with a significant group size. Even if we say that the error factor is O(1) then people will still empirically encounter more incivility from the larger group of foreigners.

For example: at Berkeley, the summer school is popular among Irish teenagers. In the summer, you have a large group of young (late teen) Irish people coming in. You should see the complaints of the locals (mostly Asian-Americans) they map almost 1-1 to the complaints people here among toward Chinese internationals."
"I'm a stage 2 silver medalist who came in at the bottom rank from stage 1. Your final score is there sum of your stage 1 and stage 2 scores, and you are ranked on that. Speaking from experience, you don't need to do any preparation per se.

At the time, I took TIK2O1, ICS3U1, and was taking ICS4U1 (I went to a non-semestered high school), and did some self learning in my spare time mainly about how to use pygame and participated in DWITE and ECOO for fun in the last 2 and something years. I couldn't even do a BFS, and my sense for recursion has always been nothing stellar. 

Meanwhile, my competition knew about the fancy algorithms and whatnot coming in. In the end, some of them threatened to beat me up at the dinner table in front of their parents because they did worse than me.

At the end of the day, an algorithm is just a tool. How well you can use a tool to get a job done is in practice more important than using the optimal tool for the job (or even knowing about its existence). For example, let's take hammering a nail. Person A has a hammer, but he uses the claw side to try to pound the nail in, this understandably yields poor results. Person B has no clue what a hammer is, but has a baseball bat so he uses the flat top of the bat to pound the nail in. Suboptimal, unconventional, but it achieves the goal of getting the nail in.

Moral of the example above? If you can't use a tool properly, knowing about its existence will be a distraction to you in the actual contest and may cause you to do worse than you would otherwise. 

Do yourself a favour, don't memorize algorithms. Understand them. I think others have already commented on the standard set of algorithms and data structures enough, so I won't comment on that."

"Before I really wake up in the morning, I decide on five things I want to accomplish. These things could be simple, like buying groceries, or more work focused, like finishing up a small project.

I try to say the five things out loud before getting up since it helps me to remember, and also makes me feel more accountable to accomplish these things.

When I wasn’t feeling motivated with school, I’d usually make a goal of going to a professor’s office hours to run any questions by them, or talk through some ideas. This helped me feel more assured moving forward, and also more enthusiastic about my projects since I’d usually get a better sense of clarity.

Also, I recommend jumping to the end of the year in a planner/calendar. Write down a few modest goals of where you want to be in a few months’ time. Then work backwards, so in order to achieve xyz by the end of the year, today, doing abc would be a step in the right direction.

Hope this helps/makes sense!

"Yes, that is a question we've been asking and looking into as well. Unfortunately, there's not a clear cut answer at this point as Work Term reports are controlled by the faculties (and some faculties down to the Department Level), not the Co-op Department, and therefore the Fee is assessed as Tuition on Quest, separate from the Co-op Fee. 

What exactly does it pay for? Well, in theory it should be paying for the resources it would take to mark the workterm reports (TAs, admin etc.) but it's not clear if the the $14/student is an appropriate number or not (it has been $14 for many years and no one really seems to know why). 

But thank you for your question, more and more students seem to be asking about it so it is something we will stay on top of. Despite it being outside the purview of the Co-op Department and the Fee Review Deep Dive, CEE staff have indicated to us they're attempting to get more information on it from different departments (Finance and Faculties)"

"You’re underestimating what the government should be doing. 

Can’t compare our govt to, let’s say, Syria’s.

Sure maybe it’s good here. But crime is rising (especially in Toronto, shootings have skyrocketed this year), house prices have been soaring over the last few years, jobs have been declining (due to the min. wage increase). Mortgages are getting harder and harder to get. While all this is occurring, the “govt” is providing financial support for immigrant families to help them settle in Canada.

The avg person leads a shitty 9-5 life with no financial freedom. They’re slaving away for basic necessities like food, rent/mortgage, etc. 

Working for the government is a job. And any job has requirements, tasks, and deadlines. If engineers, doctors, etc do subpar jobs we voice opinions and expect more. It’s the same for government workers, right?

"I don't think this this is good, but its not like this is a slippery slope. The university isn't going to start claiming the technology from all the velocity startups. There is an actual legal issue concerning the ownership of the IP that this startup is using. I'm not a lawyer and I have no idea who is in the right, but its not like the university is ignoring its IP policy. It clearly states that there is an exception when outside organizations fund the research. Whether or not the research was funded by JCESR seems to be the disagreement.

The university isn't one homogeneous organization, I am sure that the department suing is not the same as the department in charge of velocity. Its unfortunate but the success of velocity companies isn't everyone's top priority, especially when $600k is on the line. If you've actually attended UW I'm sure you won't be surprised by how inconsistent or frustrating the bureaucracy and administration can be. 

The university brags about their IP policy because it actually encourages commercialization of research. If the university got a large cut of your company and a say in how your IP is used while not actually contributing anything to the company, it could really dissuade people from starting a company. UW is trying to make a trade off to encourage startups by giving up what could potentially be millions of dollars worth of equity of companies in exchange for having more successful companies that give back to the school in other ways."

"&gt; I'm Jewish, and still think nazis should be allowed to speak.

I'm Jewish, and I don't think giving neo-nazis a platform is in society's best interest. 

&gt; underground communities are what is dangerous

Not normalization of dangerous behavior like anti-vaccination, neo-nazis and other such things? If the KKK wants to donate to a lot of locations, the locations will refuse to accept them because that'd normalize them. 

&gt;  Their idiocy should speak for itself.

Until it's normalized, and people assume that since there's an opinion on both sides, the truth is somewhere between ""vaccines are safe and important for regular people"" and ""vaccines literally only cause autism and have no benefit"", when in reality it isn't true. 

&gt; It is worse to push these people outside of the sphere of reasonable debate.

I can see where you're coming from, but I don't think your argument is flawless. However, I'd like to challenge you to a question: beyond any ""slippery-slope"" fallacy (or any fallacy for that matter), what exactly is more dangerous about not letting neo-nazis (or anti-vaxxers, if you'd rather) enter the sphere of acceptable debate in society? How can you prove beyond reasonable doubt that it's more dangerous?

"By editing do you mean graphic design with Adobe Creative Suite, video editing, or...?  

Close friend is in GBDA - you do get courses that introduce you to Adobe CS, but a lot of her work requires at least intermediate skills in like Photoshop and Illustrator to do well. Lots of design-related tasks. Plus I know of other people in her program who are advance-level in design (think illustrated portraits, PS paintings, etc). Other than graphics, video editing skills would also be necessary, cos I know of this animation-based video project and another one where they had to make some sort of video tutorial for GBDA.

As for workload... can't really comment like a person who is in GBDA themselves, but judging from how my friend has a part-time job, is involved in clubs, and still gets pretty good grades, overall I think it is manageable?  Like there's a lot - you're constantly doing some design/video related task plus studying for more book-based classes like econ &amp; history to media or something, but I think the average person can pull through.  That said, you probably shouldn't be too bad at graphic design/video/animation/whatever bcs those projects can take a looong time (coming from someone who does graphic design).  "

"This is a great question. While you can't opt-out of the Feds fee (though you can opt-out of Society and administered fees collected by Feds), you can express this concern to your Councillors ([their list is here](https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/students-council)).

I will note that some things Feds provides aren't immediately tangible -- eg. advocacy and lobbying efforts. These are things like OSAP reforms that came into effect this year that were the product of like 3-5 years of lobbying work by OUSA and Feds. There's more examples like this (eg. LRT being free to ride with GRT UPASS membership coming soon, whenever LRT actually rolls out).

You can see how we spend money here broken down in our Budget report: https://uwaterloo.ca/feds/sites/ca.feds/files/uploads/files/feds_budget_report-oct2018.pdf 

If you think we should allow partial opt-out (of the non-advocacy based portions of the fee) then please do bring this case up with your councillors to represent it at Council!"
"Looking back first year wasn't actually that hard in terms of knowledge and content - for myself and some others, I know it was the rush of university that overwhelmed them. Living on your own (who knew learning to take care of yourself was so hard), lack of studying/discipline, lax attitude towards school, FOMO (school clubs, parties, cute girl in class -&gt; maybe gf? Oh shit she has a BF. Well fuck this is awkward.) I took a 6 class workload in my 5A and my mark range was 80-96. I failed Math136 in 1B (55 won't meet progression) and looking back, it wasn't how it was taught or the difficulty of the content that was the issue - it was a poor understanding of expectations and a bad attitude/discipline towards self-learning. I think if you're a hard-working student who really focuses on learning deeply (scanning through notes did nothing for me, learned better when I tested myself). You can definitely manage some semblance of a social/healthy lifestyle without having to cram for exams. 

The biggest piece of academic advice for university is to really think about what concepts they're going to test. Fundamentally, think about the key takeaways from each lecture or assignment. It might be as simple as this is how to diagonalize a matrix or sometbing more complex as how to use a certain proof style or high-level as what are the key facts/theories to take away. Sometimes they will try to cram a bunch of useless shit and you'll hate it but please trust me, it will get better. "
"**Internet censorship in China**

Internet censorship in China is among the most extensive in the world due to a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. More than sixty Internet restrictions have been created by the government of China, which have been implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, companies, and organizations. According to CNN, the apparatus of China's Internet control is considered more extensive and more advanced than in any other country in the world. The governmental authorities not only block website content but also monitor the Internet access of individuals; such measures have attracted the derisive nickname ""The Great Firewall of China.""

As per Hoffman, different methods are used to block certain websites or pages including DNS poisoning, blocking access to IPs, analyzing and filtering URLs, inspecting filter packets and resetting connections.Amnesty International notes that China has ""the largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world,"" and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders stated in 2010 and 2012 that ""China is the world's biggest prison for netizens."" The offences of which they are accused include communicating with groups abroad, signing online petitions, and calling for reform and an end to corruption.

"What the article is saying is that you shouldn’t tell the border agents that you’re a “programmer” because that’s one of the keywords they look for when rejecting candidates. If you are working at a Cali startup/Big N/Unicorn/ any known company, you’re not getting hired to be a code monkey and to write scripts a high schooler could’ve written. You are getting hired as a Software Engineer. This is such a broad term and it can apply to both new grads and experienced people, and it can apply to more low level/embedded roles too. 

If anything, I would classify bootcamp graduates as “programmers” as they have a much lower understanding compared to what a CE/EE/SE/CS grad would know about “programming”. "
"Like I said, I support increased transparency, especially to students who care about the Federation and its performance. If I make all these arguments at Board, there are good chances an amendment to make the budget transparent to students will still fail, because I have to convince everyone on the Board it's a good idea and doesn't present undue risk to the Federation, but people are not easy to convince. We are taking Bomber's losses seriously (finally), and we are trying to improve the performance, so please at least trust me that we are doing what we can. Nobody wants to see Bomber go away because it's got a long history with the University, but we are exploring **all** reasonable options available to us. I am unfortunately not allowed to go into much detail, or I would, but I understand and sympathize with your frustrations.

If you'd like to find out more and be more involved, I can only encourage you to get involved with the Board when elections happen this winter."
"This study doesn't help at all in determining if the difference in interest is due to biological or environmental factors. If the difference is due to environmental factors, then I don't see what should be controversial about intentionally correcting for those factors. This study from Strumia's slides provides at least some indication that biology plays a role ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222673203\_Sex\_Differences\_in\_Human\_Neonatal\_Social\_Perception](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222673203_Sex_Differences_in_Human_Neonatal_Social_Perception)), but doesn't do anything to rule out environmental factors.

Even if there is no difference in interest due to environmental factors, which seems incredibly unlikely, there's still no evidence provided by that study to determine whether the difference in interest accounts for the entire gender disparity.

So to answer your question, we don't just avoid discussing this because it disagrees with the political narrative, we also don't discuss it because it's completely useless for answering any of the relevant questions.

This study (mentioned in the article) is probably more useful: [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100614541236](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100614541236)

Seems to show little to no gender discrimination in some aspects of higher academia.

I think Strumia's comment is more on point than he intended: women are ""welcomed **after** showing what they can do."""

"probably.

Canada is one of the most welcoming countries in the world, and living as a minority still sucks ass. Being away from all the comforts of your childhood and culture, parents, family etc. can't be easy either."

"But seriously bro, start watching ANYTHING, when you got time. Like during weekends? Winter break for sure.

Read the news maybe? (If its too boring maybe watch a video, maybe some trending news videos) Im up to date with the news, you know, to make small talk...

TV shows, Movies pick any genre...(How do you not like watching them? I dont get it)

Else, I have no idea what you can talk about, unless you're interested in a topic (maybe sports?) and you can talk about it?"
"Having the same issue. I thought my original submission was wrong because my manager used a ""Reviewed by"" signoff instead of an actual ""signature"", but looks like other people are having issues too. 

Seems incredibly unprofessional on their end to tell a bunch of students that their submissions are wrong, with no explanation, come up with an arbitrary deadline, and then ghost all of them.

Edit: does anybody know if they have a physical office that students can drop by?"
"I did tech support in a high school.

$14 dollars an hour 7 hours a day, 6 of which I spend watching TV or playing video games. The little work I did do was basically a bit of scripting, fixing printers and running the AV.

I'd say this was close to a median job among all the 1A engineers, though the other SEs/ECEs tended to do better, I guess because a novice programmer is at least vaguely useful vs a novice ME, CHE etc.

I've gotten programming jobs every term since.  "
"In my opinion, the program is reasonable in difficulty, but is poorly structured. I think a lot of students set themselves up for failure. Many students are used to having a lot of time to learn things, which they don't have in ECE. For example, a lot of students got their admission average by going to outside review classes and spending days studying for simple tests. You don't have that kind of time, and a lot of people either can't learn that quickly or can't adjust. "
"Men arent boyfriend machines you put sex tokens in to recieve a relationship. Sorry not sorry.  If a guy wants to test the waters to see if he likes a girl enough to date while fucking her, he can take as much time as he wants. The same way a woman can lead a guy on to test the waters before they fuck. It's the same exact thing.   If you want to lower your risk of being ""used"" for sex, then stop giving it up so easily. Or dont, cant say I have a problem with easy pussy. "
"The meds aren't perfect in keeping you in a happy state, and in cases can exacerbate symptoms. Talk to your doctor if you can try a different antidepressant. 

In the meantime, if nothing is really that hard in your life like you say, then you can try some self regulation. When you are feeling it come on, try doing things that will make you happy (e.g. hanging out with friends, playing games, watching shows, whatever it may be), and tell yourself that everything is good."
"I really hate to say this considering your experience has been less than ideal. But Waterloo isnt my first uni and ive been hospitalized and had treatment like through the regular public system....  and our school system isnt as awful as it could.

"Most companies that hire through WaterlooWorks will adjust the salary based on how many co-ops the student has under their belt. I think it would be perfectly reasonably to politely ask for a slight increase in salary because 1) You are in a more senior co-op term and 2) You have worked at the company before so would be able to make a bigger impact. I'm not sure how to use the Silicon Valley offer as leverage, but maybe play that card if the first suggestion doesn't work?"

"As far as I understand (I'm on the fence about this issue), the general reasoning for keeping parts of the budget private is because there are sensitive operational details (such as people's salaries) that are inherently revealed by providing full budget figures. In the case of the commercial services, that could fall under the reasoning that that part of Feds runs as a business and businesses generally don't disclose detailed financials (although with publicly traded companies that could be a different matter). Of course, such reasoning all falls apart with the fact that the commercial services have losses (which is the bigger issue for me). I will be listening during the GM for what directors have to say on this subject."
"Does CAPS have any existence beyond a facebook page? What if I wanted to ask questions anonymously? (Just a suggestion that having only a Facebook presence is very restrictive in terms of accessibility)

Has Feds ever tried to bring up the lack of an Ombudsman to the university? Or is that not something that is under the role of FEDS?
(ninja edit: What's the official UW stance on the lack of a Ombudsman?)
last edit: For other students that have issues/will have future issues, is there a helpful FEDS page that outlines the services that FEDS provide specifically regarding complaints against CECA/co-op that you can link to? (Rather than just your email, because assuming different people hold that position in different terms)"
"I agree with you that complaints should first be addressed to the LTB and I maybe worded my post too strongly.

There has been a lot of talk about affordable housing in the area, and how to make it accessible. If all the buildable land is allotted to shitty student rental companies, how will the region achieve their goals?

It's all fine and dandy to be angry about the homecoming and the St Patrick's Day events (maybe this post is better suited for WLU then!) but if students are treated like outsiders to the city, we can't expect them to feel included you know? I work at the university on a contract and I am the only one voting in the research group, aside from the boss), yet I have lived here for a shorter amount of time."
"I am in debt. ~30k of OSAP debt. I was in co-op. Parents did not pay a penny for my education because we are broke.

However, over all my co-ops I have managed to save roughly 15k that I had stored as my emergency fund which fortunately I did not have to touch considering my financial situation (and this is after paying for tuition and rent. OSAP basically covered my living cost, which was barely enough). And because I didn't finish my full time job hunt until early October I didn't use my emergency fund to pay OSAP yet. Also fortunately my brother is willing to lend me 12k as well because it's better to owe my brother than OSAP. So once I get my pay cheques for work I'll be paying the rest off as aggressively as possible."
"I have though for the past month, and I try my best. We've gone out for lunch many times, and I have no trouble there. It's just during work hours or lunch here or there, I still feel awkward because I'm forcing myself to sound social. I have already asked about family, hobbies, school, experiences, the usual ""how was your weekend?"" but it still pretty tense and awkward between us  still. I don't know what's wrong with me, but our team itself is pretty quiet as it is and my coworker is like 25 so he'd rather hang out with his other friends on different teams and not us quiet folks.... (side note: he usually goes for coffee breaks with his other friend on the OTHER team instead of ppl on our team--- that's how awkward I am)"
"I know you’re out of town, but it’s probably best to go out of your way to get your references. They’re a really important part of your application and if you can’t take that seriously at least, maybe you should reconsider law (sorry if that’s harsh!)

There’s some good email templates online for med school recommendations if you were a “hermit” in their class. I suggest you try that! Also look into professional workplace references (not sure if they’re allowed!)

6 weeks is last minute. Especially for law because every Tom, Dick and Harry applies. Keep in mind other professional school deadlines are looking—profs are busy. If you want a quality letter rather than a subpar one, two-three months is key. "
"Oh yeah they are alive and well. I guess I can take solace in the fact that they *never* moved to Canada. They would have had to do manual labour and live a crappy life for the rest of their lives here. It would break my heart. But it's complicated - I don't call where my parents live home.

Haha exactly. I think it's ludicrous that even the *notion* of having more foreign students than domestic ones is conceivable in this country. It might have something to do with my upbringing, but I don't think that's a good model. Globalization is beneficial, but only when done to some extent. And the fact that there's pretty much nothing to do here doesn't help either. I feel like somebody ripped out a part of me when I moved here.

"
"1 - who cares if this generates a loss? most student services generate a loss for the benefit of the students (personal, educational, social, etc.). We don't go one by one and ask if we should shut down a service that benefits maybe 5% of the students, because it generates a loss and would save 95% of the people $2. 

2 - there is no analysis on WHY Bomber is losing money. What has changed? Has there been less traffic and how much is due to the SLC renovations (temporary in nature)? (one revenue driver) Has there been more discounting to maintain the same amount of traffic? (Another revenue driver) Has it been impacted by the minimum wage hikes? (an expense driver) Are we staffing people inefficiently? (too many people at non-peak hours) How is traffic distributed by time of day? could we get more people in during day hours when its significantly undercapacity? Would we have to improve service to do so? Should we raise price on alcohol? 

Frankly, we don't know any of this, nor who provided this ""consultation"".

Imagine the following

Patient: I'm dying
Doctor: great I have four options - amputation, chemo, advil or nothing. wyd????

does it make sense to dispense a prescription w/o understanding the cause of the sickness? ofc not

Why isn't the following an option: Keep the bomber idea (restaurant and nightclub in prime student area), and rent the right to operate it to a local promoter that is successful (via RFP process). They pay 500k annually + a % of revenue or something and bear the operational and financial risk, but have a guarenteed 10 yrs to operate the space + options to extend. A campus nightclub and restaurant is a wetdream for a promoter, and they wouldn't fuck it up like the school's management

"Fuck Wish.

I worked for Wish in my 3rd co-op term (between 2B and 3A). Up to that point, I had done two decent dev coops and had relatively good grades. My interviewer was really nice and the job description seemed great. I eventually chose to go there over Yahoo, because they offered slightly better compensation. The below all applies to Platform but I won't specify further for obvious reasons.


Here's a few reasons to not work for Wish:

- The code base is a fucking dumpster fire. The average CS 246 student could design a better layout for this bullshit than they are currently using. 

- ""Weekly"" CEO meetings my ass. Maybe once a month Peter came down to grace us with His presence, and when He did it was always an hour of telling us how we fucked everything up this time

- By the way, everything breaks. Every. Single. Day. The longest that we went without a critical infrastructure failure in my time there was probably ~3 days, if I'm being generous

- Code review is nonexistent. Absolute shit code gets pushed through without getting more than a cursory look and when prod breaks, all the blame returns to the intern who wrote it rather than the mentor who ""reviewed"" it

- The projects I got ranged from tedious to actually interesting. The bigger projects were plagued with scope creep, and whenever that made me unable to deliver on time (even when making this clear to management), you have one guess as to who took the blame. On one occasion, they just changed their mind on a major project of mine, and decided to scrap my 2 months of work. Thanks.

- ""We treat interns like fulltimes"" is slang for ""we don't really give a shit about mentoring you"". I wish I was lying when I say that the most substantial feedback I got--from a coworker, and not my mentor, mind you, was on how I should format a line that went over 80 characters

- And fuck intern events apparently because we sure did like 1 of those.

Is it all as doom and gloom as I make it out to be? No, probably not. I did genuinely enjoy about 3 weeks of my co-op term, somewhere in the middle of it. A handful of people I worked with were legitimately nice people who I would work with in the future. But that's a pretty piss-poor record for a company who boasts how much they love interns.

Maybe this is different for product. I had a friend who worked on product and enjoyed it. If you wanna get your foot in the door in Cali and this is your only option.... go for it, maybe. But if you have anything else, steer clear imo

fuck wish

"Well...part of the difficulty is in adjusting. I mean, of course it's easy if you've already done it. It took a while for my study habits to really change for the better from high school to university. I would focus more on actual problem solving in math for sure. I would prepare much further in advance for things, like I do now. I think back to how I would try to do Math 135 assignments in a single day, right before it was due. Or study for midterms 2 days in advance, at most. I didn't even do that badly in first year, but really I should've done worse by all rights, I did all the stupid things. Now I prepare far in advance for midterms, and start smaller assignments a week in advance, and larger assignments even further. "
"that v1 food services is such a scam.

you pay $1000 for a meal plan to which it automatically gets halved and so your $1000 turns into $500. in exchange, they claim that they give you 50% discount on all ur purchases, but essentially youre not getting any discount at all since your purchased plan got halved already. 

basically, youre forced to pay off for the food services that wasnt invoked for the full sum of $1000 initially, and when the term ends, your 50% discount is no longer effective.

it’s rather a “use up your full meal plan during your stay at v1 and breakeven on your initial investment” or “lose 50% of the residual meal plan money at the end of the term and thus losing out on your initial investment”"
"Oh interesting! I've heard quebec French described as the equivalent to a thick southern accent when compared to English. Is that true?

Then there is logic ""games"", which are about 25% of the test and include A LOT of if/then type stuff. Then there is reading comprehension (my weakest section lmao) which gives you an article to read and you answer questions about it. It's all multiple choice and like 90% about time management. Each of the 5 sections are 35 minutes and then there is an additional 35 minutes to write a short essay on a topic. It's a pretty nifty test! I wrote it in SJ2, which was pretty lucky!

- Consider adding a location (city) with your general information. Gives recruiters context for where you're based out of
- Your professional summary should only be 3-4 bullet points long
- ""And an eye for good design"" - this is a very subjective statement and not backed up by anything. I would write something else here
- ""Takes a leadership role"".. sounds weird. do you take these roles when you're not supposed to? Instead write that you have strong leadership and teamwork skills working in a collaborative environment
- Saying you're an expert level in anything while you're in your second year is not recommended. People who have been in the industry for 10-15 years are experts. You can say you're proficient
- Take the bronze medal out of your professional summary. Doesn't belong there. Your summary is not a list of your achievements but top skills/tools/languages you possess
- For your work experience list the months that you worked there. Giving just one year means nothing. Recruiters won't know how long you worked there (i.e. January 2018 - May 2018)
- Provide locations for your work experience to provide context for which HQ/location you worked at (i.e. more impressive if you worked at their main office in NYC)
- Make your employment sections look more even by sticking to 3-4 bullet points for each. Your Core Software Developer is too long and your Systems Analyst too short
- What does furthering the WRC Risk &amp; Compliance even mean? I have no idea which skill this takes and I'm not sure recruiters will know either? Either re-write this to be explicit about a relevant skill or take it out 
- How did you customize data copy? Which programs/tools/programming languages did you use here? What was the end result? Did your work have a positive effect?
- How did you set up the company website as a systems analyst? Which parts did you do? Coding, backend, frontend, visual design? Which language is this in?
- What did you do to improve the performance time on table of contents...?
- ""Performed routine JUnit.."" Remove the word ""routine"" here. Makes this task seem boring and not worth mentioning.
- How did you set up the company website as a systems analyst? Which parts did you do? Coding, backend, frontend, visual design? Which language is this in?
- Add more bullet points under your Systems Analyst position!
- Your point about Stock Sentiment Predictor uses the word ""efficient"" twice in the same sentence
- Your points on your open source projects seem bland. You really only list what they are and don't demonstrate which skills you developed here or why any of these project are impressive. Dig deeper on these
- Ocean Awareness Writing Contest: What did you have to write about? Why/how is this relevant to CS jobs you're applying to?
- National Scholarship: Do not list how much money you won. That means nothing to the recruiter and doesn't necessarily indicate your skill. You said it's awarded to exceptional students. What does that mean? What exactly did you achieve to be awarded this?
- Explain what the CCO is and what you did/which project you created to win the bronze medal
- Your additional skills and experience section is a bit too long which is what is eating up your page space. Choose only the relevant ones. Try to cut out as much high school experience as possible. You're in university now and the real world doesn't really care about what you did in high school
- Your spoken languages, operating systems, and software belong more in your summary or in a smaller section focused just on your skills. You'll have room for this if you switch to a two-column template
- Don't list your French knowledge in years. Years doesn't necessarily translate to skill. Give a qualifier such as intermediate, fluent, proficient, etc. 
- How did your manga place at Jump's Universal Manage Contest. Give context for your achievement. Also not sure that this is worth mentioning if you're looking for CS jobs
- Computer Club President: Cut the part about becoming president in your 4th year. Doesn't add anything to this point. Which type of programming did you teach? You should have each experience in this section as its own point (like in your work experience) and then have the tasks as bullet points. Cramming everything into sentences looks messy
- Newspaper Team Editor: Same thing as above. Don't include when you became it (you have a year after-all for context). What short of articles did you help edit? Which skills did you develop here? Be more explicit
- Math Club Executive: Remove sentence about when you took on this position. Explain which type of lessons, problems you created and which contests members were trained for. Way too vague as written currently
- I would remove School Prefect, Student Mentor, and Math School Champion. They look like filler
- Your Education section is too long. You do not need a subpoint for your relevant courses. Just list them and I wouldn't put grades next to them. Just a list is fine"

No they don't help, cause the only marks admission officers use are the predicted Ontario conversions. HL math and physics are good for making first year easier, but getting 100s from SL courses is far more advantageous because it gets you into eng. My old Xavier friends said that HL math conversions are pretty rough at your school, so you're gonna have to work extra hard to get those good grades. Sorry bud. "

Half is number crunching. These are ""free"" marks up for grabs, and you get good by crunching through practice problems.

The other half is proofs, which is a lot harder than the former.

Sometimes they don't, in which case you lie down and cry, a lot. "

Balkanization. Faith Goldy has never once advocated for deportations. She's pushing to slow down immigration and return to pre-1970 immigration policy. Was Canada a neo-Nazi country in 1960?

Keep buying into, and spreading lies. Not like it matters to you, when you have a free pass to your very own ethnostate whenever you feel like it.

"Hmm think self-respect comes with reducing pride and having a goal to live your best self. Feeling shame or disconnected with what you do should not be dismissed; acknowledge how you feel and accept it. I think self-respect is lowered only when you don't accept the uglier side of what we do/did. I dunno, and be proud of successes and failures; the moment you truly accept both sides will be when you come to understand yourself better. When you understand yourself better, you slowly gain respect for yourself. Not sure if this makes sense?

"I've never felt so fucking cheated in my academic career. A question not relevant in the slightest to the course to be worth 10%. After spending so much time doing almost every practice problem in the textbook every weekend, attending every class and tutorial and then having this dumb question lose 10% of my course mark. To add insult to the injury, this was a random quiz and we didn't know about the date it was going to be administered! 

So the correct answer according to the prof is 400nm -800nm because he wrote approximate in the question when 400nm- 800nm is actually more precise than 340nm- 770nm. This explanation is especially wrong because he didn't even change the accuracy of the number (e.g. 400.0009 nm vs 400 nm)."

"Uh, just grind problems until you know exactly what you need to do when you see a problem.

90s in first year kind of doesn't really matter. A lot of the material is stuff that gets covered in high school or people have seen in tutorial programs. So the mark disparity is largely coming from whether people are learning it for the first time or second time.

To be honest it's probably better to just work on other things than to spend all your time to push past the 90 boundary."
"I doubt it. The Engineering and Math admissions committees operate completely separately from one another. Engineering also uses a high school adjustment factor, while Math doesn't. The fact you got an early offer into Engineering would not affect your admissions into Math at all. 

However, there is some randomness in the AIF, which contributes up to 15% for Math and 5% for Engineering (I may be wrong) and you may have overestimated the quality of your AIF. CS is also just a competitive program to begin with and international applicants have lower odds than domestic students, mostly just because they have less seats to compete for.

"I'm surprised at these comments. I personally know people with  names that are difficult to pronounce that are super successful. If you're good at what you do, it doesn't matter if your first name is 2 letters or 20. They hire you based on how good your resume looks and what you've done in life. And if they don't hire you because of that then you're better off somewhere else anyways tbh. Don't change who you are just because the times are different. Make them accept you bro. "

"Uh, I don't have personal experience but usually in these situations things don't go real bad unless you're rude. 

It's well known that CECA treats us as second-class to employers, but I really can't see them being like ""how dare you even ASK for an alternative arrangement! You are banned from WW for 3 terms!"" unless you get belligerent. They put our interests second, but they don't go out of their way to be spiteful. 

The one time I asked to reschedule (interviews all took place in 2 hrs - during my 3 hr lab), they relayed it to the interviewer and he just rescheduled for later in the day. That was a phone interview, mind you, but from my point of view there's potential upside and not much potential downside to you asking. "
"Well I am a victim of second hand smoke from both weed and cigarette smokers who feel the need to smoke in public, maybe it's not radiation but it sure can give you cancer. I really don't care if people smoke weed in private and I don't care about edibles at all but I am very annoyed with what is going to be legal in a few days, in theory there are restrictions in a lot of public areas but in reality the restrictions are not properly enforced on cigarette smokers and I doubt they will do any better with weed smokers. It should not be legal to smoke anything just on the sidewalk where people are walking by and the 9m from building doors should be extremely strictly enforced with large fines and (short or maybe weekends only or whatever) jail time for repeat offenders. It is not weed that bothers me at all, it is people removing my choice not to use weed which will probably happen on a regular basis with the law changing considering it already happens about once a week right now."

Wow you're diagnosing me a lot aren't you. 

So I'm...neurotic, obsessed, projecting, and I have issues. I think you said earlier I was insane. Gaslighting.

You seem to care a lot that I stop caring. All your advice is to discourage me from caring. 

This affects me yes. And everyone else here, directly or indirectly. Having safe spaces benefits us all. Safe for our female psychologists. Safe for young women who visit Counselling Services. As interns or students. All are being harmed by this man and those promoting him and his actions directly or indirectly.

Maybe not many others cared before me. Now I care, along with new others. I expect more will care, after us. The care, voices, actions are just growing. Not just in the US, but right here at UW too.

The Kavanaugh attack on Dr Ford was 36 years ago. David Mackay's attacks on Dr Morgan and Dr Winter were only 9 years ago. And we don't know if he and UW's management have even stopped the reprisals against Dr Morgan that she claimed, and I completely believe were perpetrated against her. 

Because of Dr Morgan's brave intervention to stop David Mackay's sexual attack against Dr Winter, and Dr Morgan's reporting, we know of these several incidents:

- David Mackay's sexual attack on Dr Winter

- David Mackay's sexual attack on Dr Morgan

-David Mackay's several physical intimidations of Dr Morgan at the Counselling Services

- Dr Tom Ruttan's letter on behalf of UW, banning Dr Morgan from reporting any further intimidations of her by David Mackay, unless David Mackay touched her

The current situation continues under UW's President Dr Feridun Hamdullahpur. He could have put a stop to this mistreatment at any time but each day chooses not to."

"In the physics department, we had outstanding student advisors like Rohan Jayasundera, and Tan Dinh (not officially an advisor, but he was great to go to for advice anyways). Wouldn't go outside of the physics department for advising though, people seemed to not be of great help when addressing program-specific needs. When I was in co-op (before I switched out to regular stream), the advisors that I encountered really weren't much help. They offered only general co-op advice, and nothing about applying to jobs and finding employment within physics or related fields. Granted, I have gripes with the co-op program in general (that's probably outside the scope of this post), so that may be affecting my impression of their advisors."

Thus, lie intelligently when you can (ie. They cannot prove by rgeircien rules that you are lying) and failing that, just deny.  Deny everything.

"You need to advocate for yourself when it comes to medication and your needs. Family doctors (the doctors at Health Services) can and do provide psychiatric medications. In fact, I was started on antidepressants and some medication for panic attacks by a doctor there BEFORE meeting the psychiatrist I was referred to. I saw a psychiatrist for about a year and now I actually just see a family doctor there to manage the meds as at the moment; I don't need a psychiatrist anymore. Make another appointment and tell them you want to start something now. 

However, I will say: it is possible that it might be better to wait until after exams to start antidepressants anyways. They take 4-6 weeks to begin having a real effect, but there can sometimes be some bad side effects while getting used to the medication. I don't know your situation though, so obviously talk to the doctor about this. I just want you to be aware of the side effects, because it could affect your exam performance. 

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my teenage and adult years. Last year, I experienced some trauma, and I also suffer from panic disorder and PTSD. I know things seem really crappy right now, but things can and will get better. If you need to talk or rant, you can always send me a PM. 

Lastly, there are a few things you can do without medication to help: I personally find meditation and drawing to help me relax when I'm feeling anxious and I know a panic attack is coming. I know you see a counsellor at Counselling Services, but I've always found their services to be sub-par and I highly recommend Delton Glebe counselling (it's right next to Laurier and is pretty affordable - you can even see a practicum student for only $20 a session).

I'd recommend this if you really feel like you don't have enough CS experience. Use that time to study on your own, come up with some projects, apply for software internships. I've seen some guy's LinkedIn profile and he had either 7 or 8 different internships before working FT.

"How about you go next to her and ask if theres anyone sitting in the seat beside her. If not, sitdown and complain about the course. Everyone loves trash talking about hard courses so that is a good conversation starter. Then after class ends ask if she has a class right after. If not ask if she wants to go grab some coffee. Theres your first mini date. If it goes well get her number and properly ask her out. Literally works everytime fam dont pull this dumbass pencil shit lmao."
"Yea loads of people are just terrible at wording things precisely. I'm pretty bad at using language properly too so I'm extra careful about things that people have told me are problematic (obvs I still fuck up sometimes lol) and try my best to help others not make mistakes too :D

I think another thing is that ppl need to realize that you saying something racist != you're a racist because accidental racism is just like, accidental and you can fix your behavior and it's all good."
"1. Inject some references to current events. You could have a cannabis theme, for instance. 
2. Create some on-going narrative that the assignment questions refer to. For example, introduce a protagonist and antagonist (e.g. Gister Moose and Haridun Famdullahpur) and have the questions act as a lens onto some kind of feud/conflict that's resolved in the final. Maybe make the test cases reveal secrets or dialogue, lol. 
3. Acknowledge excellent performances. Jeffrey Shallit does this, and it does make the class more exciting to be reminded that you're competing for recognition (the classic ""notice me, senpai""). Maybe mention what the historical record for a particular assignment question has been. Challenge students to beat it.

"Climate science hasn't changed much, Statoil a decade ago gave the same startling numbers CBC did the other night. 

&amp;#x200B;

The verdict then was that we need to do a lot more than we are if we want to have a habitable world.

&amp;#x200B;

The verdict now is that we haven't done everything we needed to, predictions are coming true, and we need to do one hell of a lot more than we already are.

This isn't the research from a decade ago out of Statoil that I read, but its the same oil company, and their position on oil reflects the research they've done, in the contexts of moving forward:

"I really dont give a fuck if they hate more or not. If I feel i deserve better damn straight Im going to speak to them. Of course Im not going to them begging for a grade boost, Im asking because I have a legitimate qualm with how they have marked something. If their ego is too fragile to handle my critique then dont be a TA. I do agree with you that people should seek clarification beforehand, but sometimes you feel certain that you'v done a great job and then bam you see a shockingly bad grade. In this scenario Im going to go down swinging. Getting into law school is not easy, I'll take every % I can get. And seriously, what pedestal are you standing on telling people not to go fight for their grades. Thats just absurd too me. "
"The questions that they asked were fair, but the time that they gave us, i honestly think we needed another full hour. I really don't think it would even be possible to finish that exam if you knew the answers ahead of time and had them memorized, let alone read a question that's a page or more longer, than write a page or twos worth of code involving constructors, etc.

That f'king addroom question took me forever to write. I knew what I was writing too. between building the ctor, dtor, etc, wtf is wrong with them. As if I haven't been getting destroyed on the assignments as it is?

I really have to step my game up in this course clearly... Don't know how though, I put at least 60 hours into A3 and didn't even finish half of it."
"Yeah I honestly don't understand this ""just go for it!!"" advice that's given out, seems to be at odds with social norms.

I once asked out a girl I met on co-op and had been hanging out with for a few weeks, she politely declined and when talking after she asked why, I said she was smart, funny, friendly, and good-looking, and she basically said ""well there's a lot of people like that out there, so just anyone is fine then?""

And literally almost the exact same conversation happened with a girl I had been seeing for a few weeks who I met on Tinder, when she asked what I liked about her.

So that's why it's really confusing to me when people give encouragement to ask someone out when all the person knows about her is ""she's cute."""
"&gt; What are your plans?

Unfortunately, they're a secret, because now they're also a reality.

&gt; Is this something you give a lot of thought to?

i've thought a great deal about whether I would like to accept the invitation that random chance has put onto my plate.  and the answer is a resounding ""yes"".  In fact, I couldn't have designed this outcome better, even if designing our own outcome were possible.

&gt; I used to have grand dreams

You still do have grand dreams, my dear Humpty, of course you still have them.

&gt; but now I'm not so sure what I'll do.

This is simply the recalibration that comes with experience.  The manifestations of your dreams are being modified by your experience of reality.  this is a good thing.

&gt; Personally I don't know if I'll be able to do anything amazing

When you have negative thoughts like this, just remember that you have already [accomplished something amazing](https://youtu.be/1dItl1tvYRA).

&gt;  I think that even if you work for some corporation, where the work isn't very meaningful, you can still help our your community in small ways, and even that's worthwhile. 

Read your quote again here, Humpty.  ""I think..."", ""you work..."", ""you can still...""  When you think or say things in this way, catch yourself, and change it to ""me statements"":  

""*I* think that even if *I* work for some corporation, where the work isn't very meaningful, *I* can still help our community in small ways.""

Yes my dear, I believe you are correct, I believe you can help any community - however where you are wrong is that YOU can help in BIG ways, in the long term...  Don't underestimate yourself, my dear, I sense strongly in your humility the ability to change the world - humility like the Aga Khan, Ghandi, Jesus, and others, real or imagined.

&gt; Plus you could use some of that corporate money you made to do good

Are you trying to convince me, or yourself?  Also, me statements: ""*I* could use some of that corporate money *I* made to do good.""

&gt; it is kinda our responsibility to use those skills wisely.

Me statement: ""It is kinda *MY* responsibility to use those skills wisely."" I'm glad you see things that way.  Take ownership of your reality.  Entropy only works in one direction - therefore, be smrt: [Don't save anything for the swim back](https://youtu.be/KyUiPN2HS5c).

"If you’re in 1A of engineering, then maybe talk to your academic advisor about entering the reduced load program. It’s normally offered after midterms (since they will recommend it to people based on their midterm scores). You will be able to drop 3 of your courses and finish the rest in the summer time. Only thing is your program would take an extra year longer. But if you want to keep studying, without the stress of so many courses right now, that could be a viable option. "
"The key here is that it is biologically off putting, so they are not completely/immediately aware of it. It is likely not off putting enough to say no to a date with a hot girl, but it can affect your later attraction to her, especially if she also texts you first after the date and takes over the male role even more. It can also lead to questioning your attraction after the date, but not realizing it has to do with her taking the masculine role.

TLDR; it happens subconsciously."

"As an alumni I will say to you that if you got in your not stupid.   But you are suffering classic mental fatigue symptoms.  You will get lots of advice from students but your much better off to talk with a medical professional.  As some others have pointed out perhaps your study methodologies are also doing you in.

People need variation, some more then others.  Some can go for hours without a break, others need frequent breaks, with activity, between study sessions.   There have been recent studies of children with attention issues where they put them on a treadmill for 15 minutes and then had them immediately sit down to do math, and they did much better.

So I would suggest to you that if what you are doing now is not working then you need to switch it up.

But I also suggest do talk to a psychologist.   They are trained specifically for this stuff, and can identify and help you get on the right path far quicker then we armchair warriors.

Good luck and let us know what you do."
"As an alum and adult parent of someone now attending UWat I am horrified by what is proposed.  My first thought was ""stalker"" and my second thought was how could anyone have gotten to 4th yr, particularly in a co-op program, and not managed to develop enough interpersonal and relationship skills that they lack the ability to develop relationships appropriately?

I say to you all that if you like someone it is never a good idea to blindside them.  You should be testing the waters in conversation and hopefully have enough acumen to determine if there is even a modest spark of personal interest.  If so you might suggest to them should you believe there is mutual attraction that you get together to study or hit up the coffee shop together.  Be cool, be gentle, do not be aggressive.  And don't be upset if it is a no - a responsible and mature individual recognizes that it is not always in the cards.  If you get a ""no"" just chill, and be polite and easy going about it. They will respect that a lot more and might even come back at a later date remembering that you were not the creep in the group.

I hope this is just a ""shitpost"" as if it is not then honestly I am scared for the place the OP is at.  And even more scared for the young lady."

"NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was a trade agreement between Canada, the USA, and Mexico from the 90's, and part of that agreement defined TN visas.

TN visas are the visas that allow skilled professionals to work in the other countries in the agreement. So those are the visas that Canadians need if they want to work in the states for a tech job. It's important because there's no limit to the number of them. If somebody that isn't a citizen of Canada or Mexico tries to get a tech job in the states, they have to hope that they get one of a limited number of H1B visas, which are what we would also need from Canada if USCMC didn't exist. There are some other differences between the visas but not really important. "
"First thing to do: don't panic.

&amp;#x200B;

This happens. I wrote 341 Tuesday and similarly, I understood the material and totally bombed it. 68% of people who responded to the Piazza poll said the exam was hard or too hard. So you're not alone in feeling like it was difficult or didn't go well.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, it's spilled milk until the exam marks come back - no sense worrying about it until the marks come back, because you can't change your answers or know how much damage the mark did until it's back. Just focus on the assignments. The midterm was only worth 25% and assignments are worth 30%, so getting solid grades across all the assignments will help make up the marks. Do the assignment due Tuesday and go from there.

&amp;#x200B;

When the midterm comes back, look for any remark possibilities (within reason, don't just reach for marks you can't get). If there was something you didn't understand, ask your prof, learn from the mistake, and move forward.

&amp;#x200B;

The shitty thing is, we won't know if the final is easier until we write it. Only thing to do now is keep moving forward.

"So dealing with doctors requires a light touch, a lot of them are really resistant to patients who come in with their own problem already diagnosed.  This breaks the flow of how they practice medicine, and they tend to close down when it happens.

In general: 

* Describe your symptoms, not your illness.  Don't say ""I have an ear infection."" say ""I have a cough, a runny nose, and headaches.'

* Describe previous treatments effects, not their failures. Don't say 'The last time I talked to a doctor about my ear infection, he thought it was the flu, told me to drink a lot of fluids and rest' instead say: ""I was treated for these symptoms by being told to drink lots of fluids and rest, I've been following those instructions for 2 weeks, but my symptoms aren't improving"".

* Provide health history information for context, but do so carefully: Don't say ""I get ear infections every winter, whenever I have flu like symptoms + this kind of headache, I know it's not a cold"", instead ""I've had ear infections before, and the symptoms feel really similar to these, especially the kind of headache i'm experiencing"".

* When you think your doctor might be missing something: This can be delicate, but in general, ask questions rather than make requests. Don't say ""Can you take a peek in my ear, it's probably infected."" instead ""I know a lot of my symptoms have different causes, is there anyway you can quickly rule out something like an ear infection? I've had a history with them.'

With doctors, it's important to understand your role in the diagnosis procedure.  You are talking about needing surgery before even meeting with a specialist. Which, hey, I don't know you, or your symptoms, but I do know doctors are really off put by patients talking like that."
"&gt; the only thing that i can think of that will change next term are the profs. not sure how big of a factor profs play in this course but i've tried every prof teaching this term and none of them have failed to confuse me

You likely won't find a better prof for this course than Postle. Maybe Pei or Haxell? If anything you'll have a more difficult time next semester WRT profs.

Honestly not really sure what to say. If you literally cannot start the assignment in any capacity without going to the tutorial centre it sounds like your current learning strategies aren't getting the job done.

&gt; seeing that your in 4a, do you have any tips for managing this course load?

I don't know anything about how you spend your time so I can't really give you any advice. Specific to the courses:

* STAT 230 is not complicated. You literally don't even have to understand what you're doing to get a decent grade in this course. Just go to lecture and do the practice problems until you master the material, there isn't anything else to it.
* CS 245 is pretty much the same as what I said for STAT 230.
* CS 246 admittedly takes a lot of effort. I'll put an upper bound on assignment time to completion at 20 hours, if it takes longer than that then you simply aren't spending that 20 hours effectively. Probably spending half the time spinning your wheels or on reddit. If this is taking a lot of your time, just go sit at a library for 10 hours each Saturday and Sunday and do the entire assignment.
* MATH 239 is a pain but you just need to read over the content before the lecture, go to lecture, and reinforce what you learned **the same day** by going over the content and doing some practice problems. If you find yourself just learning the concepts necessary for an assignment the same day you're doing said assignment, you're not learning effectively. Fix that.

It really isn't that special of a course load to manage, just take a good long look at how and where you're spending your time and correct as necessary."

What do you mean! We have several pup crawls and house parties for those interested. And there's some fall themed goodness over at Snyder's Farm. Though I've never been I hear it's great.  Plus there is Oktoberfest but that's passed.
"For someone who's been out of uni for several years, TIL University etiquette - it is rude to reserve seats in a packed classroom. 

Same thing can be said for public transit - in a bus/train full of commuters, will you take your belongings off from your adjacent seat? Or, if you're sitting on a blue seat while riding ttc, will you give up that seat to someone from higher priority group?

"The [Waterloo Engineering site](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/about/faculty-engineering-statistics) has some undergrad enrollment numbers for Fall 2017. It ranks 13/14 for number of students enrolled: 112. Compare that to 1182 in Computer Engineering, 639 in Chemical or 913 in Mechatronics. They also have a site for [Admission Averages](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/future-undergraduate-students/application-process/admission-averages). Of course this is subject to change depending on the competitiveness of students applying that year. For Fall 2019 enrolment the website has a minimum admission average listed as:

- 85-89 = 45% chance of receiving offer
- 90-94 = 85% chance of receiving offer
- 95+ = 95% chance of receiving offer

"Knowledge is control.  see /r/personalfinancecanada.  The solution is to implement a budget - plan your spending, then track your spending and modify your plan accordingly.  Some of the items in your budget should be 'entertainment and eating out'.  

that'll tell you how much you have to spend on entertainment (and groceries).  It'll give you the knowledge that your commitments are covered so there's no problem spending on entertainment - so go ahead and do it without feeling guilty.  IF you've got $50 to spend on entertainment, go spend $50 knowing full well that everything else is looked after.  

Generally the problem is too much on entertainment and not enough on debt/living costs, but the reverse situation that you're in is still solved the same way.  Plan what you're spending, stick to it for the most part, and when you don't stick to it you do so knowing exactly what you're giving up.  

The Canadian school system has long been criticized for not teaching students how to budget."
"&gt;It's like the ""it's okay to be white"" thing, its so effective because it is true and yet the current media/political/social environment requires white people to not reproduce and to be ashamed rather than proud of their heritage.

Because it is also just dog whistling. It is a meaningless phrase because there was never any scenario where it wasn't ""ok to be white"". That you connect it to ""ashamed rather than proud of their heritage"" is also disconcerting since there is no such thing as ""white"" heritage (especially since people talking about ""white"" heritage tend to just mean ""their"" heritage), not to mention what counts as ""white"". I presume we need to get rid of Oktoberfest considering it isn't Anglo-Francophone right?

I am disappointed you are subscribing to conspiracy theories that you think media/political/social environment is trying to make white people not produce. That is some Alex Jones level stuff.

&gt; Mass migration has become a lucrative business for a small group of people, and anything that threatens to undermine that profit makes this group lash out with smears whose goal is to destroy cultures and leave a void that can be filled with their empty purposeless validation-seeking degenerate lifestyle.

"Is this comment directed at me, or at the general reader? I hope it's the latter because most of it does not relate to anything I said. Either way, here's my attempt at a response.

&gt;It's really a ""grass is greener on the other side"" type of thing

Yes, the grass always seems greener, but here's the thing. It's very uncommon for people to actively try to make themselves look worse, but it's very common for people to try to make themselves look better. If attractive people truly think ugly people have it better, why don't they try to make themselves ugly? Or are they just thinking about the few ways attractive people have it worse, while acknowledging that life as a whole is better if you are attractive?

&gt;Chad Thundercock might be getting laid but when he isn't, do remember he's going to bed alone with no progeny and will likely do so for a very long time to come unless he grows up and treats women like people.

Sure, and when he grows up and treats women like people he'll have a very easy time starting a family and living happily ever after. Meanwhile an ugly man who ""treats women like people"" will still struggle immmensely with this.

&gt;Your porn-riddled fantasy of Chad Thundercock is brainwashing. 

What fantasy would that be?"
"Summary: 

* Review and Q&amp;A with the Auditor for the last Fiscal Year

* Appointing the new Auditor (re-appointment of MNP, LLC).

* Bylaw reforms from the Fall 2017 AGM's Special _ad hoc_ Committee for GM Engagement and Council Reforms (ie. the Task Force) -- these are set to increase accountability of the Board to Council and Members, make it easier to recall and remove poor directors and Councillors and Exec, and increase member control over Feds and engagement, and bring us into compliance with the Corporations Act). **DISCLAIMER:** I was on this committee.

* Director Proposed bylaw amendment to remove the voting seats of VP Student Life and VP Education on the Board of Directors (these positions are not overseen by the Board, but rather Council); this was submitted by Director Beauchemin.

* Health &amp; Dental Plan and GRT UPass Eligibility. (member submitted motion)

* Budgets &amp; Appropriations reform. This motion aims to bring all confidential budgets of the organization under review by the Budget &amp; Appropriations Committee so students get accountable oversight to them. (member submitted motion)

* Commercial Services motion. This motion aims to require Commercial services to budget for surplus and use that surplus to reinvest back into undergrads through (a) transferring said surpluses to the Federation’s general operating fund, (b) By offsetting increases to the dues paid by members, or (c) For capital improvements of and reinvestment in the commercial services themselves. (Member submitted motion)

* Discussion item on what's going on with the Off-Campus Shuttle Service.

* Discussion item on reducing University ancillary and incidental student fees.

EDIT: misspoke about the Board voting seats! Please excuse this."

"How long have you had the TD cash back card?

* If less than 6 months: wait until you've had it for 6 months.

* If more than 6 months: get a credit card with a different credit card company (e.g. if you have a visa, get a mastercard). I would recommend the Rogers Mastercard if you have a Rogers, Fido or Chatr account, or if you frequent the Rogers Centre for Blue Jays games. It's 1.25% cash back for CAD purchases, and 4% cash back for non-CAD purchases (less a 2.5% fx fee, net 1.5%). "

"You'll need an 80 average, but yes. 

If you clear an 80% in the Euclid you'll get in if your marks are marginally competitive (90%+)

If you have a &gt;95% in the Euclid and get below an 80% average they'll probably make an exception but ask questions.

In general though, Euclid/CSMC marks tend to correlate strongly with marks, especially towards the ""amazing"" end. 

To be clear, a 70 won't make much of a difference, which is great, but a 80 would. The average is somewhere around 50. "
"yeah i already took the exam and it was pretty easy... i would say that around 40% of the materials is from pmbok which u can find online. just google pmbok pdf. there are a few variations but it seems like most of the charts with inputs, outputs, tools and techniques are fairly similar.

the exam doesnt go too much in detail with the pmbok either so just i think it’s safe to say that having a surface level understanding of each process groups is sufficient to at least pass the exam."
"I'm not going to vote, and i didn't comment on your initial post? Why not, let's talk about it. 

I'm not involved with the municipality beyond tangential relationships. I use the roads, I maybe take two buses. If the buses got stopped entirely, I'd be fine. 

&gt;50% of my life is adjacent to phillip st, &gt;90% within 5km of the university (only so far for groceries, otherwise I'd say within 3km). Almost all of the area has no bearing on me.

I'm spending (hopefully) less than 2 years of the rest of my life in Kitchner-Waterloo-Cambridge Area, I'm not a long term user. 

My votes would determine things that certainly won't have long term implications on my life, won't have much short term implications on my life either, but could have a meaningful change to other people. 

In your previous post

&gt;  If feds negotiate a trade deal you’ll feel that in a year or two. If buses stopped, police stopped, hydro stopped... you’d notice.

I doubt any politician would stop hydro/police, and I doubt my life would descend into anarchy if it stopped briefly (I already stockpile water, and why would criminals want anything to do with me? I think I have maybe 3-4 things worth over $100 tops) 

So tell me, even if it's my right, why should I vote?"
"Status Quo with a bit of rebranding

This university most likely ranks at the very bottom in terms of social interactions between students (it's not measurable but observable for sure). We talk about increasing social activities and what not, yet we're considering to close down or limit quite possibly the #1 source of social activities on campus. Bomber should be viewed as a student service more than it is a business.

That doesn't mean it can't be a successful business. It's a fully equipped bar on campus, can't see anything that can be more lucrative. There's definitely problems in the way it's managed and operated.

I, myself, can see some obvious problems without even looking at the numbers or making a full analysis:

* Why would you close a bar at 8-9pm? I bet the amount of drinks ordered between 8pm and 2am at other bars dwarfs the rest of the day. If I'm going out for drinks with friends, do you think I would do it at 3pm?

* Why close on Saturday?

* I get that ""Bomber Wednesday"" has been going on for a while, but its popularity is dwindling and you're competing with Phils. Why not do something on Saturday?

* Company dinners for co-ops and similar events can probably be optimized. I've seen info sessions there but not much else.

"For someone who claims to have been committed to a psych ward on three occasions and lost numerous close friends and friends of family members via suicide, you lack a certain degree of empathy that I often see in people who have suffered with mental illness for a long time.

Yes, suicide often happens without the person saying a word to anyone else. However, many times suicide also *doesn't* happen because the person *did* make their struggles public. It isn't attention-whoring, you fucking moron--it's a cry for help when a person genuinely feels like there is nobody out there that cares about them. Yes, there are always going to be people who make facetious posts and attention-whore for the sake of personal gain, **but** assuming that every public broadcasting of one's struggles is a deliberate attempt to get attention only trivializes the struggle of people who suffer from mental illness.

When people make a post online, it may very well lead to them getting the help or support they need to overcome their depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, etc., to the point where they can live a normal life again. In that case, they can whore attention all they want--I'm just happy that they'll finally be getting the help they need.

As a whole, you are extremely condescending and you lack a tremendous level of empathy and understanding--for that, I call bullshit on your ""personal experiences"" with mental illness. You know nothing about the ""string of causality"" or ""progression"" of mental illness. Furthermore, your claims do absolutely nothing to remove the stigma around mental illness, and around speaking openly about one's struggles with their mental health.

As someone who *has* attempted and eventually was lucky to receive the help they needed, I can 100% guarantee that you *do* notice when your mind is going in a bad direction, and that some people *do* think to themselves: ""I could really use some help."" The challenging part is *not* realizing that you need help; the challenging part is actually building up the courage to speak openly enough to *get that help*.

""My dear,"" I wish you would stop addressing others as ""kid"" when you know nothing of how old they are or what their level of maturity is. You are, quite literally, a moron hiding behind a keyboard with no desire to have a rational or open discussion to others' viewpoints--you just assume that your own ""experiences"" (again, I question the validity of your personal experiences) are reflective of every other mentally-ill individual. Are you so dense as to assume that every other mentally-ill individual suffers the same way that you do? If you were half as brilliant as you try to make yourself seem, you'd realize that mental illness is incredibly complex and does not affect everyone the same.

The only mental illness you suffer from is narcissism, my dude. But any other mental illness? Questionable. You're too dense to have really suffered from any serious loss or struggle in your life.

Either that, or you're just a fucking asshole.

Fuck you."

Don't worry too much ive gotten low 60s in midterms worth 25-40% and still ended with a 75% in the course so a 15% quiz isn't too big of a deal. I'd recommend seeing what you did wrong on the quiz and maybe even talking to your prof  .

"To add to above, it's a new responsibility on the presidential portfolio so there will be a bit of transition period.

Personally I've gone from 0-60 involvement in Feds real quick, but when you're ""an expert"" in one Society's policy and procedure it's a bit of a learning curve to catch up on an entire other organization and keep pace with both in order to represent your students properly.

"A guy not asking you out is not a sign that he's not interested. If he stops texting you, *that's* a sign that he isn't interested.

Guys typically won't ask a girl out unless they believe she will say yes. It's more likely that he's scared. If a guy keeps texting you without asking you out, that usually means he's interested but he's not sure that you'll say yes so he plays it safe.

I sure hope that I'm not that ugly but I feel ugly every time I see my reflection. No girl has ever said she likes me so that's a thing I guess.

"I hate to bring this up now but what happened to your mom is completely unacceptable.

"If the guys there were gawking at the girls who lived in that house, that means they were unusually attractive and not the norm.

Of course, you can always compare yourself to people prettier than you and work towards becoming that pretty if that's something you care about, but there are so many other things you can value yourself with! You're at UW (i'm assuming), so you're really smart and probably put in alot of time studying! Being able to make it to UW is really impressive and alot of people would be super jelly of your acomplishment. Being pretty is ALOT more work than most people think and unless you want to make how you look your career, why spend so much time and effort on it? Study hard and get a great job after university and you can date other people in your field with similar interests as you. 

If you're looking for a guy to marry, don't look for a guy who cares about how you look - even supermodels look like bloated whales when they're pregnant and you don't want someone who's gunna dump you for not being hot if you're pregnant/sick/old/etc.  

Things are gunna be ok! You'll find someone to date and marry and you're gunna get more self confidence as you settle into adulthood.

And climate scientists have an incentive to keep up the fear mongering since their funding depends on people taking them seriously.

No one wants to admit that their job is a waste of time.

"1) Traffic calming on feeder streets onto king, even heavily painted crossings or yellow flashers would go a long way in slowing people down coming off the expressway; make single occupant vehicle commuting to the core as frustrating as possible while providing alternatives (ie park at conestoga and ride the LRT).

2) Connect and prioritize MUP corridors (all of the MUP crossings currently give priority to cars with stop signs on the MUP and typically no signage on the road, lots of MUPs, like the laurel trail which terminates on the part of university without any bike lanes, abandon users on busy roads). 

3) Make developers give back to the region by pushing them to redevelop neglected properties (Terry Good specials, the Laurel tenements, the electrohome factory) or forcing them to add space for the types of destinations (restaurants with sidewalk patios, park space, etc) that would make a place like midtown somewhere anyone would want to go instead of giving them a 0 setback building permit (like the midtown condos has). This should be contextual as well; if you have a development or rental in the U district, how are you helping to manage move-out waste, or the hoco/st paddy's day shitshows. 

Maybe those would be good places to start. "
"The difference is that Bert's statement puts the importance on race, while Allen's comment puts the importance on the individual character traits. The set of characters that Allen likes is also pretty much impossible to be satisfied by every single East Asian girl that exists, so there's also no more uncertainty that ""East Asian"" is the only criteria to be liked. 

Of course, hearing what Bert says might not upset every East Asian girl, but many people would feel like they're being devalued to a member of a group instead of being an individual, especially if it's said by the person they're dating. 

Bert can say that statement, which is a racist statement because it implies that he'd think about a group of people differently based on their race, without actually being racist himself - he might just not know how to word his thoughts better.  I don't think it's a big thing to call someone out for having said something problematic because everyone has said something bad at some point in their life and we're all hopefully improving and trying to hurt other people less every day.

Edit: To add: Someone just told me another reason yellow fever is problematic is that it feeds into the whole ""all [East] Asians are the same"" thing that's common in North America, even tho there's differences in culture, trends and physical appearances between different groups. So when Bert says ""I like East Asian girls"", he's feeding into that stereotype even if he doesn't mean to, which many people don't appreciate. "
"&gt; I certainly wouldn't want to live with my family anymore either, probably for different reasons but yea.

Actually I'd love to spend some time living with, or at least fairly close to my parents. I moved out when I was barely 14 and I feel like they missed out on most of my formative years. They are very supportive. I'm actually going for a partially remote option for my full-time job so I can spend a few months living in East Asia every year. The reason why I don't call where my parents live home is that I didn't forge many meaningful relationships/friendships there and I also wasn't born there.

&gt; My classes for years have been completely dominated by Asian students, sometimes up to 95% (I've counted). My current program is at around 80% minimum.

&gt; I guarantee some crybaby is going to call me racist in response to this post

I mean, I'm in CS, I'm international, I'm 100% East Asian, I agree with you 100%, and I don't think that's racist in the slightest. Truth is, this is *not* normal. I've been to several universities in Europe, and their CS schools are pretty much all native/domestic students. 

&gt; having very light-handed punishments for plagiarism and other things international students are known for

The fact that the STAT 443 cheaters only got partial marks docked off their projects speaks volumes to this. I've personally seen how rampant plagiarism and cheating are among international students (many of my international friends do on a daily basis).

&gt; It's a good economic model... But it sacrifices literally every other part of life for the sake of monetary gain. That's essentially Canada's national model today.

Which is one of the reasons why I will be leaving this country immediately after graduation. Living here isn't fun.

&gt; Why would there be? This University is about funneling students to other places, and there are barely any (what I would call) 'legitimate' Canadians here to actually create anything resembling a community.

Fair point. I see UW as a trade school and a trade school only. It opens a lot of doors for me career wise but that's it.

&gt; I would think that this school is actually pretty awesome and full of life, if you're Asian... there are dozens of clubs, restaurants, and all sorts of unique services at your disposal. And you're surrounded by peers who had similar upbringings to you, share your cultural, social, and spiritual values etc.

I hate to be that guy, but I absolutely despise it when people think all Asian people are the same and share the same social and cultural values. It's like saying Norwegians and Greeks are the same when they are almost polar opposites in terms of personality and values in reality. I actually have a hard time trying to fit into the East Asian community here, precisely because my values are so different from the prevailing values the majority of the international students (mostly rich Chinese kids whose parents think Canada is the bastion of rationality, kindness, and beyond) have here. Also the food here is pretty shite.

&gt; Same here, oddly enough. Although I didn't move very far. I am leaving Waterloo in a few months and it's forcing me to 're-discover' who I am, and it has been a gut-wrenching experience.

Good for you, I have to say. It will be worth it. The best decision I've made over my years at UW is that I decided to forgo fat paycheques down south and move to Europe for a co-op. It was an eye-opening journey of self-discovery.

&gt; I feel like this place was trying to force me to conform to a certain way of life that was just impossible for me to take on, so it has been a horrible experience over all and I would never recommend it to anyone

"I've used TutorConnect to find tutors before, and I really like it. You'll find a good variety of people, ranging from upper years to masters/phd students, and they usually have a good variety of rates so you can find something that fits your budget. 

The tutor was good to fill the gaps from lectures, and helped me get to the next step when doing assignment problems when I was stuck. There was definitely improvement in that regard, especially since they would often probe me the questions I should be asking myself when approaching problems, and that helped a lot when on an exam. 

In terms of hours, it would vary based on how many questions I had from my assignments, and how close we were to an exam. Good range would be 2-3 hours per week?"
"Jeez...and I though that 75/month at KW4Rent was expensive (after they outsourced to HonkMobile), until I learned my co-op workplace in suburban Toronto charges 110/month!! (Ontario gov't also outsourced and raised the price to encourage carpooling to work)

I'm thinking the landlord companies drive up prices for their ""luxury suites"" in Waterloo so only rich international students with Mercedes and BMW's rent their parking spots at unimaginable rates - even carpooling home every weekend wouldn't recover that much cost for typical students.

I guess it's better to live at a house further from campus (assuming free parking there) and buy a UW parking permit for $160/term or 40/month, with the cost of fuel of driving to class being worth it."
"Sounds like for you it could be very viable.

Another plan, while more time intensive, may be to learn at your own pace *ahead* of time and attend the lectures.

You may find it easier to pay attention and keep up with the lecture material if you're already familiar with the material.

There are two main risks of learning on your own:

1. Time management becomes far more difficult. Most students cannot manage their time well enough to stay comfortably on top of the course. It's just plain *difficult* to teach yourself the material while also keeping on top of assignments and balancing your other needs. Having set lecture times adds just enough structure for most students to succeed. You'd be sacrificing that structure.

2. Missed details or ""quirks"" that the prof talks about and covers in detail that aren't part of the textbook, or are only skimmed in the text. You risk not hearing about these and showing up to an exam unprepared.

I suggest only trying this for one or two classes to start."
"&gt;IQ and socioeconomic

I suppose it is possible that socioeconomic has some impact on IQ and not just the other way, since how you are raised may influence your IQ. For example, if your parents don't spend very much time teaching you to count, speak, play music, etc then your development could be stunted resulting in your actual intelligence becoming farther and farther from your intellectual capacity as time progresses. So my question would be, is IQ a measure of your actual intelligence or your potential intelligence? 

&gt;Building up wealth

I'm a bit skeptical about how much wealth is directly passed on to the next generation. How much you save or invest versus immediately spending also has a significant impact on your wealth. You can make a lot of money and not have very much wealth, or can make an average amount and still have a decent amount of wealth when you're older so I don't think wealth is the best way to compare opportunities or productivity versus reward for different groups. 

&gt;School funding

Do we or do we not want a united country? Black Americans can probably make a reasonable case that they should at least have the opportunity to be on the in, but imo it's difficult to make that case if you show up uninvited.

"I personally prefer NYC over SF. It’s not even close.

But I’ll try to be objective and hide my bias a little bit. Here are the NYC pros:

* Transit is as convenient as it’s going to get on this continent, and having a pass is a real game-changer compared to paying $6-8 for every short lyft ride in SF which could really add up.
* City is more diverse in profession. Not a tech bubble.
* All roads (and trains, and planes) lead to NYC. Philly, Boston, DC are all convenient train rides away, and you can even get to hiking trails by commuter trains.
* Housing, while equally pricey on average, is easier to find and there are more alternatives if you don’t wanna pay $$$ to live in the lower half of Manhattan. Commuting from Brooklyn or Queens is so much more convenient and cheaper than commuting from…. Oakland? The subway really changes everything.
* More things to do. Specifically, more things to do that are also \_cheap\_. Almost every museum has a free or pay-as-you-wish day, you can get broadway tickets for cheap through lotteries, you can walk/bike on the bridges/in parks, the list goes on.
* Better food. Sure, the two are probably similar on east Asian food, but NYC has the upper hand on literally everything else. It’s not called New York pizza for nothing.
* NYC is safer. It’s not just an anecdotal feeling; the stats paint the same story. Amazing what happens to personal safety when every person, rich and poor, is walking on the street and taking the subway instead of some of them being tucked away in cars.
* Closer to Toronto/Waterloo if that’s home for you. Also, eastern time &gt; pacific time

SF advantages:

* More of your friends will probably end up there. But you can always be friends with other NYC interns, and there are always a sizable bunch of UW people who end up there. I’m the coop connection person for NYC this term and it seems like we have quite a well-knit crew here.
* Weather.
* Mountains and national parks nearby.
* More tech companies = more opportunities. "

"I cannot comment on the academic advising as I am an alumni and not in the know for the current situation although other threads lead me to believe there is a real quality issue with TA's at this time which has to be addressed.  

But I am also an employer, and IMHO these rankings are a joke.  That Simon Fraser and Victoria placed ahead of Waterloo in the comprehensive category tells me factors which are non-academic (such as student satisfaction) were a significant portion of the ranking system for this metric.  Macleans should hide their head in shame for publishing such dreck.

If your a student, I would suggest the only metrics that count for your consideration of where to obtain your education are Best Overall, Highest Quality, Most Innovative and Leaders of Tomorrow.  And here UofT and UWat dominate.  Given the huge size of UT and its preeminence worldwide in medicine its a bit of David vs Goliath for Waterloo vs UofT.  I would be interested to see the comparison of the two if you separated out medicine in the head to head comparison.  I bet UW would take first place in all 4 categories.

UBC is really not deserving of its position in those rankings but so many in Asia know UBC due to its west coast proximity and substantive Asian and SE asian/indian populations that I think the results are skewed.

Notice in the 4 rankings that employers and peer academics consider important Simon Fraser and Victoria are almost off the map.  Hence the idiocy of ranking either above UWat in the comprehensive ranking.  Again the telltale sign that many non-academic factors formed a substantive portion of the ranking methodology.

BTW, if your a student who has really been struggling at UW - the system, the competition, the teaching methodology or your just unhappy then look at some of the other schools that appear in those rankings.  Perhaps one of them such as Queens, Western, Ryerson, or Alberta might be a place where you can prosper.  None are near as tough as UWat but they are still good enough that when you walk out the door with degree in hand there will be a high degree of positivity attached to the education.

U Alberta has been doing very well in math competitions such as Putnam and I am thinking their math department is pretty strong.

I found the course a nice break from my first year CS courses, for sure. Similar things to say about 281 and 381 since they're basically all the same course."
"I've found that the department advisors (specifically for your program) are really good.

However, I've heard horror stories about faculty level advisors who have no idea what theyre talking about (ie. Trained to advise for life sci because its popular, but have no idea how to handle physics students. Or math advisors being extremely stingy while pmath advisors being nice and lenient).

Also, co-op advising and CECA in general just dont know anything about real life. That might be a factor."
"Those are two separate issues. We actually have an abundance of student housing— something like 2,000 empty units around campus that are being left unoccupied so that landlords don’t have to lower the market rent.

"@leemerr's edit is a good one. I believe that AFM 291 is only offered in Fall semesters, so if you drop it now you'll have to retake it in Fall 2019. There are 5 different AFM courses (I believe they are 231, 280, 241, 274, 211) which are mandatory to complete the program offered in the Spring 2019 semester for 2B AFM students (this is why 291 is not offered in the Spring).

  
I'd personally recommend not dropping the course unless you really feel you have to, although sometimes the extra year does help things! You could probably take 291 in Fall 2019 (3A), then 391 in Fall/Winter 2020 (4A), and 491 in Fall 2021 (4B). I'm not sure if you'd need to take extra courses on top of that to complete your other requirements though. Hope this helps!"

"Problem is with rich neighborhoods is that the houses are farther apart and theres less of them compared to your average suburb with semidetached, townhomes etc. So even though you haul in more candy per house you have an overall higher travel time between houses and theres normally less houses, so really it all evens out between rich neighborhoods w big bars and the average sized neighborhood with smaller houses that give out average Halloween candy.

I lived in one of those gated communities, the houses were a lot farther apart and the haul in was also smaller due to the fact a lot of these rich people dont bother to give out candy on halloween, the candy was always more plentiful in the housing area across from us where my friends lived. "

"&gt;

Most notably the website for FAUW doesn't reference a union under statute and regulation governed by the Ontario Labour Relations Board, the way the CUPE does. 

Also FAUW seems to be entirely regulated by Policy 76, particularly 2(A) https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-76#twoa

Further it looks like that governing agreement for the FAUW ([Memorandum of Agreement -- UW / FAUW](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/documents-potential-interest/memorandum-agreement-uw-fauw#recognition)) under *Recognition and Rights*, it doesn't seem to be a union, but rather a collective/association formed with permission of the University. This sentiment of existence with permission/by MoU seems to be further emphasized in the [Faculty Association of the University of Waterloo Constitution](https://uwaterloo.ca/faculty-association/sites/ca.faculty-association/files/uploads/files/fauw_constitution_approved_2018-04-05.pdf) which lists the organization as a product of the MoU and a consequence of the University's creation as approved by the Board of Governors under the *University of Waterloo Act*.

It would be political suicide not to condemn the attacks, and it would be a bad faith argument to say anyone in US politics wanted this, but it is likely a consequence of populist politics being used to push a hateful agenda.

"Perhaps you could look at the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words) to figure out what it stands for, and why it is a yikes. 

&gt; Fourteen Words, 14, or 14/88, **is a reference to slogans coined by white supremacist David Lane,[1] a founding member of the terrorist organization The Order**.[2] The terms were coined while he was serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for his role in violating the civil rights of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, who was murdered in June 1984.[3] The slogans were publicized through now-defunct 14 Word Press, founded in 1995 by Lane's wife to disseminate her husband's writings.[4][5]


&gt; Lane also **used the phrasing in other pamphlets including the ""14 points"" of his White Genocide Manifesto and further in his 88 Precepts essay, stressing his support for racial and ethnic religions, opposition to universal religions (such as Christianity), his opposition to miscegenation, his anti-Americanism,[5] and support for racial separatism**.[2][6][7] **Many of his concepts, ideology and values, *particularly* the Fourteen Words slogan,** are either inspired by or derived from Adolf Hitler's autobiographical book Mein Kampf.[8]

"" Neither is. Your concern is MUH NAZIS and all the other shit you're inferring from a sentence that isn't there ""

In case you didn't get this, the 14 words is effectively a neo-nazi slogan which you can infer from the entire symbolism of the statement, the origin of it, and its general use in modern society; to take the words entirely and soley at face value is disingenuous. 

It's like saying ""Your concern with these swastikas is MUH NAZIS and all the other shit you're inferring from a symbol isn't there, it's obviously just a misprint of the buddhist swastika"" "

Is this or is this not an ad populum argument?  If more people agree with something that it must be right?"

As for the reserved part, I'm pretty sure that's a positive because overcompensating confrontational attitudes are rather irksome. "
"Apply to all, go for CFM if you're still undecided by the time you have to make a decision. I think it's probably easiest for CFM students to transfer to the others.
A lot of people switch out of CFM, usually because they don't like finance."

It is very typical for a company to offer a job by going around WaterlooWorks. Tell them you accept the job (if you want it) but to complete the necessary steps on WaterlooWorks so that you don't accidentally get matched with a different job

"I'd love to take this to the Board as an idea to pursue when we get to that stage of our plan. If you can DM me any other details that would be relevant that could be nice, as I can defend it better if I know more (I'm not a businessy person, haha). Or if you want, you can email the chair of the board or the board as a whole with this idea and ask for it to be taken before the Board. Alternatively, reach out to your faculty councilor or your society's president or to Kurt MacMillan directly. "
"Only able to speak for what I've tried

1. Onezo, best bubble tea place around.  The tapioca is great, highly recommend the caramel milk tea
2. Sweet Dreams, also very good.  Comfy atmosphere, very nice staff, coffee as well.  I forgot the name, but there's a mango slushy sort of tea that's top tier
3. The Alley, fucking shit.  Tries way too hard to look fancy and the tea is mediocre at best.  Tapioca is pretty tasteless as well.  Also expensive af.  On top of that, the wait times are insane."
" Like I said...You have the lower body and you have no upper body, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the upper body, and you have no legs, you got a problem building your legs. You have the upper...you have the lower body and you don't have the upper body, the upper body, it is easier to build. So if you have the lower body and you don't have the upper body, it is easier to build the upper body. You have the upper body and you don't have the legs, you got a problem building the lower body... No, you don't understand. You have the upper body, but you don't have the lower body, you got a problem building downstairs. You got the up- legs on the bottom, it is easier to build on the top, so you don't have much as a problem. Yeah."
"Because fobs are so fucking annoying. The majority of mainlanders are just rude and there’s nothing more to it. I know a lot of Taiwanese or Hong Kong Cantonese people that hate mainlanders more than other people do which should say something about how hated they are. Not even racist but so many fobs flaunt their shitty sports cars and Gucci shirts and LV laptop cases like wtf is the point. Then some dude sits next to you in a lecture and has unclilped disgusting fucking nails and doesn’t shut the fuck up talkingto his fob buddy when everyone is trying to listen

Not saying all Chinese people are bad; I have friends from China that are respectful individuals. But that can be attributed to their long term exposure to the country vs. a fob. "
"None of the three current Waterloo trustees have worked in the WRDSB nor any other school board prior to being Trustees. Being a Trustee does not require you to have worked at the school board, nor do I believe it makes you significantly better of a candidate. My personal belief is that while my experience is relatively small, I do have more experience on a board than any candidate running, besides the incumbents. I also believe the experience of being a student is drastically underrated. Many Trustees across the province are over the age of 50 and haven't worked in education directly either. I don't believe age is a benefit at all, and if anything, makes it harder to empathize with the ever changing educational landscape and everyday student."
"First off, /u/uwpolicy71 thanks for sharing your story and I'm truly sorry you had to go through this. I just want to echo a point made by /u/leea0526 below; Feds is here to help students who are in situations like this but we can only do so if we know about it. As mentioned, we do have the Centre for Academic Policy Support (CAPS) to provide assistance in navigating academic policy issues that students may have. Furthermore, specifically on Co-op related concerns, as the CAC I am here to help any students that encounter issues/treated unfairly by the Co-op Department. Please email me at connor.plante@uwaterloo.ca anytime!

Also, just to specifically answer a question asked by /u/nax9 below, unfortunately UW does not have an Ombudsman. Grievances or petitions under Policy 70 and 72 are really the only formal mechanisms students have to submit complaints. (Although, the Ontario Ombudsman does have jurisdiction over publicly funded universities to investigate complaints so that is an option).    "
"About 3 years ago i got free liquid soap samples in costo (in warden). They were handing it out in mini capsules and I got like 4 of them. They were promoting a new brand. I think it was simple happiness co. or smthing. It had orange color and scent of tangerine/orange/mango mixed. It smelled amazing. I wanted to try them on my next shower so after I get home I put them on that nice rack thingy that you stick onto shower wall to put your shampoo etc. Anyways I forgot to use them for long time. They just stood there for months. 

One of our neighbours were leaving. I think they were moving to vancouver but I didn't care. I didn't like them that much but I didn't hate them either. They were ok I guess. They were kinda old.  They sold their house pretty fast cuz that blue real estate poster only remained on their front yard for a few days. The new neighbours moved in. They were brown (the prev. ones were white). Brown neighbours were ok too I guess, I didn't really care. They'd leave their shoes outside of the maindoor and leave their door open. My room's window looks directly to the street, it kinda looks directly to their house. They had a giant TV in their living room. When they left the door open, I could see that giant TV. It was summer and it was pretty hot. I had AC in my house so I didn't care but sometimes I'd just doze off thinking and finding myself staring at that TV watching whatever indian movie they're watching. They seem to have quality family time. I think they had large dinners with whole fam included (grandpa-grandchildren). A while later I introduced myself to formally welcome them. I told them I'm living in that house over there and gave my phone number. Then again I didn't really care but it's nice to know your neighbours, you never know. They had owned two cars. I dont really find cars interesting so I dont remember what brand they were but one was white and other was gray. The white car was better, the gray was like lame. These guys were getting a lot of visitors. Their front door was always full of shoes, they were getting 20+ people in their house every day. They were never being loud. Prior to this I joined a bbq party that one of my neighbours were having. The guy had very expensive bbq and he cooked some good stuff which wa"

I'm really bad with names...  For all the bullshit I spout about remembering people's faces, I'm fucking bad at it.. well, i guess there are no faces here.. so I'm off the hook...  but I'd also like to give special shout outs to these peeps, maybe you guys can help me remember their usernames:

(n+ 0)- the guy who has ""MOD"" in his flair, but is not actually a mod.  You're actually a good sport.  [You bring peace to the world](https://youtu.be/cTBx-hHf4BE).  I wish it were possible we could meet in real life, something about you makes me certain you're a great guy, like most people on this sub. 

(n + 1) ""pseudonym"", or ""tsudonim"", tsu-dah-nym...  What's your fucking name?  The guy who did ecstasy on a golf course?  I always remember your face as つ だ に ん , because somehow I think you're phillipino, or Vietnamese?  so clearly you'd have a Japanese homonytic username right?  hahaha, I want to do mushrooms with you on the Rio Amacayacu, where I'll be in just over a month.  If you can find me, [I will buy you a ticket](https://youtu.be/4zLfCnGVeL4), that's the only promise that'll come from me to you in our lifetimes. (unless you find me)

(n + 2) chuckyyucker?  what's his name, what's his name?  he doesn't say much.  Is he in CS?  he said something to me [about a year ago](https://youtu.be/G58XWF6B3AA), and I'd just like to assure him/you that I did finish my app, so for all the disparaging I do of sideprojects, well.  i guess I have one too --  open sourced it though because I don't have time to maintain it myself...  you're a good sport, my dear

(n + 3) /u/waterloogod - or whatever your name is now.  YOu never posted a thing publicly.  I hope you find what you're looking for, which probably means some else finds what their looking for first.

(n + 4) /u/shybutalsokindacute - ok I think I actually got your username correct.  In my mind, you're like the [guy the third from the left](https://i.imgur.com/gbIj39s.jpg), the only one who knows he doesn't need to be checking Tinder right now.  But of course, those guys are on the other team, nonetheless, [I wish you sweet dreams my дорогой](https://youtu.be/BDMmj5WgB8c); if it creeps you out any further, we have met, though I only said a couple words to you.

(n + x) there are others but i have to meet a guy in 55 minutes for a peculiar little drive....  kind regards all

edit: and of course, my special prince, how could I forget you...  but we'll still chat"

Legally health cards can be used as photo ID. For privacy reasons when they created health cards there was a rule that unless you're a medical expert you can't _ask_ someone for their health card. But they can still accept it if you offer it.

Ohh wow that’s a good chunk of people gone. Did you fail a year? Do you know if most people who actually start their degree in ece managed to finish it in ece (regardless of years delayed) or did they eventually transfer to something else? 
Thats like saying any prof can teach a 2nd or 3rd year Inorganic or physchem course which isn’t the case. Synthetic chemists don’t use analytical instrumentation (I do Inorganic chemistry so I know)  so how would they teach these courses.

"I had met 2 Chinese people in my life before coming to UW. Both girls, one was only half Chinese. Both went to UW too, C&amp;O and Nano Engineering. Before high school, where I met these two, there were zero Chinese kids in my school. There was only one (half) black kid and he was a violent idiot that no one liked. Everyone else was white.

One time I walked through Chinatown in Toronto.

I really can't comprehend how this is normal to other white people here. We are basically living in China."
"I'm not sure how applicable this is, but

You should be doing things because you want to, not because you feel like you have to. As in, you should do assignments because you want good marks, not feel like you have to do assignments to get good marks. You should eat and drink because you want to feel healthy/good, not because you feel like you need to eat and drink to live. 

They can still be considered achievements, though.

One could argue that they're the same, but it's a change in mindset."
"Kijiji/word of mouth/off campus housing site for the former

Mostly the facebook housing groups are where the sublets get posted.

Winter sublets are usually a bit cheaper than the lease price, and for spring they can be like 50% of the lease price if you wait long enough so that's why I think subletting is the better deal if you need it for these 2 terms. And there's always gunna be sublets avaliable in winter and spring, unlike in fall where it's a clusterfuck trying to find a place to live."
"Some people aren't good at consoling, especially in cases like this where the prof likely doesn't want to deal with. After the profs are all very busy people. I think it's fair to just follow the rules and leave the consoling to more qualified people.

Also, I've taken a course with Strickland and she is one of the most patient prof I've known. She's also quite accommodating in my experience, so I'm guessing OP's case has more to do with him being emotional rather than prof being unreasonable."
"mathsoc exam bank, TAs , profs for the practice problems. 

There's usually more than 1 way to do a problem and you can go thru what you've written to make sure there are no loopholes or you've ignored any edge cases or whatever.

To figure out the best way to do a proof just takes practice until you can recognize that certain kinds of problems require certains kinds of proofs - which comes thru doing loads of problems and having a prof or TA tell you if you're doing stuff the best way or not."
"Lost my keys + watcard once (on uw lanyard- which I think made it easy to identify that it was a student who lost it) and was returned the next day.

I called GRT and they said nothing came up, but will keep an eye out. Checked campus police, SLC turnkey, watcard office lost and found to see if anything turned up. Then got an email the next morning from watcard office saying they had my keys + watcard. Watcard lady told me that because there was a set of keys with my watcard + lanyard, it wasn't just going to be placed anywhere and that GRT will always give it to UW to deal with it.

"So unfortunately the IT budget is confidential and I don't know the breakdown. From my understanding the majority of the cost consists of salaries paid to IST employees who work on Feds services. Student fees only cover 80% of the IT budget (20% is covered by Commercial Operations) so it sounds like the total IT budget is ~ 346K.

At the last Council meeting, I moved [a recommendation to Board](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1lbLFdJruv0QZT6doKuCgnq0HPg64qg8g) to make the IT and Marketing budgets public. It appears that they only made the Marketing budget public for the next FY but I'm not sure of the reason why at the moment.

If you'd like more information, I'd suggest emailing the Chair of the Board of Directors at chair@feds.ca. "
"friendship is a lil different, I'm happy to make short-term friends and we can have fun, long-term wise tho we'd drift apart unless they also want to go Cali for full-time  
  
relationship is a completely different story, I think it's stupid to even start, being a #CaliOrBust fanatic and have unrestricted US work authorization should be a minimum requirement, you'll meet much more people that meet both of these in California than on UW campus  
  
fuck it forget California, it's like you want to move to Spain for full-time, would you start looking for SO that also intend to move to Spain for full-time **while at UWaterloo**? don't you think you'd have a much higher % of success after you move to Spain with a full-time job **while in Spain**?

"&gt;Being confident is def harder than it sounds. It's a gradual process of acknowledging the awesome parts about yourself and loving them. These things don't even need to be looks based. You can love that you're really good at what you're studying, or be really happy about how lucky you are to have a good friend group etc. Like IDK exactly how it works but it really shows outwardly when people start to do these things.

&gt;As long as you're clean and neat it's good enough.

Not true

&gt;Most dudes don't know anything about women's fashion so it's like w/e.

Most women don't either, you're sampling the bottom of the barrel. UWers are inelegant and plain looking. If OP has money and good tastes (regardless of trends) then she can stand out immensely in that respect.

There's a substantial difference between being an ugly chick with no style and one that shows refinement and taste. Honestly, I think that's the only way an unattractive girl would get a shot at scoring high (w/o being a pump&amp;dump). Plus the confidence she will get out of dressing with sophistication in a dump like Waterloo where people are too busy, poor, and neglected to make an attempt at it, will boost her confidence like crazy. I would go all in on that if I was OP. "
"Hey there, I was a coop at Curvegrid this summer and will be returning as a full time employee in January.

As /u/ddesrosier said, the interview process began with an online coding challenge (reasonably challenging, covered a couple areas of CS knowledge, not just algorithms) that was more so testing for effort rather than correctness. Then at the interview itself, there was another very basic coding test, so as to allow the interviewer to observe your thought process and your approach to problem solving. It is worth noting that at the  in person interview, the provided laptop has a Japanese keyboard layout which is a little tricky to pick up on the spot, so you may wish to bring your own machine.

Following the coding test at the interview, the rest of the interview focussed on your interest in the company and industry, as well as living in Japan. My overall impressions of the interview process was that they placed more emphasis on your willingness to learn, your ability to approach new problems, and your general outlook on life, rather than placing exclusive emphasis on your ability to regurgitate algorithms and programming knowledge on the spot.

As for working at the company itself, it was absolutely fantastic. I was treated as a full time employee and quickly ramped up to working on key features of the core product. The team was awesome, incredibly supportive, communicative, and collaborative. It was truly a pleasure working with them.

Aside from my interest in the work that we were doing, it was the atmosphere created by the attitudes of the team members that led to me to being very keen on returning as a fulltime employee following my graduation. The company's co-founders are excellent leaders, very knowledgeable and humble. They have a vision for where the company, and perhaps even society as a whole, is headed. I'm very excited to be able to be a part of this journey.

If there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to send me a DM. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. "

If you're lonely and miserable enough sometimes having any type of meaningful relationship feels better than not having any. (but like I said above I think this is a horrible decision that'll likely make the OP more miserable in the long run).

It still feels so bad to see this two courses dragging down my grade. I may have to sacrifice my time for other courses in order to pass these two. That's why i only gave an estimate of 80 for those four courses when setting up my bottom line.

"Friendly neighbourhood stats prof here! (As I'm sure you know from attending so many of my classes this term, yes I lurk on reddit.)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for raising concerns about the course, I'm interested in improving it in the longer-term, and it's always great to get feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to drop in to offer the following thoughts on this specific comment.

&amp;#x200B;

1. :(

&amp;#x200B;

2. While we spend a lot of time on 'stuff like PPDAC', I personally put a lot of effort into explaining \*why\* we do that. My lecture slides tend to be 'here's the minimum you need to pass/understand the material if you're good at self-study', my lectures tend to offer more context. Experimental design and analysis is \*extremely important\*, and I think in many ways much more important than the theory (unless you're going into higher level stats courses, in which case you should find the theory in STAT 231 pretty trivial).

&amp;#x200B;

It's not uncommon for us to receive feedback that STAT 231 spends too much time on non-theoretical material, and I understand the reasons. However, I would wager the majority of STAT 231 students will never calculate another maximum likelihood estimate, but they \*will\* encounter opportunities to apply the principles from some of the 'softer' chapters. I have worked with non-statisticians from a variety of scientific backgrounds, from researchers to doctors to google engineers. They all have questions they need stats to answer, and they (almost) all have an incredibly poor understanding of how to ask the right question, carefully design a study, and so on. If you want to get paid good money as a statistician, getting good at theory is the easy part. Learning to understand (and communicate) how to design a study so it actually does what you want it to is much, much, harder.

&amp;#x200B;

We also know from experience of teaching this course that students tend to struggle a \*lot\* on questions from the less theoretical material (such as PPDAC). This is a stats course, not a math course, and so we're gonna spend more time than you might expect on 'non-theoretical' material.

&amp;#x200B;

3. On the point of 'theory with no explanations'. I definitely agree that it'd be great if we could spend more time justifying some of the theoretical results we rely on. I try to explain as much of the theory as I have time for in class, but students in this course come from a variety of backgrounds and as such we have to make decisions about how best to apportion time/resources.

&amp;#x200B;

To spend more time on theory would require us to cut back elsewhere, and I should acknowledge that I, personally, would like to find ways to trim drown STAT 231 so we can accomplish that. (Note that these are only the views of one professor, and not of the department as a whole.) However, if it's perceived as a trade-off between theory and application, I would always prefer to have more of the latter. A rigorous understanding of the theory is only necessary if you intend to pursue higher-level statistics, at which point your needs should be met in our 300+ level courses. Indeed, I often highlight points where I encourage the more 'stats-inclined' students to review the underlying theory in their own time (and you're always welcome to come and see me in my office hours about this stuff!). For the rest of us, an understanding of the \*principles\* underlying the ideas is more than sufficient, and these are what I focus on.

&amp;#x200B;

4. What I take from the original post is that a number of students are prepared to sacrifice 20 minutes of sleep, but not 50 minutes of sleep, to sit near my face. I'm personally flattered to occupy such a middle-ground, and applaud what is clearly a quite carefully solved expectation-maximization problem."

"&gt;If the class is not memorization based, you should be doing practice problems instead of worrying about clean notes.

I understand how important practicing is (and I do consider reading ahead as a way to buy more time for this), but I have always felt confused if I so not review concepts before practicing. And when I look at my notes from class, they can be so crappy-looking at times (due to paying attention to class) that I believe rewriting them would save up a lot of time in the long run."

"I transferred after first year from another school into Waterloo so I know a bit of the process. If you finish your semester/year here then admissions will mainly look at your first year marks because they are a better indicator than high school marks of how you will do in their university. So I would recommend withdrawing from this term if you're absolutely sure you want to leave. Then admissions will only look at your high school marks. You might have to explain why you withdrew on your application, but that shouldn't be too bad. Definitely go see an academic advisor here, and also get in touch with the academic advisors or transfer student advisors at the universities you are thinking of applying to. You will have to apply through OUAC again. "

"Nice try, but a party whip exists for a reason, and looking into candidates is a far simpler matter than you seem to make it sound.

If we are talking MPs, the easiest way to go about it is to look at their voting history, as its public, and compare it to their party's voting on those issues. This was one tactic employed in the anti Harper movement, as some ridings had CPC candidates who were willing to challenge the party's more controversial decisions (actually, ""if elected, will you stand up to Stephan Harper on x"" was a common question).

Usually parties vote as blocks, so thoroughly investigating the party and your home riding is sufficient.

I don't think people who were too young to witness the Harper era themselves really appreciate how much of a problem he was, outside of the strong economy he helped build. There were definitely good things he did, but it is far overshadowed by the anti intellectual policies, and other controversial decisions.

While Trudeau has done some things I 200% disagree with, he hasn't embraced anti intellectualism. He also isn't the past few Liberal leaders that came before him.

If you want to be critical of my views on the CPC, a good place to start is getting up to date on the past 20 years of politics generally speaking, and the past five years more thoroughly. Pay careful attention to a party's values (I do quite like what I saw last time I checked the CPC values, but their platform did not reflect those values), their platforms, and where your riding's candidates fall with respect to their parties.

Scheer is shaping up to be Harper: The Next Generation.

I don't agree with everything Bernier's doing, but I look forward to seeing where he takes his party and what the PPC candidate for my riding will look like."

"I'm not siding with ""guys"" or ""girls"", I just don't like generalizations and I think calling them out is fine. 

Also if it was just one girl saying this I wouldn't think it was a problem, but I've seen a bunch of people say similar things over the last few months and they usually get a bunch of upvotes too.

Sure you can make remarks to whoever you want, but so can I, that's the great thing about reddit, and other public discussion forums. That's what encourages discussion.

I kinda feel like you think I'm attacking you personally or something. I'm not, I'm sure you're a good person. I just think generalizations can be dangerous and at the very least can make people uncomfortable. And again all I feel like Deputy_Dan is doing here is calling that out, that doesn't mean I'm siding with guys over girls. I dislike it when guys do this to girls too. I don't think it's so horrible that I need to call it out myself everytime, but I don't think there's anything wrong with Dan's comment.

While you have a meal plan, anything from your watcard spent on food get a 50% discount.

The second one would cost 1 dollar from your flex dollar, and since each flex dollar is one real dollar, you would save the dollar on your second drink."
"Civil with a bunch of building science co-ops here, I think I would best be able to give an opinion for architectural engineering.

My two cents is that from the courses offered it seems quite similar to civil with more flexibility in the technical electives to study building enclosure systems and more traditionally architectural science related courses. The vast majority seems identical to civil with the exception of studio courses.

In terms of career prospect, I believe that if you can kick off a career in building consulting it would be quite stable and pays decently in the long run. People seem to switch to building remediation from structural when the market slows down; there will always be stuff to fix, but not necessarily new construction. "
"I can see that you are trying to discover why S said racist word -- that is, very likely because the girl and her friends were reserving seat.

IMO, reserving seats is very common in Uni, especially in CS classes. (If you don't believe you can go to a high-rating teacher's CS115 class). People were outside the door waiting for seats 15 min before class.

The girl and her friends were already in seat, and wanted to reserve more seats. I don't think there is any problem reserving seats unless someone was already in the seat. If no one is there, reserving seats is acceptable and appropriate. Plus, they aren't reserving the row. If you count the total number of people, they have at most 6 people, while 3 of them are already in seat. So by your rule it is also appropriate and acceptable.

In conclusion, the girl is totally innocent. And please stop your unmeaningful arguments. They're just pointless. Please leave the girl alone. She is the victim. Right now we should all be focusing on the racist person."

"That's an interesting observation.

"I saw Donna Strickland at a grocery store in Kitchener yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything.

She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

"I would probably keep the class. You won't be able to add a new class (and so you'll behind a class, and need to pay for a new one and make up the extra course likely during a summer or co-op term), and the dropped class will appear on your transcript. Dependent on how bad 'really bad' is, you might be able to salvage an okay mark. First year is arguably when your grades will be the worst, so if your other marks are fine, your overall term average will be okay and there won't be any lasting effects."
"You clearly haven't listened to a word I've said. My point is that people make mistakes when grading and questioning them is not wrong if you can justify your answer. Sure a lot of lazy people go in trying to beg for grades, and its ridiculous. But sometimes hard working people get grades that don't seem reasonable and I think they should go challenge them. I've personally worked extremely hard for my 3.9 gpa. I dont think Im entitled if I ask to review something that I think was marked incorrectly."

If you're really stuck and you just need something so you can actually submit your application you can tell the profs something like ""At this point I really just need a letter, even if it's super generic.

"I am also talking about the same thing. Stronger more potent weed will obviously have more an affect on your mental capability. 

Most of the high functional stoners that at least I’ve encountered have been those who make “smoke” but on average over a period of a week or month consume far less thc

Think of it this way. Is one or two beers every so often bad for you? No. But get shitfaced every other day and you’ll see your mental capability deteriorate. Same applies if u smoke a joint vs if you’re taking fat bong rips. 

Also for the second point. People may not smoke the same strain but they smoke the same grade. Most people do not smoke better weed then drop down to B or C grade weed. Higher grade weed often has a higher thc/gram ratio. "

"Sorry I was AFK for a while! 

I completely understand. I get migraines too, and this shit smells disgusting to me (though it's not nearly as much of a trigger for me). Either way, tobacco products have far more addictive potential (from a medical perspective) than cannabis products.

I think a lot of our impression as a society about why this is a ""bad drug"" and what not stems from the fact that it was criminalized on primarily racial/ethnic grounds early in the war on drugs. I don't think it's a reflection on the safety of or risk associated with cannabis. So when I say ""can we not continue to criminalize cannabis and treat it as worse when it's not"" I was referring to addictive potential, generally (though not exhaustively) lower second hand health effects, and what not.

I hate the smell of it ... and I also hate the smell of tobacco smoke. Ideally, I would be pro-High-School ""ban all smoking on campus"" policies, but I think generally if you're going to be writing a policy it should be done right."

Can't stress this enough. Punishing yourself rarely makes these problems better. Give yourself a break. You are unmotivated because all you've done is beat yourself up. Eventually your mind is gonna want to avoid the thing that causes the beatings.

I guess psychologically speaking people like talking to attractive people so in interviews or when they are talking to prospective candidates they are more likely to have a higher success rate if people find them pretty. It sucks and it isn't fair, but it's true."

"&gt; Do things get better? 

Do people really believe that university magically gets easier after 1A? No, it gets progressively more difficult conceptually speaking and peaks in 3rd year usually.

To address your issue, it sounds to me like you simply don't understand the content you are being presented. Before throwing in the towel and just saying you are just too stupid, try to see if there is another reason.

Why do you think this is the case? Does the lecture teaching style not fit your learning style? Do you have difficulties digesting what a textbook is trying to convey? Maybe you'd learn better from doing practice problems but that's not the way university is set up, so you would have to get your own tutor or look online for resources for that."
"NYC has a lot to do and is very convenient (subways, food) but it really depends on what you like. I have friends that love going out so they love the city, I personally don't like doing anything on weekdays so I don't find NYC any better than Toronto. I've only been to SF once for a weekend but I liked it a lot more, mainly because I prefer moderate weather and I liked that it wasn't as crowded. 

Housing wise, you can find a room in a 2-4 bedroom apartment for ~$1500 or less in most neighbourhoods. Most apartments are small walk-ups with no laundry tho, and units are pretty small. You'll have to pay more if you want more amenities or to live alone. Check out Craigslist sublets &amp; temps and rooms &amp; shares to get an idea of the apartments here "
"Yes, cutting oweek. Having a full week break instead of the current means that you get a few extra days to catch up on your readings and other related work. 

An underappreciated advantage of the full break is the potential for it to reduce stress and anxiety levels, especially among first years as they are still trying to adapt to university life, but this applies to all students, as many of us (myself included) struggle a bit with getting back into the ryhthm of university instead of full time work.

It's wholly disingenuous to act like this isn't a net benefit. Orientation only benefits froshies, and only certain faculties even take advantage of orientation. I can guaran-fucking-tee that most students, in hindsight, will prefer a full reading week."
"&gt; Nice job editing your comments to make me look bad

Nothing in my edit was really changing my point, I just had more to add.

&gt; you're absolutely nuts

Sure thing. Yet you're replying to someone you think is ""nuts"".

&gt; And you just said you don’t care about helping/changing them so why are you shaming them?

Publically shaming those who have made the mistake prevents others from making the same mistake. What I meant by that is that I don't bother to talk to them 1 on 1 because that accomplishes nothing (see this conversation as an example).

&gt; Not sure who screams about that other than feminists and pick up artists.

Kind of sad how narrow your mind is, then. I am neither of those things and yet here I am saying it. Besides, you just called me a ""sexist mormon"", now I'm a pick up artist? Make up your mind. Just because I know the psychology pick up artists manipulate women with, it doesn't mean I use it. It just means I'm smart enough to understand it, which is a pretty fucking low bar."
"Once the LRT is up and running, GRT is making adjustments to the bus network to connect better to stations and move people around in a faster, ""straighter"", and hopefully more reliable way. (""straighter"" because there are few truly straight roads in this region)

So, Route 9 will be split. The new Route 9 will be that part of the old Route 9 that runs from Conestoga Mall to Albert McCormick Arena and then it will turn down Parkside to connect with the R&amp;T Park ION Station, down through the park, and into the University of Waterloo ION Station (a bus platform is supposed to be built between Ring Road and Phillip where the current service road is). I *assume* that this will mean you'll see a stop at Parkside and Bearinger as it will be a local bus. 

The part of the old Route 9 that runs down Albert/Hazel/University will become Route 19 and start from the Northfield ION Station.

"&gt;  moved out when I was barely 14 and I feel like they missed out on most of my formative years.

huh? boarding school? I moved out at 18 and I thought that was early by today's standards LOL..

&gt; I mean, I'm in CS, I'm international, I'm 100% East Asian, I agree with you 100%, and I don't think that's racist in the slightest. Truth is, this is not normal. I've been to several universities in Europe, and their CS schools are pretty much all native/domestic students.

Math is worse than CS, but yea.. it's abnormal. And I've had to adjust my life significantly, sometimes at monetary and other cost, to feel like I actually have a social life. That's nice to hear about Europe, but I can't afford to go to school there. There are top Universities in my home country, I should be able to attend them, but I just can't stomach the isolation and feeling like I'm living in a foreign country anymore.

&gt; The fact that the STAT 443 cheaters only got partial marks docked off their projects speaks volumes to this. 

I don't know what ended up happening there. I stopped following it, even though I'm probably the one person that should know what happened....

&gt; I've personally seen how rampant plagiarism and cheating are among international students (many of my international friends do on a daily basis).

I never saw it before, because I never really associated with them. I just assumed the class average was high because we were recruiting the top students from these massive countries. I don't even know how I emerged with the marks I did now that I know how common the cheating is.. probably because the grades were like 90% exam based, which I absolutely *hated* ... but I know exactly why they do it now. 

&gt; Which is one of the reasons why I will be leaving this country immediately after graduation. Living here isn't fun.

Right, and that's easy for you to do. Imagine how that feels for me... Like I don't want to just complain but it's kind of absurd. My family arrived in this country before it was even ""Canada"", and now I live as a foreigner.

I'm not leaving Canada immediately anyway. I'm just applying for jobs in Toronto and I plan to live in the most Scottish and luckily also the richest area of the GTA where my in-laws live... 

&gt; Fair point. I see UW as a trade school and a trade school only. It opens a lot of doors for me career wise but that's it.

Well what's unfortunate is that I came here under the impression that I would get some sort of timeless education in mathematics. I wanted to be a professor. But I realized that would mean dealing with depressed Gen Z kids for the next 20 years, while being completely impotent to do anything about the massive amounts of cheating I'd be witnessing. I just can't do it, I have far too strong of a moral character.

&gt; I hate to be that guy, but I absolutely despise it when people think all Asian people are the same and share the same social and cultural values.

Sorry, I don't. I should really just say ""Chinese"". I've learned a lot about different Asian cultures; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian (Sikhs, Hindus) etc. I've read their old works, religious texts, histories etc. I was just trying to be brief.

&gt; I actually have a hard time trying to fit into the East Asian community here, precisely because my values are so different from the prevailing values the majority of the international students (mostly rich Chinese kids whose parents think Canada is the bastion of rationality, kindness, and beyond) have here.

Canada is the bastion of kindness for sure. So kind to the point of being detrimental... Not sure how the hell we're rational when our PM is a substitute drama teacher but whatever.

&gt; Good for you, I have to say. It will be worth it. The best decision I've made over my years at UW is that I decided to forgo fat paycheques down south and move to Europe for a co-op. It was an eye-opening journey of self-discovery.

Sound strategy. Silicon Valley doesn't seem like a place to be for anything but getting fat paycheques and being babysat as an """"adult"""".

"DO NOT DROP OUT. Email your prof asap explaining the issue and use campus resources to seek help.

The prof has a few options that you could ask about:

1. Retake the exam. Prof needs to proctor or delegate one for you. Easiest solution but prof may worry about cheating.

2. Retake a new/modified exam. Prof needs to write and proctor/delegate. Easiest solution for you, but prof needs to put in the extra work.

3. Prof shifts weight of your midterm to the final. Easy for prof but they might not want to do this. Also makes your final more stressful.

4. Prof gives you a zero or an arbitrary grade, but waives the requirement that you pass/attend the midterm to pass the course. You have to make up the grade the hard way (e.g. May need a 75 on final to pass).

5. Prof gives you a zero and fails you. If this is the case, that sucks but it's not the end of the world and campus resources like your academic advisor or counseling services may be able to push back for you.

It's still *very likely that you can pass the course*, and even if you don't it is not the end of your academic career.

"Sorry to hear you're going through some rough stuff :( Unfortunately the referrals process usually requires you to see a physician in person, so that they can professionally assess you and your health situation. I think this is partly done to minimize the costs on both 1) patients and 2) the health care system, when you do eventually get referred to a psychiatrist, because if referrals could take place over the phone, we'd probably see even longer wait times at psychiatrists' offices, which wouldn't help you as a patient. I totally agree that the long wait time to see a psychiatrist is unfortunate...is there any way you could look into a privately funded psychiatrist or counsellor? I'm not sure what your financial situation is, but I believe some privately funded clinics have shorter wait times. Some other advice, for what it's worth...while you're waiting to get prescribed medication, try taking advantage of some of the other on-campus services like MATES (peer counselling), and clubs that might allow you to meet and share experiences with new people. Good luck! It sounds like you're having a really hard time, both personally and as you try to navigate the system, but I wish you only good things.

"I find the code is really easy, and then it takes literally forever to set up all the scripts and stuff for the absurd amount of experiments and testing we are supposed to be doing. They reduced the number of experiments we had to do on the last assignment by like 75% a few days after releasing it, and it was still a tonne of work.

Not really a fan of it, I learn nothing from all of the tests I am running, except getting better at writing garbage bash scripts. I get what they are trying to do, since all of the questions involving testing are getting us to learn something about the efficiency of the algorithms we are creating, but when it takes several times longer than the actual coding part, I don't think it makes so much sense, its just super tedious."
"biggest factor depends on your CS 136 grade (mid 80s is competitive, high 80s+ to be safe) or your program's equivalent if it exists; you can have 90+ average in all your other courses but if you have &lt;= mid 70s in CS 136 you're probably getting rejected

idk anything about tron courses but I saw a comment on here saying ECE 250 is the equivalent of CS 136 so whatever tron's DS&amp;A course y'all take would probs be the equivalent

EDIT: My knowledge on the ""equivalent"" to CS 136 is just based off of another comment (most people just take CS 136 and other math faculty math courses to transfer from another faculty iirc) and idk if the same grade requirement is true for the ""equivalent"" course if it even is true; my numbers for CS 136 is accurate though"
"&gt;Comparing Faith Goldy (for example) to flat earth theory and anti-vaxxers is ridiculous. 

Not at all, her views are equally as ridiculous. Someone reciting the 14 words loses any potential credibility. The only thing she would (potentially) be qualified to speak on is journalism.

&gt;And yet we have CNN and FOX spewing absolute nonsense 24/7.

Uh, private non-Canadian companies?

&gt;If you don't think it's a human right to have freedom of speech, in an absolute sense, not just the government restricting it, then we have nothing to discuss here.

Free speech yes, not a right to be heard or given a stage on which to say said speech. Goldy (as an example) would certainly be free to rent a location herself if she is wanting to give a lecture.

&gt;Your rhetoric sounds almost identical to all of the SJWs who were posting on LSPIRG and other pages during the Shepherd and Goldy fiascos so I really doubt there is any point to this conversation.

Then why on earth did you try and continue such a discussion?"

I disagree. Nobody making meaningful and lasting impact is spending this much time on reddit and has this many accounts.

Imagine thinking you can make an impact alone/as an employee/part of a giant coorporation. Creating startups is way  more meaningful  than working at a corporation because you're making direct impact.

"Absolutely I do. I don't like to partake much myself - not my cup of tea. But I have seen the wonders that marijuana can do for people. People with chronic pain, people with depression, people with anxiety, people with eating disorders/appetite problems, people with insomnia... the list goes on. Many of these people will not go to the lengths to get a medical license - it might be cheaper and easier for them to just use pot the way they're used to. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's less dangerous than both cigarettes and alcohol - sure the smoke is bad for your lungs but its much less carcinogenic than cig smoke. And when they do edibles the risk is even less. Nobody has ever, and I mean ever (feel free to challenge me on this) overdosed from weed. Yes you can ""green out"" but no one has died or suffered brain damage. The only true long term side effects can be to memory and focus, and that is if you use it very often. Much less side effects than cigs and alcohol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, even if you did see weed as a problematic drug, legalization has been proven over and over to HELP lessen drug problems. People are safer that way, they have access to regulated drugs and so there's less chance for something to be laced. And it's easier to get people off the streets and into rehab programs when they don't face the stigma of criminalization. Besides, it'll make a bunch of money for the government instead of dealers. Money that can go into social services for people who have drug and mental health problems.

"To clarify, at the student level, and over the short term, any financial advise would likely preclude anything to do with investing.  So what this really boils down to is budgeting.  

Budgeting is an iterative process.  You initially set your targets, see how it meets reality, then tweak as necessary.  So you review your earnings and decide how much is spent on debt repayment vs. your Phil's fund.  Try your targetting out for a month, revise as necessary, maybe you want more going to Phil's, and less for debt repayment.  In the end, budgetting is about having the information to control where your funds go.

There's certainly enough general information on budgetting online that you can DIY.  However most of it's general non-student stuff (not that that makes a huge difference).  The closest thing that I know of that's targetted at students would be this:

[https://myuniversitymoney.com/more-money-for-beer-and-textbooks-launch/](https://myuniversitymoney.com/more-money-for-beer-and-textbooks-launch/)

In terms of someone in person, I'm not familiar with anything, and suspect there'll be little available.  Selling financial advise to students seems like a tough business model - most aren't interested, and of those, most aren't interested in paying enough to make this worthwhile for anyone able to do the job properly.

One example of the costs of this would be [www.moneycoachescanada.com](https://www.moneycoachescanada.com) \- they'd charge $200-$300/month I believe, and likely subject to a one year agreement."

"Came into effect yesterday, sure as is noted on this policy draft, but the website wasn't updated as of 1 hour before I made the initial post and this is a leaked draft from committee.

"I'm taking CS245 now. Honestly the content isn't too hard but syntax and writing up your argument is the more difficult part (at least so far - I heard post midterm content is harder) and I found in-class examples really help to clarify what your arguments should look like. So far I think it's similar to MATH 135 with more rules you need to follow and easier assignments.

"Dear jasfiraz_n,

We regret that we are not able to offer you admission to the Bachelors of Computer Science program. As you probably know, we look at each application a whole. Admissions decisions are based on a composite of information including your previous academic performance, comments on the subreddit, autism levels, and number of chromosomes.

Your application file was considered in detail by me and by the faculty members in your area of interest. The number of applications we received far exceeded the number of students we are able to accept, and so we had to make very difficult admissions decisions. Each application is considered in relation to other applications in the same area and only the very top applicants are admitted. Your application, considered as a whole, was not as strong as some of the others we received.

Although I must regretfully send you an unfavorable response to your application, I appreciate your interest in our program and I certainly wish you the best for your future work.

"It depends. 

I've had a dog since I was in 2B (not just a family dog, but my own dog that I look after 100% on my own) and I'm now in grad school. For me it's very worth it. I love dogs and having one gives me structure and organization and helps me keep on track of things. There have been times when having a dog is hard in school. During final seasons it's often very difficult to find the balance and sometimes I'm away for 12 hour days for grad school related things.

If you are thinking of getting a dog while in school, please keep in mind it's a huge commitment. It's not like a hamster or fish (or even cat to some degree) that you can just leave extra food out and go away for the weekend with friends. It's a 100% time commitment. So if you're thinking that you might want to travel/go abroad/go away for a lot of weekend, make sure you really take this into account before getting a pet (even the ones that aren't as demanding as the doge). 

Another important thing to consider is cost. Are you prepared if you have to pay an unexpected vet bill? Are you prepared to be buying the needed pet supplies? 

It can be very rewarding being a pet owner and it's nice not coming home and being alone, but it is also a long-term commitment and a lot of responsibility . "
"You should just write them a note (or talk to them in person- I would say in person would be better) and just say say hey guys, I don't care what goes on in your own personal life but I really don't like the smell of smoke in my apt. Would you be able to smoke not near the vents/cover them up when you're smoking and/or crack a window? 

You said it's coming from the air system so if they cover up the vents in their apt while they smoke and open a window then it shouldn't be pungently redirected into your apt. They won't really be able to open a window during the winter but it's warm enough now. You might even want to tell a white lie and say you have really sensitive allergies to dust etc and smoke sets them off. 

Most ppl smoking weed are pretty chill and will probably go along with being more corteous when it comes from a real person being bothered and not just some notes from management. I feel like humans in general are more apt to think about what they're doing when they know of the direct harm to a tangible person as opposed to a nebulous management group sending a note. Some ppl won't be considerate bc there's always jerks in this world but you should at least try. It wouldn't be that hard for them to cover up the vent for like 30 mins or whatever. "
"&gt; Fallacy of relative privation. Those other bigger problems in the world, which are supposedly bigger than the integrity of the fucking planet

Completely missed the point of my argument. Canada has barely any effect on climate change, other than our nice big forests. So it's just virtue signaling. Nothing is actually changing.

So there are bigger problems *in Canada*, which Trudeau is often causing or making worse by following in his father's footsteps.

I could list hundreds of reasons why I think this country is going to shit thanks to Trudeau, Wynne and various other leftist morons.

Lol. Empathy isn't going to fix anything. And the way you've worded this sounds like it's imperative; I agree it is useless to argue with someone who blindly has faith in authority.

"The Feds AGM is on October 24th at noon in SLC's Great Hall (free food is usually provided).

GM's are required by the [Ontario Corporations Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c38) and while your power there is a bit more diffuse than on Council (there's a ton of students, Feds is a large organization), few people show up. **Do you want ~200 people deciding stuff for 32000 students, including you?**

If you want to submit an agenda item, tonight is the last night you can. Member motions/items cannot be rejected for consideration unless they change the bylaws (in which case Board has a legal obligation to consider them) or were already debated within 1 year (repeat motions aren't permitted because it's usually just to force through an item you want over and over again).

No, not all speech warrants a soap box. It isn't intellectual suicide to not permit a lecture on flat earth theory, or that vaccines cause autism.

"A few tips:

1. Don’t expect things to come to you. By being in CS you’re at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to the dating game so you have to try harder to make and keep connections. This means sometimes taking risks and reaching out to people you otherwise wouldn’t.

2. Don’t let “being in CS” be your defining trait. There ain’t enough fish in the sea for you to go on and on about whatever assignment you’re stressing over or what side projects you’ve been doing . Get some hobbies or at least get into a show and talk about that.

3. If this wasn’t already implied, clean yourself up. You may not be the best looking, but you’ll definitely be passable if you shower, wear deodorant, wear nice-ish clothes and keep your hair groomed."

I'm actually taken aback by this thread. I understand some may not know it's a common courtesy to send get well or thank you emails, but this prof is trying to teach that. Sure, it wasn't done with delicacy as she thought everyone should have, but most wouldn't send this email. They would just judge you and hold it against you without your knowledge. 99% of people in this thread are getting defensive about it. Learn from it. Be courteous. It goes a long way."
"It’s dangerous to go into anything with the attitude of “I understand the material just fine, it’s the question that’s dumb”.

"Never give up. I suffered from chronic headaches and saw soooo many doctors.  They just told my mom I was looking for attention and/or was simply going through a stressful time in life.  One even said I had a headache at Wonderland because I was overwhelmed by the activity �� 

One day I went to a clinic for a bad cut  and the doctor realized I had really blocked sinus' and gave me meds to clear it up and for the first time in 4 years I was headache free. A simple 20 minute random appointment was all it took compared to the hours I spent at other doctors who gave me zero help.

Be persistent.  Keep track of when your symptoms occur/what your doing/stress level/weather  etc.. super time consuming but worth it 

Good luck :) I hope you feel better soon! "

"oh the memories.

I am an alum from the 80's.  Back then we used to have to write an exam called the ""English Language Proficiency Exam"" in frosh week.  Imagine in your first week of university walking into a gym set up like that?  It gave you the willies immediately.

And the way the ELP's were done did not help.  You sat down and on the desk was one of those old school lined writing books, and a piece of paper that simply said something like ""Turn over when instructed and write about the topic on the other side"".  And a gym full of students crapping their pants.

The topics were real doozers and there were no instructions, just the topic.  3 hrs.

My topic was ""Me and the boys and our beer"".  My roommate's topic: ""She asked for it the rapist said"".

Can you image being a frosh weenie and on day 3 of arriving on campus getting something like that?  If you passed you did not have to take English courses and if you failed I think you had to take 2 courses between 1st and 2nd yr.  I passed. In retrospect a nice english course full of pretty arts major would actually have been a good thing.

At that time the general feeling was the ELPs were a sop to the arts faculty admin on the assumption anyone in a STEM (we did not call it that then but you know what I mean) was incapable of being functionally literate, although of course its always been that the students with the lowest marks at UW are in the arts faculty (or Rec).

I hear there are no more ELP's.

Anyways seeing this picture that is my immediate flashback."

Jeremy/Rachel teaches ML/AI from a Top-Down approach, and pre-reqs are pretty low."
"I don't think so. I thought so before too, but my friends say that it's really not creepy unless you do it in a creepy way. How far you can go kinda depends how attractive you are tbh, but the cold call isn't considered to be stalker behavior in general. "
"Im first year (arts) and thought the orientation was really lame, and pretty much everyone I talked to in my classes thought the same.

I paid the money, went to the first day then left halfway through and didn't come back.

For me it already was shorter."
Im going to the fucking dean I dont care how long it takes to get this resolved or how much time it takes off my academic time that I could spend learning something which definitely hasn't happened in the class where all he does is ramble about bullshit. 
"It didn't help you become better in anyway?

Didn't make you become and feel stronger, improve your cardio, or anything at all? If you weren't doing cardio, I recommend doing that.

Did you also never feel any sense of accomplishment when you excersised? "
"Must be upper class Anglos then, most people really don't like this kind of behavior.

As in, it's fine to say what your dad does and that he's successful, but bragging about exactly how much money you have in your bank account is definitely frowned upon."
Start establishing those good studying habits right now and try to catch up as much as you can. Studying 12 hours a day will only lead to burnout and will not help you retain a lot of information. It is much easier to do just bursts of studying each day. 
"Thanks! I'm assuming all hikes will be less crowded these days compared to the summer probably. We were just looking at Rattlesnake point as well.

Have you done the Nokomis trail? Just came by that and holy it looks breathtakkng but it's too far away :(("
"Welcome to Canada's shitty healthcare system.  2 months is actually already considered fast cause our school has their own psychiatrists. If you went out to a local physician and asked for a psychiatrist you'd be waiting 6 months lmao

Best of luck friend"
"Were they really that effective? I have pretty bad focus issues, waz considering trying to get diagnosed for ADHD, but wasn't sure if it was worth it and don't really wanna depend on drugs. But if they're that effective then maybe I should give it a shot."
"What do you want?

Sex is generally seen differently by guys and girls.

You always hear ""You do you. You don't owe him anything...etc""

But you have to realize that ""They do them. They don't owe you anything.""

Sounds like an actual double standard to me"
"Yeah, so what I’m trying to say is, if u get an offer outside of ww, flop ur ww interviews and make it look like u looked outside of ww cus u couldn’t get anything in ww. If u don’t get an offer outside of ww, then try ur best on ur ww interviews.  "

 CIVIL ENG

Hi,

I'm a second year engineering student looking for a internship in the summer. I have heard differing opinions on the format of my resume. I would appreciate some feedback. plz ty"
"don't neglect interviewing and the time needed for job hunting, esp for full-time  
  
if a company wants to fly you onsite, you gotta squeeze out time to hop on the flight and skip classes  
  
take bird classes, the ones that you can skip and still pass"
"CS135 - hand-write your assignments without aids

MATH137 - know your definitions, be able to do proofs by grinding proof questions (the computations are easy)

&amp;#x200B;

MATH135 - grind the assignments, look at past examples, do totally new proof questions and be able to explain your thought process every step of the way

&amp;#x200B;

For all of these, do the practice midterm or exam. In no way are they totally representative of the exam, but is good practice for you to simulate the exam environment."
"Can I just say fuck that TA who told you that, no one should be telling a student they are hopeless. When it comes time for reviews I hope you write something down. 

Besides that though, a key thing you said is that everyone around you seems to be doing fine and the keyword is seems. No one will come right out and say they are struggling. You are doing the right thing though from the sounds of it. I would maybe suggest trying to take some time to get into a better head space and keep on asking questions. "
"Co-op work experience doesn't count as valid work experience for permanent residence applications. 

After graduation you can probably get a 3 year post graduation work-permit and can apply for permanent residence through the Canadian Experience Class a year after working on your work permit.

You can read more about these on cic.gc.ca and the Student Success Office is also having an information session on paths to permanent residency some time in November. You can find the date if you check their website."
"Couldn't they set up virtual stations where the scooters can be parked, and when you first take the scooter you're charged an extra dollar which you get back if you leave it in a designated location. Ideally, people would be responsible without incentive but if there's problems with clutter perhaps that could be a fix.

I suppose one limitation of the success would be the reliability of the built-in GPS trackers and figuring out how to be reasonable with the drop-off locations in a cost-effective manner..."
"I haven't deleted a single of my comments. You're talking about the rating shit? It's true. Most chicks are ugly (and guys too frankly), deal with it... or that I told a self-described ugly girl to aim for guys as attractive as she is? shocker, it's not cute getting hit on by an ugly chick. It's bothersome and awkward and a waste of everyone's time.

&gt;You seem very hateful.

You're the one dug in jealousy over the simplest things of life.

Don't change you're brave and beautiful and it's totally healthy"
"The errors should give you a very good indication of what is wrong, so at least getting it to compile shouldn't be very hard, but if you have trouble even getting stuff like a cond statement or a list abbreviation to work that's a problem.

Right now this assignment is on recursion, if you have trouble with that make sure you talk to peers/go to tutorial to have a strong understand of how that works, otherwise you won't be able to do the assignment well.

And the time taken for each assignment really varies depending on how much effort you make. Just compare your marks to the class average, should help you understand where you're at.

And again, it's more important to have perseverance in university than talent or natural ability, so don't give up just yet."
"I am actually a 2A student who has taken cs 135 before and end up with a 95. Not to discriminate or anything, but from my understanding, a lot of international students usually have taken similar courses before in their high school(which covers almost the whole cs 135), so the average is not really a good indicator. I also have friends in cs 115 before, I will say the course covers very similar material, the only difference is how in depth it goes and how hard the assignment is. If I were you, I am just gonna keep going with the course and find as much extra help as i can to pass (i know it is irritating especially you have to put more time in something you dislike). However since you have to do either cs 116 or cs 136 anyway in next term, doing cs 135 will make you find cs 116 a lot easier and get a better score. On the other hand, if you are planning to do grad school or anything, a Withdrawl does not look gd.
(Anyway i hope my advice will help you in some way, and gd luck with any decision you are making)"
"I guess I should start off by saying that this answer will be different based on every recruiter and company you talk to so I can only speak to my personal preferences. Since I have been through co-op and understand the rating system I do put some weight on the reviews. 

Usually the more experience you have the better chance you have. For our Eng roles when you have solid applications from people who have worked for Google or LinkedIn or Snap it's usually a pretty safe bet to at least give them an interview. Extra circulars are important but I don't really care what. Just want to see that you are involved in your community or other passions outside of school. A lot of times it can just come down to what the hiring managers want too. Right now they are really interested in people with Javascript, Ruby and React experience so those applications will be favoured in the selection. Marks aren't a big thing but if most marks are below 70's and 80's then I would need strong work experience and performance reviews."
