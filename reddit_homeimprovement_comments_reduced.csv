"&gt; You are pouring the slc on to the subflooring correct? Not directly on the subfloor, no.  There's the subfloor, then an extra piece of 3/4"" plywood, then an extra layer of flooring in just the kitchen that has asbestos so we don't want to remove it."
"Agree. Cleaning out the fence line will do a lot. Paint the wood fence white, and get some gravel on your driveway.Edit: cut the post on the left to match the short one on the right. There was probably a gate there at one point but now it just looks odd."
"All you have to do is get one leg on a step and you can offset the ends but leave the planks level.&amp;#x200B;I have used an extension ladder, setting both feet on one step and placing the top against the top of the wall at the bottom of the stairs.  "
"Any time I try to match old ceiling tiles I can never find them and end up replacing the whole ceiling.  A 2x2 pattern is much more modern and clean as well.  Feel like they purposely change the pattern just enough to mess with your head and your wallet."
"Check out the read/write stats on a  M.2 PCI SSD - Samsung makes a good product. I have one in my desktop. When I got mine, I was shocked how small it was - not much bigger than a USB stick. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BYHGNB5/ref=emc_b_5_t)"
"Consider good landscaping, too. If you have it so that water flows away from the foundations to places where it can soak in, and use a hard landscape that won't erode when it does rain, then you may be doing what you need for your foundation.&amp;#x200B;"
"Cork Is a great product but mold will definitely grow on cork, it won't necessarily grow ""in"" the cork, but will definitely grow ""on"" the cork if the moisture conditions are right. But I definitely like cork and use it. I've seen mold grow on metal studs. "
"Did they call you to ask where is an outlet they can use? Did you forget that you do not have an outlet for them to use? They couldü__ve called you and you couldü__ve left the door open for them to use the outlet thatü__s available. It works both ways. "
"Every time that happens to me itü__s because Iü__ve bumped into or knocked out of alignment one of the sensors. Leg, grill, bike, etc. Give them a wiggle and see if any of the lights change, then give it another try. Cheapest way to start, if nothing else."
"From the photo that looks like the ü__media cabinetü_ù. Those are coax cables. Likely a ü__home runü_ù that the cable company can activate, and then runs to the rooms where you may want a tv ü__ kitchen, bedroom, etc.  those can be Joined with a splitter. "
"From the title, I was expecting something like a [one-way (two-way?)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_mirror) mirror with an automated blackout curtain behind it or something, so that you could use it as both a window or a mirror.Nice work, though!"
Go to a board meeting and talk about it. You might be able to convince them site visibility is fine and move on. Or not. If not what are they going to do about it?  Probably fine you. How much how often?  Might be worth the ransom. Probably not but maybe. 
"Good luck!  Enjoy your pool and put the money into a good fence to keep the neighborhood kids and dogs out.  I've often dreamed of having a portable, modular ""deck"" that can be put over the top of the pool for more outdoor space when you're not swimming.  "
"Grout and tiles are porous, there will be a membrane behind the tile to prevent water leaching into the framing.Any moisture damage should be visible on areas outside the shower or adjacent rooms, look for swelling baseboards, damn carpet or spongy walls"
"He said he couldnü__t give me an estimate on hours when I asked. However, with how particular heü__s been on everything (heü__s had 4 visits, each 1-2.5 hours in length), Iü__d definitely say heü__ll exceed 16 hours. Thatü__s good information - thank you. "
"How convenient!  Since the Romex is already strung along the fence, you can just wire some bulb sockets directly into it--instant ambience!  I love that the autoplayed video after it was TOH-how to run underground power to a shed.  Youtube knows what's up."
How deep did you set your screws? If the sheets aren't properly secured they will move and cause cracking. Drywall can withstand a fair amount if movement without cracking if screws are put in right. The materials that you used to tape are also important. 
"I feed all my contractors. Bottled water, Gatorade, muffins, and then a variety of prepackaged snacks like chips, cookies, crackers. Sometimes I do fruit and protein/breakfast drinks if itü__s a long project. And a cash tip to the crew manager at the end. "
I have to agree with everyone suggesting sixteen.  The tough part about the grey/cream/red is that the brick you have is a warmer tone and trying to shoehorn those cooler tones in next to it won't end well.  There's enough warmth in 16 or 19 to mesh well. 
"I live in the northeast and I just purchased a house which is brick on the outside. When  I  ripped out all the sheetrock which had gotten wet, I saw that it was built with concrete block with a black coating over it.  I much prefer this to a frame house. "
"I saw a guy try to toe nail into a knot on a pine 2x4. Damn thing ricocheted off the knot and bounced up into the thumb meat in his palm. A couple reactionary tugs did not remove the nail. He had to pinch his hand between his knees to get that MFer out. "
"I would use a 1:3 mix or even richer than that.  Keep it as dry as possible --you don't really want it to ""flow"".  Definitely roughen the surface and using a bonding agent will also help.   You might consider adding small crushed aggregate too (9mm or so)."
Iü__ve never once had a builder or client request insurance information other than workers comp. workers comp is definitely something to ask for and they should have no problem providing it. Itü__s illegal for builders to pay me without a clearance letter.
"On page 4 it shows their humidifier mounted (what appears to be) directly into the side of the AC A-coil housing. This would be ideal for me, because it would put the humidifier in a very convenient location both for maintenance AND for water supply/drain!"
So I took the front panel off the air handler and I found what I believe is the time delay relay. Tried googling the numbers to no avail. But I found one that looks identical at supplyhouse.com. Part number C75-140. $33 so Iü__m willing to give it a shot. 
"Thanks. Someone recommended caulking the seam. Is that overkill. Iü__ve noticed on my MDF cabinetry that with enough stress, the paint will allow water in. Thatü__s why Iü__m wondering if proppin up the MDF on a baluster or other wood would make sense.  "
"The 6 mil is already under the concrete, per building code in literally every state. OP, definitely use self leveler - Henryü__s worked well for me. Donü__t bother adding another or 6 mil, itü__s pointless and will make the Lifeproof more difficult to lay "
"The house I bought earlier this year has beautiful 60 year old hard wood floors that I absolutely love. I'm also absolutely terrified of spilling anything on them, water damage, etc. I wish I had something like Pergo so I wouldn't have to worry so much. "
"There is an energy company that has a ton of you tube videos. They did an old house similar to this. I believe the solution was coming in from the roof, cut in a ridge vent and blow in compressed cellulose. Basically blown in insulation that is compacted. "
"Theres a reason why electricians go through studs. Simply put, its easier. The cost of an auger but will serve you for many many many holes. 1. You use less wire2. Less resistance with unnecessary wire3. Easier to insulate walls4. Passes inspections "
"VCT is VCT. Surface coating doesn't matter if it's 12by or 9by or 6by....it's all the same. 9by is a common tile size for asbestos way back in the day so I knew where you were going.&gt;for outing yourself as a dick All my friends tell me that._˘Æ_˘Æ"
"Well I'm not sure if you downvoted me, but I guess I should've been more clear: I agree that a vapor barrier shouldn't be added after initial construction. The *wood* in the attic needs to breathe. Don't want the ceiling joists trapped under vapor barrier."
"Well put, I do think we are still a bit away from the motorized options as being an everyday item however I was also looking at the AXIS ([www.helloaxis.com](https://www.helloaxis.com)). May not be a bad option but it's still absurd price for what it does."
"What happened to the old driveway that you're replacing it? Did he explain at all why you don't need gravel; like ""you already have 6"" of well compacted gravel""? Finally; is he giving you a discount for not needing to r&amp;r and compact a new gravel base?"
"Yea. Assuming that's got a lot to do with it. But there would still be expansion space on the opposing walls and within the doorway edges? Dunno. There's a ton of videos online helping people install w/o transitions, but man, losing 15 years of warranty..."
"Yeah I would like to go that route but they're too long (and from what I understand you pretty much have to throw away the extra you trim off making it a huge waste) and they don't have a direct wire option, so they wouldn't be terribly useful in my case. "
"Yep. I think it talks to the app on the phone so that it turns the heat down when nobody is home. After some time and data, it gets much better at predicting behavior and heat/cools accordingly. It was better than the static programmable one we had prior. "
"You're gonna want to find someone to break form a box don't let them weld the seams you be paying through the nose in labor time to grind, sand and blend th edges. Do it at an angle like \ / so it covers the offset flue and mates with the preexisting hood."
electricians and plumbers and hvac people i talk to all work crazy long hours... everything costs a LOT more.. licenses insurance tools... so they have to work often more than they want to. and then you're stuck doing just one type of work.. that scares me

"&gt; According to my voltage meter both black wires and the left side white from the ceiling have power coming through them.You're testing with the wire nuts in the same configuration as in the picture you posted, right? That would make sense actually. Power coming in one black wire, going to the other, going to a switch, the switch is on so it passes it to the white one, then the white comes back into the box hot. If you were testing with all the wire nuts in the box disconnected, then I am less sure. "
"&gt;any idea why the rental company would fill the house with brand new 2 prong outlets?To comply with the NEC they would have to install GFCIs at the furthest upstream outlet on each circuit and put stickers on the downstream outlets.  This probably would require hiring an expensive electrical contractor. They probably had a handy man install the two prong outlets.  No GFCIs eliminates nuisance phone calls from tenants who have no knowledge about what GFCIs do or how they function plus nuisance tripping."
"&gt;next idea is to cut each piece smooth with a tile saw and run a line of grout up the side to hide the smooth edgeThere is your answer. Slate is funky to cut and work with. Slate is built up in layers of sediment over time. These layers will separate from themselves once cut, that's called cleaving. They don't follow the score and snap method very well because each layer is either harder or softer than the next. I have had a piece of slate literally crumble in my hand after I cut it. Very frustrating. "
"An FYI for if/when your grout starts crackling/crumbling and/or you get a bit of movement in the tiles underfoot, only specific self levelers are designed with going over plank t&amp;g subfloor in mind (fibre reinforced ones), and even then it's meant to be fully secured (i.e screwed into joists) to minimize movement.Source: Flooring guy that's seen plenty of cracked relatively fresh leveling compound from people doing this, let alone tile work which can definitely be more touchy about this sort of thing."
"Charlotte is nuts with restrictive HOAs. We lived in one neighborhood in Charlotte where the HOA would not allow screens on the front facing windows. The original developer thought they were tacky and the HOA spent 25 years debating the issue. Fortunately we were only renting there for a couple of years. The other Charlotte neighborhood we lived in wouldnü__t allow a front yard swing (even if it was very nice, no plastic, etc). Front yard swings are kind of a thing in Charlotte, so I thought that was odd."
"Do you have gas oven?  Before I vented my stove to the outside my kitchen would show peaks of 40ppm.  It never sounded because it was for only short periods of time. CO danger is level + time.  19ppm isn't dangerous for most people.  OSHA puts max exposure levels at 50ppm, this is also when most CO detectors will sound immediately.HOWEVER, you need to know what is causing it!!  Venting and adjusting my oven means my levels stay at 0.  I wouldn't want to sleep in a place that has CO with no known source.  "
"Everyone commenting on how CBS walls are superior (because they are), however, if CBS is extremely rare in your area, if you ever need to have work done (windows, electrical, etc.) your local contractors might not be as familiar with it. Not saying they wouldn't be able to do the job, but if they are more familiar with frame construction. Example, my neighbor just had her son, a contractor, come down from another state to install windows. He admitted that he was a little intimidated with installing in CBS. "
"I had the same problem in our house. My dad and the contractor we hired to come look at both said ü__welcome to owning a home in the south.ü_ùDang ü__ol clay, I tell you what. You can look to rejoin the pieces as the previous comment said, or if itü__s really bad and causing you other problems youü__ll have to look into hiring a specialist. Even then, if there are site problems you may still have issues. Hence the aforementioned advice that in this part of the country it will be like that sometimes :("
"If they're the same price, get the brushless. It'll last longer, it's more powerful (overheads lost via brushes). The power delivery is digitally controlled rather than via carbon brushes.Edit.The first one is a drill driver kit while second appears to only be the drill.Haven't clicked the links, so unsure if they both come with batteries, charger etc.If you're a home user, get the kit. For every day heavy use the brushless is ideal.Second edit.Clicked the links. I don't know what's going on."
"In saying that, sections can be cut out, edges of tiles left in place can be polished to remove chips and straighten it out, or remove whole tiles and leave grout joints.Assume the drywall will come with the tiles, no chance of leaving it intact if the installer did their job correctly, and judging by the work, they did.If you want, led strips under the cupboards, changing the grout colour with a dye such as mapei fuga fresca or other changes could bring it up although the design itself is rather basic "
"Just built a fence with menards pt lumber. I went with them because I liked the cedartone color instead of the ugly greenish normal stuff. No problems with splitting, some of the 2x4ü__s warped a little bit in the rain but nothing more than expected. Posts were all solid and no issues after 4 months but we will see how the winter goes. My local place was more $, went with them for my deck cause there stuff was all perfectly straight and cheap easy delivery but wasnü__t worth the extra cost for a fence. "
"Not sure why people say match the garage to the house. There is too much brick tone already.  Yes, change the roof, but if not, it is not the end of the world.  But you need more other color.  Agree with doing the siding in a bolder saturated tone. Maybe blue, or the moss green suggested.  But rich and saturated to draw the eye from all the brick tone.  Not sure what color for the door, but not the same as house. Maybe a bold saturated redish tone but not a dull reddish tone.  &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;"
"Personally, I would remove everything, but be careful with the wood lath (assuming it's wood, disregard if it's metal) and save it.  You can nail strips of lath to the studs to use as spacers so you don't have to worry as much about the windows and doors and then go over it with 1/2"" drywall.  Just double check to make sure the lath strips + drywall isn't too thin to do the job.  Easiest way to remove the plaster is to smack it with a flat shovel to break the keys, then pull the plaster away from the walls."
"Thankfully Raid's ""flying insect spray"" doesn't use it.  I killed a bee with it once, went to go get a paper towel to clean it up, and came back to find the bee missing and a smug looking 4 month old kitten sitting there instead.  One tearful call to poison control later, we determined that the amount of d-Phenothrin and Prallethrin she'd consumed was probably not near the lethal dosage. I gave her some tuna juice and she was fine.  She's still fine now, 12 years later.  (Much bigger and fatter though.)"
"Thanks so much! Iü__m going to check out the video in the morning :) Yes it did seem rather high to me. Itü__s just him and his brother working and he said he normally charges $110 an hour for the two of them. But much if you ask me...I agree, and I asked him to give me a detailed quote with labor vs materials costs for each major segment of the remodel. He failed to do this and has so far basically gave me the ultimatum of either starting on these terms or finding someone else... seems unprofessional? "
"Thanks!I was a little leery about drilling such a large hole through that many 2x4s. If it is okay to do then that is much easier :)For the pipe, my first thought was to box it in as well, but as you can see it is runs under some steps. My concern is that the box would reduce the width of the steps, and that might be a code violation.Do you think it would be easy to lower the pipe then? I have never done anything like that with a gas pipe. So I'd almost certainly be getting a contractor in to do that."
"There was a hole underneath the shed flooring, and the nest/hive was somewhere beyond that apparently. Our shed was just a fancy entranceway for them I guess. Because they couldn't locate the actual hive they said they couldn't remove it. I back out on to a park so it could have gone anywhere really.Your family circumstances sound like you don't have the leeway we did to let them be. If you contact a local beekeeping society/group/company/whatever I'm sure they can advise you on the best course of action."
"We had this a few summers ago. We contacted a local bee specialist who initially said they could remove them, but after a second inspection we were informed that, like you, the shed was just the entrance to the  hive but not the hive itself, and so they couldn't remove them.As terrified as I am of them I didn't want to kill them, and so the bees owned my yard for a few summers. The bee people told us they wouldn't come back after the winter but they did, although I haven't seen them for a year or two now."

"first rule is to be sure the electrical circuit is disabled for any electrical demo back to junction box or breaker panel. As for plumbing, if its water lines, make sure the water is dead to the line you demoing and remove line and cap.  One rule, is no ""dead"" line should be more than 24inches long as stagnant water will become a health issue. If the plumbing lines are drains/vents, care needs to be taken something isn't removed erroneously.  This is difficult work for a novice with little or no experience."
"- Do you have any toilets that are running? If the flapper is leaking that can cause the toilet to spontaneously refill.- As others have said, baseboard heating can cause weird noises. You may need to purge the air out of the system (there should be one or more purge valves at the end of the radiators).- Do you have a sump pump that is coming on periodically?- If your fridge has an ice maker, they may spontaneously refill after finishing a batch of ice, although they are usually pretty quiet and unless you are consuming a ton of ice I wouldn't expect it to happen multiple times per night.- Does your hot water plumbing have a recirculation pump for instant hot water? This is a somewhat rare / luxury feature but in larger houses it is becoming more common."
"Cut a horizontal strip out of your drywall to \~1/2"" shy of where the cabinet will cover. Then get a 2x4 cut to the distance between studs and put pocket holes on both ends. On the right end you may need to get creative and space the pocket hole farther back but drill the hole deeper and/or at a shallower pitch. But you should be able to make it work. You could also cut the strip taller than you need and orient the pocket holes on the bottom and screw from inside the wall cavity.Then screw your cabinet into that horizontal board. That will be more than enough support and you won't have to do any drywall repair.If you add a hollow wall anchor anywhere into that equation, do it on the perpendicular wall as close to the front edge of the cabinet as you can."

"I live in a 120 year old home.  It been added onto and renovated at least 6-8 times during its lifetime.  Go into my crawlspace, and you'll find examples of every construction methodology used in the past century.  I have a good mix of galvanized, CPVC, PVC, copper and pex plumbing in my house, all dependent on what decade that area was added/renovated.  Absolutely 100% of the plumbing issues in my home have come from copper sections of pipe.  I have a copper pipe in the ceiling of my kitchen with a bucket under it right now.  Maybe it's 50 years old and past its usable life, maybe it was poorly installed, I don't know . . . but I definitely do not like it.  When I have issues, I tear out everything within reasonable reaching distance and replace with pex."
"It's unlikely that the ceiling isn't already as low as it can be. Basement ceiling height is often lower than the rest of the house either because that's how low the joists actually are, or the plumbing and/or ductwork for the main part of the house take up some of the vertical space. In some houses, the ceiling is installed at one height for consistency, but in others the height varies as it contours the utilities as needed.If the ceiling can be raised, it's because maybe someone didn't like the look of the original ceiling and decided to install an even lower one to hide it. But if the existing ceiling is already sitting directly under the joists, no, you're probably not going to be raising it without a major renovation. Unless it's just in one key spot."
"Thanks for the reply! Doors are expensive. :( I'm in touch with a local window/door company and trying to get some more information about making an appropriate choice for my desired features &amp; budget.Since you mentioned R value...Here's what I'm replacing: [https://imgur.com/a/vym9P3Q](https://imgur.com/a/vym9P3Q). I believe it's the original metal door installed 15 years ago when the home was built. Double-paned glass. If I don't close the door well enough there is visible light (and air) coming through the seal. The door is also always very cold to the touch in the winter. I feel like all my heat just radiates directly out this door in the winter. How much of an improvement do you feel a relatively cheap (&lt; $500) fiberglass door with 1/2 glass be?"
"Yeah, nails for the rails and then either nails or screws for the pickets. With treated pickets you can use galvanized or coated fasteners, so that'll save you some money. I like the small head coated screws for composite decking. Way less prone to splitting. Nailing fence pickets in by hand is kind of annoying because in the middle of the rail there you're banging against something that's not super stable. Less of an issue if you're using a gun.I really like staples just in general. They're cheap and fast and strong. But if you don't have a compressor and gun, the cost difference of renting one vs screws isn't worth it.Edit: FWIW, I did pocket holes on my fence rails. 5 years in and they're still totally solid. Backed them up with polyurethane adhesive."
"&gt;Is this valid? Or bs?We can't tell from here. Posting a question like this is like asking how much does a house cost.

"I wish my utility would do that.  My nephew was pressure washing my back patio a few weeks back and didn't turn the hose off when he was done.  The hose ended up bursting (it was an old hose) which resulted in the water running freely for 4 or 5 days until someone noticed it.  My water bill ended up being about $400 and my utility canceled the sewer charges, but wouldn't credit for the actual usage, which makes sense.They normally bill sewer based off of usage since they assume that any water that goes into the house through the meter probably goes back out through the sewer, but since in this case the water went into the ground, they credited the sewer portion of the bill and charged me my average sewer usage instead of basing it off the higher than normal usage amount.Still ended up with a $215 water bill though, when it's normally about $100.  These numbers are all rough because trash, stormwater and reclaimed water are all part of the normal $100 monthly fee.Edit: wow what gives with the downvoting?"
"I would think pretty much everything is going to need a hub (but see below), because you will need to pair the remote to the smart switch (in-line or otherwise). If you just wanted one or the other, you could go with some WiFi p.o.s.Personally, I use Lutron Caseta, but they don't have in-line switches.Just FYI, if you use an in-line switch, it would technically break Building Code, at least in the US, which requires the ability to manually cut power to the sockets, located in the usual place (or however they word that). That's not a big deal (and one that an inspector would be very unlikely to ever see and/or notice), but I'd still recommend replacing the existing switch with a smart wall switch, then adding a remote to the other side - just have two switches.For hubless wall switch, check GE. I think they have one. No clue with in-line, but there might be an option out there. What you're looking for is a smart/wireless 3-way switch, albeit with the hardwired one being in-line. Ask in /r/homeautomation."
"I assume you either have an underground storage tank (UST) and he measured from the inside or you have an above-ground storage tank (AST) and he measured from the outside. The measurements are inches and he's measuring the thickness of the tank.&gt;Visually the tank looks fine, no rust, or bubbling.Yea but you're only looking at one side. The opposite side could be rusting or corroded.&amp;#x200B;Alternatively, the tank could have been fabricated thinner than it should have been. Tanks from the 70s were fabricated *hella-thin* due to steel/oil crisis and most leaking USTs are from the 70s (in my experience). Tanks from the 60s and before, or 80s and onward, seem to hold up well.&amp;#x200B;Either way, and maybe more importantly, the company doesn't have a baseline of measurements so how they could reach the conclusion that it's actually ""deficient"" is suspect. You could ask them to remeasure it each year for a couple years to see if it's corroding over time, but they literally have a snapshot of one data point regarding the integrity of the tank. If you want to replace it, you should be good until next warm season. I'm not saying it will fail this winter, but it would be unreasonable to come to any sort of meaningful conclusion with one data point."
"If youü__re just looking to buy online and will measure and install yourself, I recommend Home Depot. They have blinds that arenü__t exactly custom, but you can order them in a variety of widths and lengths to fit any window. I did 5 windows earlier this year for less than $150 total and Iü__m super happy with them. The nice part is that since theyü__re not custom blinds, you can return them if you donü__t get the right size. I had to do this with one of my windows that I decided I wanted just a half inch bigger, and it was no problem.[Here are some pics. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/yRUhrk3). My window frames werenü__t very deep for hanging blinds so I chose to mount them to the ceiling downstairs in the bay window, and outside the frame in the bedrooms.

I also have curtains in my bedroom for extra light blockage (not pictured).[These are the ones I ordered.](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-White-2-in-Faux-Wood-Blind-35-in-W-x-64-in-L-Actual-Size-34-5-in-W-x-64-in-L-10793478068180/202040452) They arenü__t just flat blinds, they kind of have this faux wood grain texture to them that I think makes them look really nice.

"You've got two things going on in your life.  I don't know if you have a wife or kids, which changes things, but I'll assume you don't.  This may sound tough, but I think you need some tough love right now.  You're probably in your mid 20's judging by your world view.  You probably had an easy life financially until you got out of college, puttered on a few years trying to find your way, and then ended up doing something you could do with a limited skill set to pay the bills, and it's become ""you"" now, much to your chagrin.  You probably thought that if you went through certain steps in life, things would progressively get easier.  Kind of like putting in the work now to reap the rewards later, only you are just realizing that's one of the many likes that you've been duped with.  In a way, some things get easier in life as you age, but others get harder. My life now is 20x harder than it was before a family and when I was young enough that I had time to make mistakes without it being a big deal.  It sounds like you might still be young enough where you haven't made any life changing mistakes and you can still take a chance for a better life knowing it may well fail.  So take one.  Figure a way out of your current situation, and take a chance.  Move home, work part time, go to a trade school, become an electrician.  They make good money, are in demand, and you aren't killing yourself like a carpenter does all day.  Get rid of the illusion that life will get easier, or that you will make it to this level where you don't need to work.  You will work hard until the day you die and have little to show for it financially.  If you aren't the 1 percent, and you won't ever be, get those thoughts out of your head right now.  Life for most of us is our families, friends, and meaningful connections we make in life, not what we drive.  That's all your future problem.  Your current problem is today and tomorrow.  I'd say be honest with your employer.  Say I'm going through some shit right now I need a moment.  We're all human, we've all been there.  If he refuses, he's probably a shitty person to work for anyhow and you can pursue the advice I listed earlier.  TLDR: life is tough and then you die, but it doesn't have to suck if you are willing to take a chance on yourself"

"Hum, the problem with that is they have like a push button thing to fold them down, so you would need a 3rd arm to close the 3rd bracket.  Do you think maybe I could just take a pine 1x6, and attach that to the stud, then screw the brackets onto the board?"
I did smooth walls in my bedroom and bathroom for a remodel. They had a knock down texture before. The painter appeared to apply another texture to the walls then smoothed that down before painting. It did seem like a decent amount of work and quite dusty.

If there was a tub I would want giant soaking tub or no tub (like a bigger shower in its place). Ours has a tiny tub like 12-14 inches deep and itü__s useless and I wish I just had a giant shower instead (we bought it this way and plan to redo eventually).

"It was a few lights with incandescent bulbs. Two overhead lights with two 60W bulbs each is 240W easy. Or four 65W cans. I don't remember the exact combination. This was 2007 when LED bulbs were not ubiquitous like today, and CFL bulbs were not always nice."

"Sounds awesome! I dont have a lot of insight into costs for that stuff BUT, doing window treatments right now for myself and they are pricey so you may want to work that into the budget as well. 15 ft floor to ceiling windows would probably be a few grand. "
"The ground is simply not very good insulation, and it's not very warm in the winter either.Yes, it is better than the above-ground air, but that doesn't mean it's *good*.This is why basement insulation is standard practice and part of the building code."
"The house was originally a 1 story, with the second story being added sometime in the 70s.I believe its classified as a 1.5 story because the second story does not go the full length of the house... Only two bedrooms on top of the back half of the house. "

"To me that looks like a semi transparent stain that has failed due to sitting on top of the wood instead of penetrating the fibers. Get yourself a good random orbital sander, some 80 grit paper, and sand it all down. Stain with penetrating oil based stain. "
Try removing the middle screw from the jamb side of the top hinge and using a 3 or 3 1/2ü_ù screw to try and pull the top of the jamb in toward the framing a bit. Sometimes it can just tighten up enough to gain you the space you need for it to stop rubbing.

"Vapor-pressure correlates very strongly with the surface-area of the top of the liquid-LPG in the tank, so using a Y-hose or triple-hose to involve 2 or 3 tanks will be a good method of increasing vapor pressure, especially as ambient temperature decreases."
"We have different friends. So far, my friends and I have swapped a transmission, replastered a pool, chopped down hundreds of trees, built a deck, built a mother-in-law suite in a garage, and much more. Money is never involved. The favor is always returned."
"Well Iü__m not a fan of carpet. But itü__s not super expensive to replace. And if you do it before the furniture comes in it will be easier and not as expensive as your not moving furniture. Then you e got another 10 years before you have to do it again. "
"Yarp, single vapor barrier or none, but never 2.  I'm sure there are certain climates where it doesn't really matter all that much, you just get lucky, northfacing walll or something weird where it won't be a problem.  There is always an exception somehow."
"Yeah I may go ahead and take down some drywall and see how much has been affected. I do not think they are active, I've been up in the attic a lot and not seen anything up there, and there's nothing in the widow sill that's only 2 feet away from that spot. "
"Yes, it is head wall flashing. So I have 1 end of the L-flashing under the side shingles, one end over top of the last row. Is this correct? Would not covering the nails cause the water? Maybe I need to strip the stretch of roof and look for cracks instead."
"You're right, but I've ever only lived here so I thought it was normal.  How does it work elsewhere?  Do they have a meter on the sewer line?We have reclaimed water for watering lawns and that is a flat fee (there's a meter, but it's apparently not used)."

"""best"" is pretty subjective.  Energy efficiency would be based on the spec's of the window. If you have 5 window manufacturers with a window from each to same ""spec"", they should all perform as ""spec'd"", then it goes back to specifics of the window itself.  A $300 window can perform to the ""energy efficiency""  as well as $1000 window.  Goes back to functionality of the window, solid wood, wood veneered, vinyl clad, aluminum clad, solid vinyl or a combination. Longevity and warranty is another factor as well."
"&gt; *who the h\*\*\* pays monthly payments on something for 30 years just to have to return the item when the lease is over?* Eh, that's what *leasing* means. The whole point of solar leasing is that you get the cost savings of solar power without having to bear the upfront cost of purchasing the panels AND without being responsible for most maintenance costs. By the end of the lease period you'd need new panels anyway.Having said that, the industry has mostly moved away from this model so there's that."
"Ah ok. Find out if the lights in the kitchen and dining room are on the same circuit. If they aren't, call the electric company because there may be a problem with the transformer or line coming in. If they're on the same circuit, turn it off and find out what else is on the circuit, then see if those devices have the same symptom. Chances are there's a loose connection somewhere on the lighting circuit. Hopefully the microwave isn't on the same circuit as the lights; it requires a dedicated circuit by code."
"I don't know if it was always slanted, my parents bought the house last year.  The main part of the house to the left is on elevated ground no wetlands but there aren't any gutters so rain comes off the roof and lands by the posts. I mentioned putting in gutters and downspouts to my mother today. Could rainwater, overtime be enough to soften the ground and allow the posts to sink?  If you look closely, you can see where the water lands. There's a line in the grass that runs up to the wing mirror of the car. "
"I prefer the magnet stud finders because they are, in my experience, more fool proof. You do have to remember that the screws they used to hang the sheet rock (what the magnet is attracted to) are not going to be at the same height on each stud. There may be a stud at 16ü_ù but there arenü__t any screws around.  Iü__ll often have to use other methods like knocking to hear the difference, looking for irregularities in the drywall to see the seams where a stud would be, drilling tiny holes until I hit a stud. "
"I read it. Like most things, itü__s not that black &amp; white that one type of sensor is better than the other. Smoke inhalation is the most common killer in home fires, not the heat of a ü__low smoke high flameü_ù fire. Nest Protect are effective smoke detectors that take steps to minimize false alarms and low battery chirps - both things that make people say ü__this thing is broken, Iü__m taking it downü_ù. A functional smoke detector is better than one that has been taken down or had the battery removed."
"I see that now. I was initially looking at the broken (or cut) copper wire poking out of the top stab and thinking that's the breakage. I've had older stab backs disintegrate while removing them, but it's usually due to my prying on the corroded release. Never had one come apart like that. I'm a fan of the stab back, and all of my z-wave smart plugs have them exclusively to save space. I get the impression that this was either a crap switch, or that there was some amount of excessive stress put on that wire."

"Like I said depending, if you can feed the circuits at other places then all you have to do is cap off the wire's your aren't using anymore in boxes and forget about them. It may be attic work, it may be some crawl space work or it may be ripping drywall out. When we're trying to do minimum damage I like to use a 6"" hole saw, when you're done wiring you just take some 1 by or whatever extra wood you have laying around and the core back on the wall so you can just mud where the saw cut the hole and that's it."

"You are partially correct.

"Depends on whether you're talking about weather sealing it or connecting the fan duct to the hood. If you're talking weather sealing, the vent is laced in to the roofing material, and no sealing is needed on the attic side.For connecting the duct to the hood - which is what I'm assuming you're talking about - it depends on the type of vent currently installed. If I'm seeing the conditions correctly in the photos, that duct terminates immediately below a roof vent with no connection. This isn't code-allowable, at least in my area. You'll need a vent hood meant for this application installed on the roof, which will have a connection for hard pipe or flex duct depending on the route you want to go. Seal the connection between pipe and vent hood with foil tape."

"No, the OPs reference to clocks syncing to ""the grid"" is in reference to the power distribution grid.  At one point it was quite common for clocks and timers to utilize the 60Hz (or 50Hz in Europe and other areas), to keep time.  Now that most things are digital, clocks and timers are using internal frequency clocks to keep time.In order for the clock to speed up that fast though, the microwave would be sending electromagnetic interference back into the circuit, as another has stated.  There is no way that the frequency of the power supply has changed, unless its being ran off a backyard generator, power utilities take great care to keep the power grid at the correct frequency as it being even the slightest bit off can mess up the power utilities equipment."
"Unless you need a specific surface finish or have to use a product that for whatever reason can't simply be brushed on, it's going to be really hard for an amateur to beat a big paint roller + handle extension. Between protecting areas that are not supposed to be painted, cleaning and caring for the spray gun, getting the masks and filters etc, you end up spending a lot of time on other things than painting, in order to save time on painting.With a roller, paint can, paint tray and some paper to protect against dripping you are good to go in a moment, and you can leave it and start up again with minimal prep. Just scoot the furniture aside as you go along while you paint the walls.If you have to live there while painting, a sprayer is a pain in the ass."

"You're right that in the heating season you'd probably save money by stuffing the gaps with dollar bills - that's a lot of gaps.Obviously the best solution which preserves the current look would be to access it from above.  I know you said access is difficult - could you use sheets of rigid insulation foam?  Depending on how bad the access is, you might somehow tape the joints as you go, and end up with a much more sealed ceiling then you have now.Only other option without painting I would consider is maybe black caulk?  It would match your beams and the contrast might not look bad, especially since you'd be applying it in the shadow areas.  You could buy a tube, try it on a small area, and if it looks like crap it would only take a few minutes to remove."
"a HE washer is absolutely worth buying, if you have an older, agitator type. they use a less water and power. i think they also put less wear on the clothes. they have sensors to put in just the right amount of water.the major bonus is they spin a lot more water out of the clothes, so the dryer has to do less work, and line-drying is quicker. saves power and time. mine cost about $500 new (topload kenmoore). picked the model specifically because i needed to run it off a solar PV system with a fairly small (2000watt) inverter. the downside is you have to be careful when loading bulky stuff (blankets and quilts) because they can go off balance and shake like crazy. mine shuts off when it senses an unbalance. annoying, but better than having it shake apart.

"I put in Wicanders Cork Comfort on slab. Easy install, did it myself. The best solution is probably cork glued down (with a no-voc glue), but Wicanders looked like they had everything set up pretty well with the floating floor. I really love it. On my upper floors I have bamboo - teragren synergy. Another manufactured product that shouldnü__t offgas, and itü__s incredibly tough. Itü__s nailed down where it can be, but there are spots they had to glue it. It can also be installed as a floating floor. Stay away from the lvt.  There is one that claims good air quality scores, but thereü__s better stuff out there. I think US floors sometimes sells a good cork floating floor through Loweü__s, but you really have to check what they are selling online against what they emit.

"It's definitely got asbestos in it, and asbestos is so fine that it goes through any filter that isn't rated to block it.  And asbestos fibers are worse than other fibers of the same size because they're rough and get stuck in the lungs permanently, rather than get expelled in a week, as smooth fibers do.  Even if I had an asbestos-approved vacuum cleaner, I'd want it to vent outside.  Then I'd toss the vacuum, but I don't know if you should hose it off first. Don't scrape, vacuum, or sand.  The safest but still improper way for a DIYer to remove asbestos-containing popcorn ceiling is by using a spray pump bottle containing water and a  4"" - 6"" wide putty knife, wetting down a small area and scraping it off into a bucket lined with a plastic bag.  You really should wear an asbestos-approved filter mask and bunny suit (disposable overalls, preferably asbestos-rated) while doing this.  After you're done, wipe down everything -- ceiling, walls, floors -- with damp sponges or paper towels that you'll throw away "
"Iü__m far for a HVAC expert but here are my thoughts:I would seriously consider switching to a natural gas boiler if itü__s available in youü__re area. Itü__s cleaner, cheaper and requires less maintenance. The issue of switching your hot water to your boiler is a bit of a tradeoff. If you already have a hot boiler (in winter) the additional cost of oil to heat your water will be minimal. However in summer youü__re boiler will continue to run periodically to keep your water hot which will be more expensive than an electric hot water heater. Youü__re basically trading a more efficient and cheaper system in the winter for a more expensive system in the summer. Given that youü__re in New Hampshire this is likely an ok trade off.You should check out the heatinghelp.com forum. Itü__s full of ridiculously smart and helpful heating experts. I would post your question along with some pics of your system they will tell you the best way to proceed. Just know that they donü__t discuss price over there. Good luck!"
"Wow, that was certainly not our experience, goes to show how big a difference region makes. In Minneapolis we were looking at the sub $300 range, the bare minimum for a home in decent repair in a \*not bad\* part of the city, and 75% of the homes we looked at (all in the 250 to 300 range) had stone countertops. The only ones that had laminate were the ones that looked like they had not been updated since the 80s. An anecdote, though. The previous owner of our home ""remodeled"" the kitchen right before selling, I imagine to help with the sale. I wish they hadn't. Bottom of the barrel granite, sheet vinyl, cabinets, appliances, everything. Literally the cheapest possible. I know this because we are remodeling it now, the right way. Removing walls, fixing electric, etc. I would have much preferred the original kitchen and lower price! Something to consider, too.&amp;#x200B;If you don't mind the durability, look, and feel of the nice laminate, then by all means go that route and save the dough!!&amp;#x200B;"
"Ah. At least floating floor is easy to rip up! :)Are you linking up the floating floors or using a transition piece between doorways?Haha, fair enough man. Proper transition bars are pretty costly too unfortunately :(As to your other post, self smoother would be used for the purposes of matching height to the leftover existing vinyl (i.e filling in where there's no vinyl anymore). Unfortunately, there *may* be bonding issues in this situation, as well as structural integrity with self smoothing products. It's sort of a 50/50 gamble as to how well it'd work in reality as the subfloor beneath it all (wood) may expand/contract, causing self smoother to crack. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.If you want to go *over* the leftover vinyl, you'd need a primer designed to go over non-porous surfaces, and you'd probably want at least a latex modifier for additional strength, ideally a fibre modified self leveler, but both options to gain integrity require a height gain (they have a minimum thickness requirement) :/ Are those tiles in the picture actually adhered down yet or not? As that could be problematic in terms of height.Honestly, I'd probably consider removing the rest of the vinyl and the backing at this point, keeping it damp and using scrapers."
"Any settling, especially within only a month, shouldn't really have anything to do with your floor feeling ""squishy"". What kind of subfloor do you have? I'm a flooring installer and I know that sometimes, especially with vinyl plank, if it is installed incorrectly or if the subfloor was uneven or had dips in it that weren't corrected, the floor will feel fine at first while it has it's ""new floor rigidity"", but then as it breaks in, will start to conform to those dips in the subfloor. As for the cracks that seem larger, take a pencil and lightly mark where they are now and see if they are really getting bigger. You may have just not noticed how big they were when you first bought it. Angles and different lighting can also hide or exaggerate cracks in walls.As for the drain, I'm not super familiar with plumbing, but from what I know it could be as simple of a problem as hair or grease in the drain that needs to be cleaned out.Don't worry, owning a home is one of the most amazing feelings, but also terrifying. My advice is to not panic, keep a running list of things that need repair, and just knock them out one by one. Make sure that if they're not done by a professional, they are done very correctly by you, or you will end up doing things twice. Good luck!"
"First, I am not an electrician, so please verify these claims. My statements about wire colours apply to the UK ü__ not sure about other countries:The blue is neutral and the brown is live. You want to connect them to corresponding colours in other wiring. Or if you have older red/black wiring, connect red to brown and black to blue. In a screw bulb fixture, you want the live connected to the bottom and neutral to the side, to make it harder to touch the live if the bulb is out and the lamp is powered.If you use the colours wrong but otherwise connect everything correctly it should work fine, but I assume it will be against code and can confuse future you or other future owners, which could conceivably be dangerous.Different gauges of wire will support different wattages. I think if your wire is under-dimensioned you risk overheating and fire.  Typically with a light fixture the wattage will be low. If it has two 40w bulbs, thatü__s 80w.  Modern bulbs will have much lower wattages, but you should consider that a future owner could put an old style bulb in there. Also, sounds like youü__re keeping the lampholders and part of the old wires? Those might need replacing as well depending on their condition. I couldnü__t tell you how to assess that, though."
"Central Oregon, Cali Bamboo, floating installation.Our installation was in April, and has been 95% successful so far. Make sure you follow the installation instructions thoroughly, especially if you're having a contractor do it, because they have a habit of assuming things that are incorrect.(Honestly, if you have the time, I'd recommend just buying a good miter saw and doing all the work yourself.)In Central we have issues with too low humidity, and in Eastern you probably do as well. But make sure it acclimates as per the instructions (ie: longer acclimation period), and it should be okay. They say it _should_ be kept at 40% humidity, but with one exception, we haven't noticed any problems with indoor humidity changing between 30%-40%. We're planning to install a humidifier at some point, but we purchased our house this year as well so money is tight at the moment (quoted $3000).The 5% exception is a single plank that ended up with both the fridge and the oven feet on it after install. The weight is too much to allow it to move with the rest of the floor, so we ended up with a feelable seam when the other boards breathed away from it as the humidity went down. (Although contractor sloppiness is another theory we have.)Since ours is free-flowing, this could be fixed, but we haven't gotten around to it yet.Remember that the success of a floating floor depends on it having room to expand/contract. Do a full _half-inch_ gap around all walls (not quarter; you'll want some shoe moulding), and try not to weigh down boards with obscene amounts of weight which hinder movement. Our boards ""flared"" and ""clicked"" for a bit at first, but after installing baseboards/shoes and the boards had a chance to settle down (about a month or two), we haven't noticed any clicking.Only recommendation I'd have is consider holding off on installing baseboards/shoes/t-moudling along your final run for a couple months so you can see how the boards settle and make any adjustments before making the edges more difficult to access."

You can in most cases, if you have a shut off at the house, check your house for leaks independent of your mainline by closing off our house valve and using a hose or laundry bib. I would have offered a spot repair on your main line, or full main line replacement also recommended a new PRV if yours was bad, and def suggested a new water heater if I was there and could verify age and condition. Good luck Plumber"

"&gt; As a tiler, ill bet that bathroom would look great if the grout was redone.&gt; &gt; same. I was like man, that tile looks great!!I agree with everything he says. I'm retired from doing tile for a living, but, this is exactly what I would have done"
"&gt; If you need multiple flushes, the savings goes down the drainThis is why I'd get the 1.28 vs. the 1.0 gpf toilets.  The 1.28 is designed for the amount of water and it's still enough water to properly keep it clean.  Less than that and it gets... iffy."
"&gt; Took me about 30 minutes if that and I was done.  Nah, you're done for now.  Give it a couple years and the frost will heave that concrete blob up to the surface, where you'll find it with your mower blade.  Don't leave chunks of concrete in your yard."
"&gt; Water/moisture will always find a way in, it needs an easy way out. By the argument there's not reason to apply moisture barriers anywhere.  Further most homes have a variety of places for moisture to already escape, even if it's just an air exchanger."
"&gt;Then tells me it's $125 to haul it away to the trash.This is the point I would have told him to get the eff out of my house and not come back.  Charging for it is fine but be upfront about it.  Not telling you until he rips everything out is very shady."
"&gt;if you don't have the correct tool for any part of the job, don't try and make due with what you have. Buy or rent the appropriate tool. This is very good advice and also the reason we have a ridiculous number of tools. Husband prefers to buy, not rent."

"2 in rigid foam is R10, you need at least R30, R60 would be better. I am guessing those are 2x6 joists? I would bring them out at least another 3.5 inches, giving you 8 inches which is R40. Spray foam is and even better option, but will cost more of course."
"Agreed on humidistats on fans - reviews for these are very poor.On the window though- opening the window on a freezing cold winter's morning of -4 or - 5 celsius I wouldn't fancy.Is there not a way to have enough air in room without having a window open . "
Also depends on how much cycling you do. 1-2% per year is what I frequently see. A number of manufacturers will include a normal rate of degradation in their warranty so you'd be covered if for some reason your battey's performance falls outside those bounds.
"Another option I use for contours is an aggressive scouring pad with a healthy concentration of TSP and a nylon bristled brush.  Once dry, a light scuff with a fine sanding block to knock down any raised grains.  Great for getting into the really tight spots."
Are you putting the right doors in the right frames?  Check the hinges are tight on both the door and the frame.  Are the top and bottom hinges plumb with each other?  If they're off even a tiny bit it'll mess up the door.  Are doors a pain in the ass?  Yes. 
"Can you call on your light without opening the garage door?  If you can, listen for a small relay ""click"" when you turn your light on.  If no ""click"" it could be your controller board.  I am not completely sure if this will work for your unit but worth a try."
Check out connect homes.  There is a guy in Orinda that reps them and owns one.  Heü__s super helpful. Also a guy Sonoma that built a small one for his mom. We have been considering buying land and going modular and Iü__m liking everything Iü__ve seen so far.
Disengage your opener by pulling the release cable then see how well the door opens by hand. It should lift up and stay up on its own at the half way point and all the way up. If it doesn't then the tension spring or the pulley cable isn't adjusted properly. 
"Everything has always been a shit show, don't let anecdotes fool you, it's just all the people who aren't satisfied now have a place to shout it to the world. If 500 reviews say ""this fucking thing broke in a month!"", that's 500 of of what is likely millions."
"For what itü__s worth... We donü__t have any serious water problems (high humidity sometimes is about if) but went with these and love them. Easy to install, no worries about them even with a water leak, and they look and feel great so far. Been about 1 year."
Grew up in paving as well and dirt is not a base. Also 1ü_ù base isnü__t enough. New install should have at least 4ü_ù and 6ü_ù if there is clay. Also you have to install asphalt in lifts of 1-1/2 for it to compact properly. You also need a 3 to 5 ton roller.
"Guess I'm lucky. Furnace, water heater, range and fireplace valves are all within reach of each other just after the gas main passes through my foundation.  Flex line after the valves to to the range and fireplace. Maybe I'll fugure out who that plumber was. "
"Hey thanks for the quick reply.  Do you think that that will be enough to ""glue"" the frame back down to the plastic base in addition to making it water tight?  Should I pick the metal up and put silicone underneath or just seal the two edges on either side?"
"I don't think the other commenters are seeing that the issue is the door frame sticking out beyond the stud framing. What happened with the layout of that? I'm not a drywaller but I suppose if it were me at this point, I would layer drywall to bring it flush."
"I have 4 of them, they are terrible, connection problems constantly, firmware upgrade problems, replay is awful, terrible app, no web viewer and lots of of other issues, these are more like a toy cam, I wouldnü__t trust them to monitor anything I cared about."
I know someone whoü__s teenage daughter burned the house down because she was heating food on the stove and got so involved with her phone in the next room she forgot about it. Whole house needed to be knocked down and rebuilt. No problem with the insurance. 
"I still prefer a mechanical connection that proper twisting  provides, especially for outlets since they jump to other areas, as do most electricians I've seen in the US but if someone doesn't have proper technique then they're a lot better than this mess.   "
"I would get three quotes and also see if those companies require 50% down before starting. That part seems strange. I wouldn't pay anyone unless they've completed the work. If this was to cover pain, that's a different story but it doesn't look like it does. "
"I would say to go ahead and rent a drywall lift and use it to get the plywood up in place. They aren't that expensive to rent for a day and after having done 5 rooms in my house alone without one, I finally gave and rented one. It was a religious experience. "
I'd suggest checking Amazon before you buy from Wayfair - I found a couch I loved but they were out of stock for months. Found the same couch on Amazon and got it in 2 days and like 35 bucks cheaper and I got to read a few more reviews to make up my mind lol.
"I'm seeing a lot of recommendations to prime before skim coat. Thinking I do the following:Joint compound holes, scrape loose paint. Then prime with a bonding primer for any remaining scraps. Followed by skim coat of joint compound, more primer, then paint."
I've done this very project. You have to buy an outlet kit for a wall. The bottom is a Male plug that you plug an extension cord into. The top is a traditional female receptacle. In between in a short length of romex to keep with code. It's very simple to do.
"If I'm not mistaken, you can purchase the system after like 5-6 years of it being installed at a way cheaper price. Might be worth calling and seeing what the buyout is. Out here in CA, solar will pay for itself in 7-8 years, depending on roof angles and such"
"If you are asking if you should see what the subs charge your contractor to do the work... nope. Doesn't work that way.&amp;#x200B;However, if you have the time and organizational skills, you can contract out all the work your self and save a buck or two."
"If you are improving the insulation of your house, you will get by far the best bang for your buck sealing up any drafts first. Under a door, between window panes? Around a chimney? Anywhere you can see daylight coming in is a HUGE source source of heat loss."
"If you have cast iron radiators and they have air in them they will behave this way    There is a bleed screw on the top , some can be done with a small screwdriver, most need a radiator key available at any hardware store . A PICTURE WOULD REALLY HELP HERE "
It was definitely some wood shade. It probably wasnü__t this dark. The dark stain is likely to cover up old scuffs and dings. Yeah painting it white will be easier than stripping and sanding and re staining. Itü__s your house and you should do what you like. 
Just some left over R15- my big issue with this was I couldnü__t reach the top plate to staple the baffle and a helpful member of this sub suggested I use a stick to jam a piece of insulation in place to block the cellulose from the eaves which worked great. 
"Just want to point out to other readers that this is in fact an addition to the house, which appears to be a pretty nice house, tying in to roof lines and so forth so that it looks like it ""belongs.""This isn't adding another garage bay to a detached garage."
"LED tech is not ready for dimmers yet. I put them in the kitchen and bedroom and only the high quality bulbs dim properly end even then thereü__s a noticeable flicker and hum. When we do the bathroom I am putting in a designated nighttime light and switch. "
"Maybe consider some of the grout renew on the walls and install a vinyl interlocking floor over the existing floor. You can remove the tile, install floor and reinstall the toilet for a clean look. Some of the new vinyl interlocking flooring looks like tile. "

"My foundation was poured five months ago. It's new construction. Where I live (New England), it would be VERY unusual to pin the slab to the foundation. Are you also saying that the footings are poured at the same time as well? What part of the world/country?"
My local Ace hardware usually has them organized. Plus they have someone hanging around to help you with what you need. That guy stated that he rather help everyone out first because if they start going through it then he has to clean it up later that night. 
"My neighbors irrigation was flooding my yard, she did nothing when I brought it to her attention.   I built a mound of pea gravel against the fence.   Hearing her family through the other side debate why her yard suddenly started flooding was very satisfying."
"Never let your sheets or bedding contact the floor and minimize the surface area where the legs contact the floor.  Keep the bed away from the wall and clean the floor often.You should take care to get all bugs out of the house though, not just the bedroom."
Nicotine.  if someone smoked in the house it gets on the ceilings and walls.  it needs to be washed before painting.  for the stuff you already painted you can try applying very light coats so it does not have much time to soak through while the paint is wet.
"Probably more pictures are needed, but besides the mummy coming out at the top... it's not as bad as it seems. Specially if you have not had water damage. You should totally have it checked but it does not seem like you'll need to take it all down. Good luck!"
"Sorry. I posted this quickly this morning and should have added more detail. I stripped the varnish. Sanded them down. Cleaned with mineral oil, then cleaned with tac cloth. Painted with primer from Sherman Williams and Emerald paint from Sherman Williams. "
"Start with your furnace/HVAC system. What is it? Electric, fuel oil, coal, nuclear? Kidding. Next, check the main air filter if it has one. There should not be any cloth or insulation exposed in your heating system. Get a shop vac and clean all that out asap."
That reminds me of a product that was out about 20 years ago (don't know if they're still around) to control water leakage into a basement.  Basically you'd drill holes in the wall and a plastic dam would be glued to the floor to route water to a floor drain.
The compressor did probably shut off but the fan often stays running for a little bit to dry off the evaporator. The cracking noises were most likely the ice coating the evaporator cracking once it started to get warm as the pressure in the system equalized. 
The leaves and sticks may decompose but you'd never be able to tell. This guy has 3 big gum trees in his back yard which means it's always going to be covered in twigs and leaves pretty much all year round and his chance of growing a proper lawn is buckley's 
"The paperwork says ü__radiant heatü_ù. I see lots of vents through the house. Not sure what type of duct work exists as a result of that type of heat or if it can be repurposed at all. Sorry, Iü__m not very knowledgeable yet relative to what I have exactly."
"To support this, when HE washers first started to proliferate I did a ROI based on Energystar ratings, detergent and water usage.  I could get a $250 washer or a $1100 washer, both would cost the same over 10 years to operate.  Ever try to find a $250 washer?"
"Use floor fans pointed at the wet areas to encourage drying.  A one time event is not likely to cause significant damage, especially since you attempted to clean it up immediately.Don't know why the replacement spigot is dripping.  It's a new unit, correct?"
"What else is there to it, generally speaking? I would definitely flip the main breaker to kill all power to the rest of the house. It looks like I would have to do some breaker swapping to get the surge protector breaker as close to the main line as possible."

Would you say the same about natural gas steam boilers? I have a Weil McLain with a 1991 build date that seems to be healthy but Iü__m concerned about a $10k boiler replacement popping up in the dead of winter. Not sure what expected life is on these things. 
"Wow. Great plan.  Even if you don;t like landlording, you could put it with a property manager and collect a check every month.   I don't know detroit, but I know there are up and coming areas, so hopefully it will be worth a lot more when you sell someday.  "
"Yeah, I think that is my notion.  But the sump was top of the list before the leak.  We are in West Michigan and have been getting lots of rain.  Water table is super high.  Iü__m not sure when the sump wonü__t be able to keep up.Edit:  thanks for the luck!"
"Yeah, there's always that point of no return lol.  But now your house is so much more valuable and you didn't have to pay someone else.  Without you it would have still been an unlivable dump.  You made a place to live whether you choose to live there or not!"

You can get an [angle grinder](https://www.harborfreight.com/4-12-in-43-amp-angle-grinder-69645.html) with metal cut off wheels for under $20 at Harbor Freight. Would make quick work of that roof. Just got one to break up an above ground pool. Worked wonders.
"just sounds like your garage is comparing apples to oranges vs OPs. He's matching siding (which surely has plywood underneath) insulation, heating ect. Obviously his bid is a bit high, but he's not going to get the garage he wants for under probably $30-40k"
tradespeople/contractors can all work for T&amp;M = hourly labor rate and material cost....there will be a minimum charge as no one is going to perform a job for less than 4 hours of time charged even it is 15 minutes.  They have overhead and profit to cover.
"From Texas. Here you would have to pay an impact fee per property. This can cost upward of $10k each lot and then cover the expenses for extending the main as well as pay a permit fee to cover inspection and approval  for the new line and connection.Reason for all the fees is after the construction the city will take ownership of all main and service laterals in the ROW, as well as be required to maintain sewer service for that property from now on, and you are only responsible for the part in your property. "
"I would keep an eye on it, but it should dry out just fine. You may need to redress the seam a bit if it bubbles, but it should be ok.My question is were they spraying the soffit? And how good is the ventilation in the roof? Cuz air circulation up there is going to be important.Another note, that looks like mild water damage from the skylight, but I canü__t tell for sure. You may want to double check the seals on the flashing for the skylight housing on the roof to ensure it isnü__t dry rotted and leaking."
"I would paint the door, garage door and shutters -- maybe black.  I'd consider painting the steps at the same time.I'd change the front porch light fixture - something that hangs down, and get rid of the one over the garage altogether.We just put windows into our garage door.  It was super easy and inexpensive.  We took out some panels and replaced them with a frosted plexi.  It made a huge difference.  The windows in your garage really date the house.I'd think about a simple portico over the front door."
"If you dont want to be elevated in the middle of your yard, beeing seen or seeing neighbors over the fence, then do a low deck. I Built a small deck (8'x4') to serve as a safe landing out my back door(50 y.o. house) and get stairs with a handrail. Back door opened directly to three brick steps and concrete patio. Deck allows you to exit onto flat ground, open and close the door and put a chair or plants on it, then three steps down to the patio. Patio shrunk a bit but still fits table and chairs comfortably."
"Is there a window in the stairwell that you could prop open a crack? May create alternative egress for the smoke. Find a way to create positive pressure in your unit, so the smoke isn't being sucked into your space. A fan blowing in from one of your windows could help.Weatherstripping will help some.But start by talking to the guy. Tell him what is happening, but don't be confrontational. Just let him know how's it's affecting you and ask if he might consider smoking near a window or setting up a fan. "
"Looking at the condition of the expansion it appears you have a lot of movement in the walkway, freeze/thaw, The Sika self leveling is an ok choice but you have to make sure the backer rod seals it up because that stuff is runny and you wont feel like you ever will fill the joint. I would avoid the polymeric sand, you have to much movement for that to last. A better choice, though it requires some skill, would be backer rod and a modified urethane, comes in a lot of colors and is designed for this application!"
"Thanks. So theyü__d just have to replace the board? What would that run me with no warranty. Looks like a whole new HZ311 is only $100 or so bucks.Iü__m thinking I should probably be covered by my builder since Iü__m 3.5 years into what is a 5 year warranty. I canü__t remember the exact terms on the AC warranty but I think thatü__s itThey gave everyone in the neighborhood these Lenox units with faulty evap coils. Mine has been fine thus far. Not sure if that is at play. From the symptoms Iü__m thinking no."
"The simplest thing this could be is a dry trap. Often in floor drains, traps dry out and then sewer gas gets in. Also that unused sink in the spare bathroom. . One of my yearly chores is to go around and pour water in every floor drain. Unlikely there is a dry trap on your garbage disposall, but laundry (dryers) can pull air out of the house, drawing it in from the sewer. Your house also draws air just from stack effect. Try running water in all the sinks and tubs, and floor drains before you call a plumber."
"Thereü__s a chance they didnü__t know about these problems. I canü__t afford all those inspectors youü__re getting and am planning on selling my house come spring. I know it needs new siding, the AC unit is old, and the shed needs a new roof, but thatü__s about it. Itü__s very possible there are more issues, but I donü__t plan on finding out. Iü__m really hoping I donü__t fuck over the new owners! Iü__ve loved living there for 7 years, but got divorced and canü__t afford it anymore need a change of scenery. "
"Tipping off is probably the biggest difference between ""meh"" and miraculous. Flotrol can be helpful.A quality blocking primer should be used, regardless of how many different ""XYZ In-One"" the paint product claims to be. Using a drywall knife at the angles where the wall meets the ceiling (or any where) as a cut guard helps.Take a flat-bladed screw-driver and scrap the ceiling gently at the angle. It will likely be unnoticable, but flattening that tiny bit will allow for painting a much more neat line. "
"Almost always seed grass in the fall.  There are several reasons&amp;#x200B;1) in early Spring you need to put down pre-emergent.  This prevents grassy weeds, not by killing them, but preventing the seeds from germinating.  If you seed in Spring, the pre-emergent will prevent your seed from germinating, too  2) Planting in the Spring will require your grass to possibly have to survive a hot Summer immediately after sprouting.  A lot of it will die, and you will have to water it a LOT the first year. It can be done, but it will not be as strong the first season or two.  3) planting in Fall, then hitting it with Winterizer will help it grow deep roots since the grass will be held out of dormancy for the Winter.  Since the top can't grow, the roots will."
"Codes and regulations. You know, The reason you pay a plumber, because he knows these things. Sometimes the price is high because local codes and regulations state you cannot have joints or underground, that you cannot bury a soldered joint or sharkbite fitting. The codes are there to protect others. What happens when that joint fails, sucks in dirt and contamination via siphoning or a backflow event and makes the neighbors sick. These things happen and are why professionals have to do what they do. It's all a liability. Professionals know the ins and outs, the why's and how's and the codes, regulations, and reasons they exist.Don't just think about yourselves.

"Depends. For my townhouse in the basement my laundry room has open ceiling and you can see the block sitting on top of the concrete foundation walls.Otherwise try drilling for the tapcons.

"Don't let it just suck. Tell people about it. The only protection consumers have against shady contractors is other people letting them know who they are dealing with.    You had this happen because nobody told you, or you couldn't find out on your own. Don't be the second broken link in that chain.    And I am the more expensive contractor. I come behind screwup contractors all the time, to fix their fuckups. Most good contractors do. And we don't like it anymore than you do. It makes ***us*** look bad until we fix it. And people rarely tell others about us.

"You said you believe its cement, But then mentioned the liner is hanging and is wavy in places. If you see a liner (usualy made of blue vinyl) that means is a liner pool. These usually have steel or aluminum walls behind the liner, and a cement looking floor typically made out of something called vermiculite.You may be able to get this up and running by simply getting a new liner installed. (It's possible the liner was ripped and leaking, and the elerley couple didn't want to put the money in to replace it). Since you are in a warm area, you shouldn't have to worry about cracked pipes underground due to freezing and not being winterized properly. Not sure on the size of the pool, but you're proably looking at $4-$6k to get it replaced, depending on a lot of things. This isn't really a do it yourself job, I'd just call some local pool companies and get a few quotes. They can likely check out the rest of the pool for you and see if anything else needs to be replaced. Possibly installing a new pump and filter. "
"$90-$100/ hour sounds on the low end, especially in Chicago where everything has to be metal clad and stricter rules and electricians don't usually fix holes so it sounds like a handyman.  I would not trust a handyman with any electrical work because I've seen their ""handy work"" and it's usually pretty terrible and they're doing unlicensed work.But yes, it's possible to knock out the recessed light, use the wiring for that for the electrical box and jump off that for the next one. Depending on the construction method used, it could be either a lot of damage involved or just the original hole that needs to be patched.Edit: I just scrolled down and I thought you meant a recessed light.  What you have now is going to be more complicated because the wire may not reach from the original box to the new location and you can't leave a splice up in the ceiling and bury it (although people do).   The right way is to keep the original box there and fish a new line to it and then just blank the old box. The even more right way which nobody will do is to run a whole new line from the switch which people would only do if the walls were gutted. Again, if you're in Chicago, there could very well be a conduit going to the box so this simple thing has potential to get ugly"
"&gt;if I hire an electrician I'm sure they're going to require it.Depends on the electrician.  Many trades are more than happy to bypass permits as there is noone overlooking their work and nitpicking to make them re-do things.  Remember, the permit process is there to protect you, the homeowner, from contractors who cut corners.  I would not skimp on the permit in your case, especially if you're planning on doing it to code anyway (which it sounds like you are).Exact legal requirements will depend on your township, which may be more strict than state code.  I'm not a lawyer or code consultant, but in my experience as long as you have 2 means of egress from a basement (basement stairs and one window) you are covered under most fire codes.  The exact dimensions for the egress will be provided either in your town code, or if none listed there, it would likely be per section 1030 of the NYS fire code, specifically section [1030.5 for window wells](https://up.codes/viewer/new_york/ifc-2015/chapter/10/means-of-egress#1030.5).I'm not sure where you got the 20""x24"" dimension from, per the NYS fire code the minimum requirement is 9 square feet of open space.  A ladder would be an acceptable means of egress, provided it is to an adequately sized opening space.

Otherwise you're overpaying for automation (and frankly, even if you're automating, there are cheaper ways). Do this:1.) Go snag an RGBW light strip. NOT RGB. NOT W. Get the full RGBW strip. Spring for waterproof (like an extra $1 for 6 meters worth of waterproofing. You want the color because...well...why not (blue light at night is easy on the eyes for midnight snacks). You want the ""W"" because it provides a brilliant light that combining RGB wavelengths together doesn't reproduce well.2.) Go figure out what connectors you need, and buy them. They have kits, or individual parts. Strips do NOT do anything but go straight, so if you need any angles, you need a connector. Either get a  right-angle connector, or you can get a wire connector.  While you're at it, get a spool of wire too. Easiest if you just get the ""Customers also searched for..."" thing on amazon of the cable with 5 wires stuck together. Also - shrink tubing. You'll need it. Don't forget the little mounting clips. Get twice as many as you think you'll need.3.) Now, at this point, you could be done. Most rolls of lights come with a power supply, controller, and remote. Alternatively, you can get fancy. Look up ""H-801 RGBW"" on amazon or Aliexpress, and get one. You can use it as-is and I think it works with alexa. You can also hack it to work readily with a home automation system (Tasmota and Espurna - although there's a modest learning curve). You may also want to look into ways to control it with a discretely mounted button or lightswitch. I spring for automation because I like to have them turn on automatically at midnight, and off at sunrise. Total cost: Less than $50. Super easy to install. - $15 for the roll of lights. Cheaper if you look past Amazon. $15 should get you the remote and the power supply though- $10-20 for all the clips and parts, depending on where you shop and how fast you need it.- $10 for the optional controller (H-801)"
"&gt;Regarding tack strips with a product like this - I am concerned that there is a chance the tacks could eventually wear through the carpet backing and become dangerous. Is that an issue?Only with thin, cheap carpets, or looking at 15+ yrs in the future if you're talking a decent quality carpet. At which point if the tack strip spikes are still bugging you, tap them down a little with a hammer.&gt;So regarding height - My backer board + tile is 5/8"". I figure thinset could add another 1/8"" giving me a final height of 3/4"" for the tile. My carpet pad is 1/2"" thick though, so while the top of the pile will be above the tile at this height, I am concerned I will have height issues if I use this L bar method.The carpet tucks in behind the tack strips and up to the bar. Honestly, there's minimal noticeable height issues in this instance - it's usually installs where people are having to reinforce their subfloor (add 1/2-3/4"") + CBU (add 1/4"") + thick porcelain tile (add nearly 1/2"") + using a large notch because of large format tile (add 1/4"") where height issues become apparent (I've seen nearly an inch difference between finished tile height and carpet height in some cases). Carpet being marginally higher definitely won't be noticeable.&gt;Finally, I don't have a carpet kicker, but my carpet is already installed except for the section near the closet which we gently uninstalled. Do I really need to go buy a knee kicker? Or can I get away with stretching the carpet back over the tack strips by hand?If the carpet layer was good, they would've temped off (with nails) just before the doorway so as to allow you to easily re-fit after the fact. That they haven't means that the backing has proper tension everywhere but the doorway. Go rent a kneekicker or power stretcher - unfortunately you'll probably find in 2-3 years time that it'll need restretched at that doorway because of the current situation anyway (if carpet relaxes out too much at any given point you'll start seeing ridges/bubbles, which causes it to get worn significantly faster.. in this situation it's lost tension down the middle but it's not a constant so it's kind of a weird situation for re-stretching especially if it's been left that way for very long). As far as stretching by hand, nope, you just can't hold the tension properly. I mean, *yes you can do it* [poorly], but *no you shouldn't* [because of concerns of how long your carpet will end up lasting from not doing it properly].Sorry for the delayed response, I've been out most of the weekend."
"&gt; They are a very well known name in the lighting industry so it is their name that mattersHaving good QC is definitely a good thing, especially when you want to install something you know will work and not do testing like me. But they don't manufacture their own chips, and no QC is perfect, so you would want to ensure the actual manufacturer uses quality components from the beginning. &gt; If you know of a higher CRI, let me know. 90+ CRIs are mostly reserved for things like office lights and recessed lights. The one you have doesn't even have anything listed. I don't know of any strip lights with &gt;85 CRI either. But I'm not the one that claimed they have are ""high CRI"" for a reason.&gt; The one you have doesn't even have anything listed. More than the CRI, for strip lights it's important that they are consistent. These are consistent.Right, which is why I just have them draped over a window for now, before installing anything. I'd rather test with my own eyes than pay 10x for the same components. I am happy risking $10 when I stand to save $120 and doing some testing myself.&gt;  American company since 1984 and a lot of their products are assembled in the US. I'm sure there is probably Chinese things in there too but that's a lot different than having the entire thing be made and shipped from out of states. Do you even know who assembled your light?No, I don't know them personally. Do you know who manufactures yours? The strips you recommended earlier are 100% made in china too. It seems strange that you would talk up the benefits of made in america while you are recommending chinese lights. Are you succumbing to their marketing again?&gt; UL Listing stands for Underwriters Laboratory. It's not a ""marketing"" term as you claim and is a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory that the NEC requires your fixtures to be listed as.I work for a manufacturer with UL tested products. Our products are safe whether we pay $50k+ for an outside lab to validate our claims or not. When our strips are rolling off the assembly line, they're all safe whether they go to a company that paid for the UL certificate or not. But as I'm sure you can tell, I prefer to do my own research, know what components went into the products I am buying, and validate them myself. &gt; They have some that are 5w/foot as well for longer runs. Maybe they know something you don't?No, I know something you don't. The 5w/ft strips look like the use the SMD5630 chip, which are 0.5w each. You can tell the difference because the 5050's are square and the ones on the 5w/ft are clearly rectangular. &gt; don't even want to consider advice from someone who actually installs and automates these things so sometimes the best way to learn is to try. I especially am dying to know how they dim.I am bothered by how you claim to be more knowledgeable while you are exhibiting some clear misunderstandings of the products you sell. If you had advice that I didn't know was false/misleading, I would gladly listen to it. Even a cursory glance at my history would show how eager I am to learn more and admit that I am wrong or lacking in knowledge whenever possible. I am going to test out the dimming now - you are right that that's an important thing to test. I'll take a video and share what I find. "

"A good scraper and caulk gun and you shouldn't gave too much trouble silicone or not.. and yes mineral spirits or some acetone dipped q tips to get rid of the excess. Also, do this asap. Should be at tops a one hour job scraping tub and toilet and recaulking. "
"A wider shot might help. Judging on that third pic I'd get a piece of your wood trim and scribe it to the space. Even if that means it's only 1/4"" at the bottom. Then glue it in place with maybe a couple nails to hold it. Then caulk the transition to the tile."
"Adding any barrier isn't necessary for wood subfloor, but is an option if you want it for sound reduction or a softer feeling floor.  Cork underlayment does the trick.  As for the floor molding that is totally up to you whether you are satisfied with the look."
"Are you being vague with what you want done?  In my experience, when contractors are met with a lack of specificity, they just increase the bid. Also, he may just not even want the job. Thatü__s another contractor move - to overbid rather than say ü__noü__. "
"As it turns out, it seems that I have a faulty cable in the wall. Can't negotiate a gigabit connection, and it keeps falling back to 100.I might just need to pull a new cable, and if I'm going to do that I might as well try to pull two. Thanks for your help!"
"Build the perpendicular form right to the wall. Use the wall as a form but use some poly sheet to keep the moisture away from the drywall and then pull it out once cured and clear caulk the gap. If you want the continuous counter top, thatü__s how Iü__d do it."
"Could also just be mouse urine and feces left behind. When it gets wet or even just humid, it will smell.  Sealing it in only masks the problem, but it may help.To fix it, you really need to remove any dead animals, and all areas affected by urine and feces."
"Definitely started with that. Actually you reminded me that this happened a week before this problem and this fixed it.I'm more concerned that the one sensor's light never comes on, no matter what. I've read that one should be green and one should be orange."
"Friend of mine has one, and won't use it because it does not get his clothes clean.  Granted, he works in construction, so that has something to do with it.  But he was unsatisfied from the first time he used it.  Now it just hangs on his wall collecting dust."
"Got that exact kit years ago with the older batteries, it works great but that angle grinder chews through some juice when you use it! I now use an adapter for the new batteries and itü__s all good stuff. You can augment it with single purchases on Amazon too."
"Here are some things to consider https://www.thompson-morgan.com/heating-greenhouses-over-winterAlong with heat, you'll need airflow for proper heating. Bubble wrap insulation.Floor mat heaters are a possibility especially if you can run them off of solar."
"House wrap is unnecessary here. Yes, the coil.nails will need bought. They come in a roll of maybe 100 per roll or so. But I suggest them because they have wide, flat heads. Perfect for siding applications and would make your job about a thousand times easier."
"Husband sells appliances, jenn air is his top brand. Yes it is replaceable. He said itü__s a pain so a technician might be the best bet. But itü__s great fridge and definitely worth replacing. He said the fridge will last 20 years. Fix it but have a pro do it."
"I actually did know that, just forgot in the heat of the moment. Itü__s honestly not even that big of a mark but heü__s making such a huge deal about it since itü__s basically a brand new place. So of course I grabbed the magic eraser and then went oh shit lol"
"I am renovating a home built in the 20s that appeared to have no attic access. It turns out that the exterior attic vent was the access and this was common in the time period. You might want to poke around the vent, I tore mine out and rebuilt it to be hinged."
I donü__t know how old you are but tile can be a very slippery surface too. Iü__m from Florida and youü__d be surprised how many serious injuries come from people slipping on tile coming in from the pool or out of the shower and seriously messing themselves up
"I guess the term ""sub floor"" is subjective. Looking up subfloors for older houses, I see oak floor on joists. That's how my floors are throughout my house. I have oak floors on joists with no sub floor per se. I don't see them as subfloors, they are floors. "
"I hate pedestal sinks. You canü__t store anything on  or underneath them. They are great for tiny bathrooms (especially half baths). But for a bathroom where you need towels, wash clothes, toothbrushes, toothpaste, face wash, lotion, etc. Where do you put it? "
"I installed butcher blocks in my kitchen last year.  They have held up well.  If you oil them properly before installing, they won't absorb any water.  You still can't treat it like marble or metal though.  It's solid wood and adds a nice depth to the kitchen."
"I mean, you might want to clean up animal corpses and such. But really, if you're getting them, you may have other problems that need looking at. If you have no other problems down there, you have no reason to go there regularly. Are you going there regularly?"
"I will give that a try next chance I get. Thank you!EDIT: Looking at ""eyeball"" lights and BR16 bulbs online, I don't think that's actually what it is, but I'm not sure. The small, flat opening of the bulb reminds me more of a GU10, but I don't know for sure."
"I'm running a Nest on a 2 wire gas furnace heat only system. What type of system are you trying to connect? Btw - I just used the suggested wiring  from Nest's page Given it's a HVAC then I'd probably go with one of those, but both should be be to handle it "
"If it is lead based, there are encapsulating primers designed to seal in the lead. I think lead-lok is one brand. Generally, the product is more intended for lead safety but it will also help with your issue. And itü__s never a bad idea to seal that stuff up. "

"Installation means many different things. Floor prep. Furniture moving. Disposal of old carpeting. Sub floor repairs. Transitions. Base moldings.These are all individual factors in installation. This is why good companies come to your house to go a quote. "
Installed mahogany slabs for 450 a pop the other day. Hinged and mortised for the lockset. You have to think that the carpenter is taking on the liability of fucking up your 800 door. Unless you want to pay for the replacement donü__t go for the cheapest guy. 
"Is there a clause in your lease/rental agreement stating how to care for the butcher block because if not, you might be in the clear. You can provide landlord with documentation from counter top suppliers stating that it should be sealed if it's near the sink."
"It is leaking out of the spout. I've been watching videos and reading up on the general process. However, have yet to stumble upon the older style of faucet that I have and quite frankly that made me hesitant to fiddle with it. Much appreciate the response :) "
It should go down when the tool is plugged in if you are measuring the voltage inline with the circuit. Your voltmeter measures the potential difference between two points and when you turn the tool on it completes the path.  Sounds like normal behavior to me.
It sounds to me like your tub cartridges or stems are leaking if it's more than 10 minutes or so after a shower or bath. You might want to try stuffing a rag into the spout which could hold it off for a little while. Other than that get your tub valve rebuilt.
"Keep good habits and donü__t let yourself get lazy. Do the dishes every night like clockwork. Clean the bathroom every week. Vacuum and sweep. When you finally have to live with a partner, you wonü__t have lots of bad habits. Also get renterü__s insurance.  "
"Natural gas has no smell, they add the sulfur ""scent"" so that people will know if there is a gas leak.  If you aren't getting that sulfur smell, you should contact your gas company.  It could be very dangerous if you have a gas leak and can't easily detect it."
"Not sure I follow the scam portion of your statement, but they ""don't care"" about the appreciation? In Atlanta we are talking at least a 10K difference in value with a functional pool. I don't know of anyone who would shake a stick at that much extra value. "
"Not that this matters much in this discussion but you wouldn't send this stuff on a truck across country like that, you'd use freight trains to local distribution center and then truck it for a much shorter distance to the retail store or installation site. "
"People used some pretty nasty chemicals in the past. You are going to need to physically remove all the contaminated wood, which unfortunately also means getting rid of the beautifully worn part. And even then there could be seepage between the pieces of wood."
"Probably, at least a lower end corded model.  But my house has zero outlets outside so corded model wouldn't have helped me.I did think about just buying one, but that was 5 years ago and I've not needed one since so it would just be cluttering up my garage."
"Removal is not really an option. This a brick column on inside, but on outside it has cast concrete ""panels"" done in 1912. Dont know if that is done today..but even if i could find someone, im sure big $$$!But you are right..that would be the best way to go."
"Right, they won't fill it and I just hit 1/4 of a tank...I work for a environmental firm so I know how costly it can be. My previous oil company is willing to fill it, but will call them today to see if they can inspect it and determine if it needs replacing. "
"Safe unless disturbed or broken up.  Totally fine to stay as is on the ceiling. If you want to change the look I would recommend hiring a drywaller to skim the entire ceiling back to flat, rather than scraping popcorn off and releasing asbestos into the air."
Something you might consider as a cheap option is to dig a trench to the side of your driveway and fill it with river rock which is round and decorative.  It will allow the water to drain and should not require a permit as it could be considered landscaping.  
"Thatü__s the primer: http://www.insl-x.com/product-detail/inslx-products/prime-lock-plusThe fan was a cheap model, and wasnü__t installed at the right place. We moved it and replaced it with a Panasonic WhisperCeiling 150CFM. We hope it will fix our problem."
The secondary on any 24v furnace transformer consists of two wires - one goes to the R terminal and the other would be the C wire. The terminal strip where your thermostat wires in may or may not have a C position but the transformer will always have a C wire.
"The traditional method was that some of the perpends in the brick were not mortared, and wood wedges were driven into the the gap.  Then you nailed the baseboard and such to them.  I've just cut out a piece of plaster and attached wood blocks in the place.  "
"These cabinets look very retro and neat! Have you thought about maybe sanding them and give it a white stain that would look like white washed cabinets? Or any other color you want really. Painting cabinets is so hard if you donü__t professionally do it, imho."
"This is an essential part of homeownership. _˘Æ_˘ÆJust don't tell anyone you know how to do it or you will become the family plumber.This is probably the number one reason people call a plumber. Yet is a $15 fix from home depot. Literally plug and play. "
"Update: found out that the Well is indeed on its own dedicated line, so thats not my issue..my cousin said my capacitor was losing charge though. How would I find the make and model of the pump? It was here with the house and I donü__t have any paperwork on it"
"Wait, so the baseboard was intentionally used as a ""clamp""?It is slightly pinched, but not *that* much. But even if I remove the baseboard, how will I reach the end of it? The way I pull it, it isn't stuck because of the baseboard, it's stuck well past that."
"We have those locks and it took all of two weeks before the kids figured out how they worked and how to get them opened.Kid one we baby proofed everything, kid two not much, kid three we had to do a bit more or else we were picking up Ziploc bags every hour."
We installed a couple American Standard Champion 4 Max toilets a few years back after I watched a demonstration at Home Depot where they were flushing buckets of golf balls. I recommend them to everyone. I havenü__t found a butt loaf that they canü__t handle. 
"White is neutral. Red is usually an additional hot; Could be a 3 or 4 way switch leg, could be the hot of a split neutral pair of circuits, could be a hot for a 220V circuit.&amp;#x200B;For your smart switches, you will need a white wire in the switch box."
Why not just unthread the fittings and thread on some black iron or galvanized caps. Then cut the pipes inside with a sawzall. Unless they really bother you. Then unthread fittings and see if you can cut inside and whack through after. Then grout the holes up.
Wood does expand and contract. I have only done this type of heating with tile or other material. I would get a professional to come out and give you a free estimate to know for sure (even if you donü__t use what he offers you can use the advice on what to do)
"Yeah dishwasher is a cabinet away, you think that's bad? Plumbing is no big deal, we're reworking everything, plumbing, electrical etc. Electrical is already redone, plumbing for the most part too.You think the fan should be bigger? Or am I getting it wrong?"
"Yep they let me know it was because the panel was more than 10 feet away from the meter. Follow up question, do you have any suggestions on what I could use the circuit spaced on the new meter box for? Are those mostly reserved for shops and garages and stuff?"
Yes that should've been caulked. All changes of plane and changes of material need a movement joint. Not allowing for it can cause buckled and cracked tiles in addition to cracked grout. See the TCNA guidelines here: https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/52-ej171.html
You did understand digging isn't necessary going to fix the stuck jack?  The stuck jack could possibly be unstuck by squirting a strong stream of water under the jack base in an effort to wash out the dirt squeezed between the base and the top of the concrete.
"You have a golden opportunity to frame that out as a built-in garden shed.  I would level the ground, throw down some interlocking pavers, then use T1-11 siding.  Put a door on one end and you are golden.  A shed window would also be nice to let in some light."
"pretty sure if you looked at 100 industrial buildings with fan ventilation you would find 99 using exhaust fans to change air.Not sure that is a perfect analogy, I assume it is because of turbulence around the fan blade.Any fluid engineers care to comment?"
"yeah, I would agree with the little bit of sourcing I've seen. If you wanted a really rich color, it seems wallpaper was the way to go, probably easier to get deep colors in paper than an applicaple pigment. I feel like it was heavy on yellows, greens, browns."
"At 3 flushes per day thatü__s 0.9 gallons daily savings! Over a year youü__re talking 328.5 gallons of water. Which is a lot! An average bathtub is 80-100 gallons. So imagine filling your tub once per season and then just pouring it down the drain.Water usage does not always equal flushing power. The design of the bowl and outflow channel have a huge impact. My Kohler 1.3 gallon flushes everything like a champ. On the very rare occasions that it doesnü__t, Iü__m only spending 1.3 gallons on that second flush."
"Check the numbers on the bib and look them up. You may be able to see if itü__s frost free. If the plumbing was done in the last few years and itü__s a colder climate it most likely is. If itü__s frost free you turn it off from the outside. I had what I believed was a frost free hose bib at my last house and I still covered it with one of those foam covers from the hardware store just in case. Iü__d had burst pipes two winters in a row in the finished basement due to lack of insulation so I was on guard lol. "
"Definitely clean it up first.  Search this thread for how to clean up mold and youü__ll get a million different answers.  Some say bleach/water combo, but Iü__d google it and find something that more people agree on.  I havenü__t dealt with mold like that before.  Then use dampRID in your closets (and change them out regularly) and maybe run a dehumidifier in your place to keep humidity levels lower.  Check your other closets.Finally make sure there was no outside water getting in that was causing this issue."
"Every home owner must have a set of basic tools.  Even if you don't do much home improvement, these tools are basic needs for fixing minor items and hanging pictures / shelves.

"I am dealing with a problem that sounds similar to yours. Finally  I got an inspection done, and they said they found traces of mold. I'm not certain that's the cause, because there was about 3 other things that was suspected that helped but didn't completely fix the problem.Anyways, it cost $500 for the inspection, and replacing all the drywall and detoxing it is gonna run me $15k.  And I'm not even 100% sure its gonna fix the problem. FMLEDIT: Also, I'm in the bay area, where everything costs like double."
"I definitely think so. We bought our house in June 2018, the water heater was made in August 2017 (10 months old?) and the aluminum rod that was in it was gnarly when I pulled it out to replace it.  I don't think it takes long for well water to eat conventional rods up.I'm not familiar with the effects of hydrogen peroxide on laundry - I know a lot of people suggested that to people who were concerned about using bleach.  I just kept rinsing it out until neither me or my wife could smell the chlorine anymore."
"I don't know the cause of that but I can tell you i had a French drain put in almost 10 years ago and they replaced the same amount of cement on the floor in your picture. We are apparently on top of an underground stream bc ours fills up even when it's not raining and our cement never got wet like that. Is a lot of water getting drained into the sump pit when it rains. If not, maybe they didn't grade the pipes enough and the water coming up when there is a lot of it instead of running down to the sump pit.  "
"Iü__ve lived in the area for nearly 4 decades, so youü__re preaching to the choir! I agree that it can be ridiculous humidity in the summer. My main struggle is that I donü__t know how good air conditioning feels in a house to understand the drawback of just using window/wall units like I have been doing. Maybe Iü__ve just been blessed with a condo thatü__s had good ventilation to offset the downside of the wall units. Might feel a lot different come next summer trying to survive with them in the new house..."
"Just looking at your pics, this issue likely would have occurred even if the wires had been looped. The issue here is due to stress on the wire where the insulation was cut for stripping. Proper wire strippers are gauged properly to avoid nicking and creating a weak spot in the wire which will often result in breakage exactly like this. It's more likely that this issue was caused by either improper use of wire strippers or by using a utility knife to slice through the insulation and scaring the wire underneath."
"No experience, but why isn't filling it in an option?Couldn't you break the pool apart, fill in with dirt, pack it down and move on? The only thing I would think as a limiting factor would be the pool acting like a bowl and keeping water in. I live in TN and the rocks here more or less make a basin under the soil. Logic would make me think that as long as there was a place for the water to go and it wasn't all caught that you should be ok. This isn't to say that it would be a monumental pain in the ass to do."
"Possibly those shitty ones that come with light fixtures, not wago. I've heard things about lever wagos, but electricians can tape those closed. So many reasons to choose them over wire nuts. Sparkies in other countries are liking them. Other countries also do a lot more products that have terminals within them. I kinda like that, too. You know, fixtures and boxes with little terminal bars with lug screws  in themI'm older now, so I can see my wrists or hands  feeling a long day of wire nutting if I had to."
"Potentially, yes. It really all depends on the severity. If itü__s just got some surface mold or mildew that you can scrape and paint over, sure. But if itü__s actually eating away at the wood, Iü__d certainly recommend replacing it. Maybe pull the cabinet and stick your phone in the hole and take a picture aiming straight down. Thatü__ll help. And if the sheetrock is the source of the smell thereü__s really no way to paint the back of sheetrock with it installed so youü__d be ripping out and replacing anyways."
"So Iü__m no designer but a piece of advice I got when I did my deck that had a one step up raised area was to make the boards go opposite direction. So where your table is should be going perpendicular to the other lower platforms. Reason being is your eye will catch the difference and keep you from tripping over it. That make sense? I did that and havenü__t had anyone stumble yet. Also, ipe is on my list for next house. I did trex on current deck and was decent but I think ipe is how I want to go next time. "
"Yeah, I have been using YouTube, but then I didn't have the confidence in my own measuring skills, so I started following directions to build the wall in place, and couldn't find a video on placing a door with such a method, so I started improvising. It's actually coming along really well, other than this little hiccup, which is now corrected. Regarding the screws, an experienced friend suggested I use screws because he likes them better, and actually worked out because i had to back them out to fix the doors. "

"You're supposed to have an annual inspection and professional cleaning, which is around $300. If anything happens to the system - failed inverter, failed/broken panel, bad wiring etc the leasing company is responsible. The micro inverters on each panel (assuming it's not a central inverter) have around a 20 year warranty, and when they start going bad you're looking at $600 a pop. On a 30 year old system, you could be replacing a lot of expensive equipment on a system that has lost 20% of its output capability."
"I don't have any advice for you on getting them out, but you're not alone. Our house was built in 1913, and so far we've encountered:a) a couch that's been in one room on the second floor since the 70s? I think. Not sure how they got it in, since it was too wide for the door and the window. It had to be rolled from one side of the room to the other to vacuum. We took a Sawzall to it and tossed the pieces through the window.B) we can't fit a queen size box spring up the stairs to the second floor. Staircase is enclosed and too narrow. Who thought that was a good idea? Moving a new stove into the upstairs kitchen was a nightmare.On the topic of appliances, AJMadison is great. Bought a fridge/stove/dishwasher set through them some years ago, they were great. "
"I gotta back this up with some philosophical logic. OP, if your safety is anyoneü__s responsibility, itü__s yours. Nobody else has to live in your body for the rest of your life. Expecting others to adequately protect your health is naive at best. Now, the comment Iü__m responding to proposed a plan that sounds like some hard work. But it seems like itü__s worth doing as long as you can advocate for yourself well to your superiors depending on what you find. If you are concerned about it, do some good research (research that considers the qualifications of sources) and try to find out exactly how those particular chemicals may be safely handled. IF you find your job isnü__t doing what it should, youü__ll have sound reasons for whatever actions you elect to take."
"The stud part is the bit that scares me. I know how to find them, but I'm always second-guessing myself.  I know that I'll run out of space quickly (I'm downsizing a ton and will probably do so more when I get settled). This house has room to build outwards, but that's a project for the future when I've got a better job. I'm just thinking that since I don't have a ton of clothes that maybe that extra closet would be better suited to holding books and things. I'd also like to use it to convert the half bath into a full bath since it's right on the other side of it, but I've been told that it may be hard since it's a slab foundation. That'll also be a project for the future though, I'm sure I'll have my hands full in the mean time before I start anything big."
"Walk around outside and try to pry windows, doors etc open with hands. Try the credit card in the doors or window seals. Test out how weak it is to see what you are dealing with. Better to know before you move in your valuables. Ask if they warn you before entering apartment for maintenance or anything ahead of time. Check out the parking lot at night. See how well all is lit up. Plan safe pathing to and from car, garbage bin etc. Cheap socket tester from a hardware store can be helpful. Check all the outlets for issues before you start plugging in all you equipment and appliances. Check the stove eyes and inside elements, cheap thermostat inside freezer. Make sure washer and dryer work if they are inside the apartment. Check faucets for cold and hot water. "
"Just get two couplings and a about a foot of pipe and replace the portion with the hole. Dig out about a foot on each side of the leak. Put the grass on one side of the hole and dirt on the other so when youü__ve finished the repair itü__s easy to fill the hole back in and return grass to original state. Cut out the bad portion and glue on the first coupling to the pipe in the ground. Measure how far the distance is from coupling to the next piece of pipe. REMEMBER!!!! The pipe needs to go to the mid point of the coupling not just touch the front, it need to go inside to be glued properly. If you do this all the same time while the glue is still wet you can do what I_ˆè like to call ü__a poor manü__s slipfixü_ù cause you can pop that pipe right on it. The 2 foot hole makes it where you can bend the pipe a little easier without running the risk of shattering it. The space depends on the size of the pipe. 1/2ü_ù pipe will bend  more than 1ü_ù pipe so you need a bigger hole as the pipe diameter increases. "
"They weigh, what, 2000lb?  Each tire has maybe 4x(5x2)=40 sqin contact area leaving you 2000/40=50psi of pressure from the car. To put that into perspective concrete has a low end pressure rating of 3000psi (assuming a few inch thick slab). I'm not familiar with wood strength, but I was finding tons of species with a compression pressure around 5000psi +/-1000psi (no thickness given, i assume freshly cut new wood). Seems high to me. So even if you take an eighth of that value on the low end you get a safety factor of 500/50=10. At least in the aviation tooling world, that's good. I would worry too much about the steel columns they are designed for that. The beams and joists look somewhat decent. That hole in the floor, and surrounding wood needs to be covered with at least 3/4 plywood. When you cover that spot up, the converting needs to be supported by the ground. Idk man, seems like it's possible. What you want to do is spread it the weight as much as possible. You don't want to point load and bad pieces of wood. You need good wood over the bad wood. Replace what you can and cover if it isn't already.compression pressure is only a small part of the overall equation. There are tons of things to looks at like bending, cantilever loading, rotted areas, etc."
"Yes, I prefer to be technically and realistically correct instead of just legally or bureaucratically correct.  ""Meets all codes"" isn't always good enough. &gt; If you have a fire and your insurance company finds out you have thirty year old smoke detectors you're in for a world of hurt.  Unlikely, especially because those old detectors only supplement my modern, meets-all-current-codes fire alarm system with all the interconnected smoke detectors.  I like them because they buzz instead of give off high-pitched whistles, meaning they're more likely to be noticed, especially when I'm sleeping.  And my insurance company will probably like the fact that our house also has a modern, meets-all-current-codes fire sprinkler system, even though I don't live in Scottsdale.   &gt; Then why did you mention it? It's irrelevant.  To indicate how old they were.  Before the 1990s a lot of common products were manufactured in the USA.  Also I know a person who worked for the manufacturer with that particular model smoke detector and might have had more expertise with it than anyone who wasn't an engineer or scientist.  Anybody who thought I was doing a ""rah rah USA!"" seems like the kind of person who jumps to conclusions too quickly and doesn't know how to read people.  "
"The cabinets are just their standard brown base cabinets.  The doors I forget the names of(fancy Swedish shit), but the dark brown wood look for the base cabinet doors, and the gloss turquoise for the uppers.  They have quite a few different styles and the prices vary from as little as $30 per door to $150 per door I think.  Most of it is just really nice laminated particle board, and some of it is wood and has glass built in.  Its really worth it to check their showrooms out.  The current stores basically have thousands of sq feet of kitchen after kitchen to showcase different styles, and usually right after their kitchens you can look at the price of everything.  Their kitchen designer on their website is also useful since you can put in your kitchen dimensions, including doors, windows, etc, and then build a 3d model of the whole kitchen using exactly the cabinets they sell.  Then it can work up a complete parts list for you including the price.  In the store they go over your design, confirm a few things, make any changes, point out anything you may have forgotten, then pull the entire materials list for you so an hour later you take a big cart that has your whole kitchen to your car.  And if you get stone countertops, they schedule for a local countertop company to measure your kitchen once you're done setting it up, and come and install it for much cheaper than the local companies can normally do it for.I know there are companies out there who you can have do other style doors that work perfectly with Ikea's cabinet system and hinges, but they tend to be pricier.Ikea is just probably your best bang for your buck cabinets you can get.  They are absolutely not the nicest thing out there, and there are a lot of limitations to them so they have some limitations with customizing anything or complicated situations.  But the are easy to put together and install, they have a pretty good style as long as you like ""contemporary"" and you absolutely cannot get a comparable set up at the same price from any other brand."

Left enough room for expansion. At the time I thought it mightü__ve been too much but it had been a warm September and the floor has been shrinking since itü__s been getting cold. The hollowness and squishiness feels below the vinyl flooring more than anything.

"Geez,  my phone never showed anybody messaged me besides the first.  And yes the house is super cool _˘Æ_˘Æ I'm truth it's not my house but my parents.  We live in WI and the house sits alone on top of a hill looking out over the city.  Was built by an engineer who lived there. All concrete with wood beams throughout and huge windows.  They're thinking about building a platform above the pool for the hot tub too. We had the pool guys over and said beside sealing the cracks and repainting should be good to go.  "
"I live in an area where you only have grass if you make it by having irrigation. Weeds are not a problem here. This is what I found regarding the dirt. ""Debris and dirt can ""muddy"" up the look of the mulch fairly quickly. Be prepared to blow out leaves and debris and to hose down the mulch regularly to keep the colors looking fresh and vibrant. The good news is that the colors tend to not fade as quickly as wood mulch, so although the investment is high, you should have vibrant colors for many seasons to come."""
"I see what youü__re saying and you are probably correct that an FHA title 1 loan will offer the lowest interest rate. However, FHA loans and mortgages have a lot of fees &amp; expenses, such as PMI. These fees may exceed the interest rate savings, because you are borrowing a modest sum. Getting an interest rate 2% lower is not such a big deal when your only borrowing 15,000 for a few years. Follow me? Obviously, you will need to sit down with a banker, see what they can off &amp; crunch some numbers. Good luck. "

"It seems like the vapor barrier is your main question. I just had a construction project finished where the builders put up a breathable vapor barrier. That might alleviate some of your concerns about mold/humidity. Just curious, how do you heat the place? With no more insulation than the drywall/physical wood you've gotta wonder how much savings there could be if you insulate properly. Are there tax breaks/government incentives in Canada for improving the thermal performance of your house? Worth looking into."
"It's fine to put them on top. However, you do need a physical connection between the rafters and the ledger board. If ugly is okay, hurricane ties fit the bill. Otherwise, I would look at either doing toenails with some deck screws (drill holes in the rafters), or if you are doing 4x4 posts, drill from the top and use simpson strong-drive screws. You might also consider doubling the header; I had to do that on a similar project so there was enough surface for the rafters (well, purlins, actually) to sit on.

"Its unique in that my in-laws are going to live in the basement. The house came with a 3 car so we actually made it 4 bays. 2+2. [Link.](https://i.imgur.com/xsyr7ly.jpg) [Plan pic.](https://i.imgur.com/0Q0nM0B.jpg) Pardon the drawing on that last one I was sending the info to my builder on a deck. So the plan is to have 3 cars in the garage and I get the deep 3rd bay.  It works out because of the entry on the wide door which allows the house to look fairly normal.[Front View](https://i.imgur.com/KcXaRgf.jpg)"

"Mount an external 'frame' of studs and/or plywood secured to the room side of the drywall with many drywall anchors (thinking at 4, maybe 5 for just the top piece, are you also getting the tire tray?) and with glue if you can for more holding power.  Attach the rack to the framing (i.e. directly into the wood).Don't use those drywall anchors, they won't work well for this as they are better for static loads (hanging a heavy pic and leaving it for a few years).

"Our sump pump used to go to a floor drain and then to the septic.  We had that corrected to meet code for connecting to city sewer.  With this I have been looking at sump pump information a bit lately, but am no expert.  If this is in an area that is prone to regular freezes, the information that I have been finding encourages an air gap in this section of the pipe to prevent water from freezing in the pipe gradually over the winter and causing a backup into the house late in the season as you get more thaws.

"Sometimes with allergies you have to medicate and never open your windows during your bad season.  That was the story of my life until I got allergy shots.  An allergist would say to not have your dog in your room.  Do you have central air/furnace?  Add a better filter to it, or add a filter to your vent.  Air purifiers are expensive to purchase and maintain.  For what it is worth, you will never get rid of all the dust in a room.  Also find out what you are allergic to- is it dust, dog, pollen, mold, grasses?  "
"Sweet as. It's against code here to use timber as a hob, as it has a tendancy to warp and split the waterproofing. Did they use a bandage with the redgard?

I make a living re doing bathrooms and leaking showers and if yours was done professionally you have some comeback if there's any issues but it's easier to directly talk to the homeowner if they diy-ed. If there's no problems in the first few months chances are there won't be any. "
"Thank you for the input! I have a couple of portable ones that I typically put out in the winter, but they're a pain to always be refilling and walking around. And I assume that with them always running their little fan, they use more electricity than a whole home unit that just operates passively when the furnace runs.This might sound stupid, but what about putting a humidifier unit in the (conditioned, upstairs) room where my return air gets sucked in? Would that distribute the humidity throughout the house?"

"The most altitude is to put the mount over my siding using a ladder.. as opposed to putting the mount adjacent to the garage window. Again, you can't just jump up onto the garage window, but I wanted to mount it above the window where you'd clearly need a ladder to take my light down.And that's what I prefer...if using the mount onto the siding is a viable option. When you referenced going ""through the siding into the structure"", I didn't know what that meant and I started to think I wouldn't be able to do it."

"unfortunately if it impacts life/safety (plumbing. electrical, HVAC)  and the code requires permits, then it is clearly not just your business. Again, a code inspector could require complete removal or you face having your house condemn and rendered unfit for occupancy. It can happen and has happened.  Usually a disgruntled neighbor or family member makes a report to building department and if a code official knocks on your door, you can refuse entry but  the shit hits the fan when they come back with a warrant."

"Get a small, used miter saw on Craigslist if you are on a budget. We use ours for a ton of projects. If you don't have a nail gun, borrow one or craigslist.

Snow shoveling is something that may be required by state law for landlords to provide, and to get out of it they put it in your lease for you to do it. And finally know your state laws. There are things that landlords are required to do. There are things they arenü__t. And there are things they are required to do that no one ever does."
"I could see the concern of opening the wall if the washer/dryer are opposite of it. That's more of a personal design choice. It could work fine, or look a little funky. That would depend on how that area looks, if it blends well enough into that space that it would look natural being that open. I would imagine having white painted solid pantry doors covering it would make it blend and look fine. Having solid doors in a tight laundry closet may necessitate added ventilation in there somehow. That's just a guess though and may be unnecessary to point out if it's already set up that wayPersonally that layout would feel better to me. Especially since it pulls the stove away from the rest of the cabinets as well. Then you have more room to move around while cooking."
"I second the dual duct portable. I think the problem with single duct units is that they're sucking the very air that they've cooled out of the room and spitting it out the window. A dual duct system exhausts air that it drew in from outside.&gt; I've heard rumors of Asian/European ""through-the-wall"" units that carve only a small slit in the outside wall.You may mean Ductless Mini Split systems? They have an outside unit, an inside unit, and are connected by refrigerant lines running through the wall.&gt; Someone else was also telling me about a unit that is buried in the ground outside but through which air can be brought into the apartment through a small pipe?You may mean a Ground Coupled Heat Exchanger, which cost many thousands of dollars to install."
"It's relatively easy although it does take a bit of work.- anything that simply says ""Mr. Former Homeowner"", cross out any barcode on the bottom and write ""RETURN TO SENDER"" next to the address. Drop it in a mailbox.- any mail that says ""Mr. Former Homeowner *or current resident*"" the post office will not help you with. They will not forward or return it. Generally this is catalogs and other ads. Call the businesses and asked to be removed from their list. Most catalog companies send out mailings every month or so, so you will have to do this for a month before you really notice a decline.- Put your last name / names on your mailbox (put it inside if you don't want it publicly visible).

LMFAO. I realize you need a little extra concrete for rat walls etc. for a garage, but typically it's around $5 per sq ft. I had a similar quote for $4000 for a garage slab.  Concrete alone itself is even WAY cheaper. I built my own garage, with roof and windows. And the total cost of building materials was $2000-3000. No where near $15,000. Although I didn't do dry wall and insulation (which are cheap as well).  And I bought a cheaper garage door. But let's say I had a premium door? It would have maxed out at $6000. You can buy a house here for $75K. &amp;#x200B;"
"I know myself. I'm not going to do it. I saw what they were doing. I'm happy to have it done by people doing it every day and doing it right. I have a job that I feel like anyone can do given enough time and effort as well, and frankly, that's how I learned to do it, but I go to work every day to get paid to do that job because the other people where I work want to do THEIR work without spending hours figuring out the mundane parts of my job that I do. I'm happy to leave some things to professionals. Others, no so much. e.g. $1200 quote to replace my hot water heater. I know I can buy one cheaper and get a guy from work to do it for a lot less. I'll probably do exactly that. Nevertheless, I hear ya. I know that it can be done for a fraction of the cost, but I also know if I get a crew of people that do it every day as opposed to me doing it once, they've already gone through trial and error of dumb mistake I'll make and spend months doing on something they can knock out in a few days. I'm actually fine with that."
"PEX is taking over. Plumbers bidding a copper job will be outbid by plumbers bidding PEX. It's cheaper and easier to run. Coupling with copper and copper alloys is routine.Having said that, thick copper has a longer history of withstanding the test of time if properly installed and protected from freezing. The copper failures I see are thin walled shit, bursts from freezing, galvanic corrosion. I don't live where it's an issue, but supposedly alkaline or acidic water will shorten the life of copper.Maybe I'll share images later today, my only case of chewed through PEX.  Didn't think it could be a thing until I saw it with my own eyes. Probably rare. Past PEX failures were related to failed fittings and earliest chemistries. PEX cannot be installed where it will be exposed to UV. It can make more noise with temp changes than copper, because it has an amazing coefficient of expansion. You know, when you turn on hot water, and you hear it sliding through things. A thing with copper, more of a thing with PEX."
"You just have to manually trace them to find the most upstream one. Simplest way to do that is to start closest to the panel and (with the breaker off, obviously), remove the load side from the outlet and see what stops working. It'll take time, but you should be able to figure out the placement/sequence.No alternative I know of. GFI is already a less-than-perfect/ideal solution to a common problem. Ideally, all outlets would be both grounded and GFI-protected. But you can (literally) live without the former if you have the latter. But you still risk damage to equipment. That's why the ""No equipment ground"" labels are still required. A GFI will save your life, but they will not save your device from damage.Having whole-house surge protection does matter insofar as it'll prevent surges from outside your home. But not from those that originate from inside. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGpOwUAJ16c*Random guy who always shows up in here to comment anytime someone even thinks of the word ""surge"" in 3...2...1...*Yeah, that's tough when you have walls like that. My basement was recently finished, but with full size studs (not just furring), so GFIs can be accommodated. My suggestion would be, first, see if you can find an upstream outlet on another wall that has more room and put a GFI there. Or, if necessary, install a surface-mount box for the GFI. Not as attractive, but gets the job done.Also, you always have the option of installing a GFI breaker to protect the entire circuit from the panel itself. Cheers."

"&gt; Basement is unfinishedThen you'd definitely want some insulation, though being a renter, it probably wouldn't make sense for you to pay for it. But it makes sense that the landlord wouldn't be motivated to fix it - they're not the one paying for the heat!"
"&gt; If i nix the painters tape (I have tons of it, i do alot of painting projects) and just got double sided tape would that be better?It might.  If the painters tape is working and you lots of it, I'd stick with that until you see evidence of it NOT working."

"&gt; So the T &amp; G cedar is attached to a solid wood door?...yes? I think so. Well as solid as plywood and pine are. It must weight a ton. 16'x7'ish with all that wood. Original to the 1979 house, as is the Craftsman opener, though it's on its last legs. "
A ceiling forced air heater like a stelpro dragon is a good option. I changed my 4000w shop heater in my 25x25 workshop 2 winters ago and I noticed a big difference on general confort in the shop (I like to work in T shirt) and a big  $$$ efficiency difference. 
"Agree with this 100% Also, since your new deck is PT pine, youü__re better off waiting the 3+ months youü__ve already done or wait until next spring anyway. Half the PT pine I see lately is so damn wet and needs at least 6 months to dry before Iü__d stain it. "

"Ah, gotcha. Yeah those terms get thrown around a lot willy nilly. I should know. I do it all the time. ;-)I'm not even sure what I have is called ""BX"". In fact, I believe BX is a specific brand that just started getting used colloquially? Can't recall. Cheers."
"But would that tell me how much heat things are dumping into the room? I already know the water lines are essentially the same temperature as the water, and that the furnace case is warm, but don't know how much heat overall they are each dumping into the room. "
Call the management office back. Tell them the dehumidifier is growing mold and all residents are experiencing increased illness. You also may want to look up renters rights in your area so that you're knowledgeable in the event that you need to break the lease.

"I can feel the cold coming in from the area of the door, so that's just where I'm starting to think, besides a heater. I know just having a heater will help, but looking to not rocket the electronic bill. Would be nice to really keep the heat in. Haha! No waste."

I put an outlet behind a tv and needed a 90 degree cord in order to fit.... i just went to walmart and bought [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GE-Pro-Designer-Extension-Cord-8ft-Braided-Cord-with-Flat-Plug-3-Outlets-Gray-and-White-38598/60319710) and it worked.
"I would seal it. Either purchase a cap or a piece of flat duct and screw it in place or seal it with foil tape. It wouldnt be providing enough residual heat to be protecting pipes and warm air rises, not sinks so its not left for any purpose that I can imagine. "
I'm sure it varies by municipality. Few building codes are nation or even state wide. Where I am it's window or vent. My house (1957) did not have fans in either. We just installed one in the full bath but it has to go on with the light because of how its wired.
If you do it by yourself Iü__m going to recommend taking off a wooden handle of a broom or rake or whatever and tape it to the end of your tube where the insulation is blown out. Really helps you to move it into far away places that might be a pain to climb to. 
"If you have plenty of counter space, you could get a [countertop dishwasher](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=countertop+dishwasher).  It doesn't hold as much as a regular dishwasher, but it's better than nothing."

"It looks great but I totally agree with you. I also however have an unremodeled kitchen that thus has open shelving ( a metal pantry unit) by necessity so I've gotten to learn that by experience. Those who haven't lived with it, make the choice from aesthetics. "

"Iü__m not sure of your location, but some cities have tool libraries (e.g. The Denver Tool Library). For a very reasonable annual membership - less than one 4 hour rental from HD- you can check out any tool you need, including a hammer drill.  Best service ever!"
Just stopping back by because I was curious how this worked out. Hopefully the solution is ü__I gave up on caulking thisü_ù because if thereü__s water above where youü__re caulking it really doesnü__t belong there and needs to be given a way to drain downwards. 
"Like I said, it's certainly a good idea to add it on it's own breaker especially if you dont know what else is on it, I'm not arguing against that.My only issue with what the poster above said is that it would be against code to put them on the same breaker.  "
"Maybe a redundant question, so don't take it the wrong way...But are you sure they're not T25 screws? I don't think any of my Spax longer than 1.5 - 2"" are T20. Most are T25.Did you try the bit that comes with the screws? Spax tosses in a bit into every box."
One more point: pros do taping in very thin coats so there is less need for sanding. They are better at this than we DIYers. You really shouldnü__t need to use a power sander. Watch several youtube videos to see how thin and smooth their work is before sanding. 
"Search every where for the shutoff. Start from outside, find where the pipe goes into the house if you can. If you don't have one, get a plumber to install a shut off valve some where it makes sense. Once you have a shutoff, then you can try to isolate the leak."
Seconding the Ecobee. I replaced an old thermostat with the Ecobee and itü__s been great. Support was also awesome when I neglected to hook up correct. So far itü__s been great and my utility company gave an instant $75 rebate when purchased directly from them. 
"So your counterpoint is: Because *you* find framing easy all roofers should be expected to be proficient in it, know the applicable codes and carry the appropriate tools (like a radial arm saw), *all* of which is outside of what their job is 99.9% of the time?  "
"Sorry about the misunderstanding. The picture is just for reference of ""3"" wires into the light switch.&amp;#x200B;My current set up I have at home in question has a ground, black and white and no other wires nut that seems to be connecting to anything else."
"The few I looked at seemed to be rip offs. One wanted a raise in rates of 5% every year.  Even my ü__greedyü_ù utility doesnü__t get an increase like that. Plus they only put panels good for 30-50% of your energy usage the rest has to come from the utility. "
The soil or rock will keep washing away. Or as the roots rot more erosion. Goal is to plug it then place dirt of top. Concrete from what read al works. Messy and heavy. The foam I bought came in small bags. It states each bag is equal to 2 fifty lbs of concrete.
The vacation mode will keep the water tank above freezing. If you want to turn off the water main then you need to turn off the water heater. It is a good Idea to turn off the water when vacant to keep vandals from opening an outside spigot and leave it running.
"This is not helpful to anyone.  From the right side of this sub:***Comments must be on-topic, helpful, and kind. Abusive or hateful language is not tolerated, nor are disrespectful, personal comments.***If you cannot be helpful, please do not respond at all."
"This might be a little more work than youü__re willing to do, but how about removing any box in the wall, trimming the wires back, and just patching the hole with a small piece of drywall and spackling/painting over it like you would any other hole in the wall.?"
"Totally understandable. I'm not sure I'd be excited to do it again either. Tough work and not super pleasant. I wouldn't have had to budget to pay someone, so I made it work. Either way, air seal and attic insulation is a well worth it project by any measure"
We wanted to do top-down because there is a pattern in the top corner that aligns vertical pieces with the top horizontal section (and we are so not skilled enough to do the accurate measurements to estimate length plus spacers to ensure it aligns at the top).  
"Well it's definitely older than that. It's probably been there since the house was built, which was over ten years ago. I know it's good and dead, but replacing/straight up getting rid of it are off the table, so I was hoping this might make the color bearable. "
Where are you located? Iü__m in Central Illinois. I have electric pipe tape on my plumbing the crawl space. This is what was in use before I bought the house. Iü__ve been measuring the temps in that area and Iü__m happy with he results of sealing and insulating.
"Which impact are you using? My 20v impact driver from Dewalt has no torque setting - just forward and reverse. Dewalt makes a 1/2"" drive impact meant for removing bolts that has a torque setting - if that's what you are using, no wonder you are breaking bits!!"
You can get some silicone and put stripes on the underside of the rug to make a non slip rug. It won't damage your floors.  (I don't mean you should glue it to the floor. I mean you should allow the silicone to dry before putting the silicone down on the floor.)
"https://www.hometips.com/how-it-works/standard-light-switch-wiring.htmlIn your scenario, they simply used 14-2 but neglected to color the white wire black. It is a simple circuit, so most electricians ignore the white wire being used as a line/ load conductor."
"i'm having this same problem after living in the house 3+ years, I'm still getting mail for the old couple that used to live here.  I have been nice about keeping it an giving it to the neighbor who knows where they live now in a nursing home about 2 miles away."
is it a supply duct (blows air when the HVAC runs)? or a return (sucks air)? If neither cap it for sure it will be a draft producer. If its either a supply or return that is sucking air from or blowing air into an unfinished crawlspace it should also be capped. 
"oh sorry, its the vinyl that clicks together.  they are removing the carpeting/laminate, and moving some furniture, but otherwise no other service.  I had home depo give me a quote and it was even more expensive.  does region make a difference? we are in Florida"
"only the local permit office can answer this. In some locations, the homeowner can do some/all of the work and other location, none if the work involves life-safety work of plumbing , electrical and HVAC.  Sometimes permits are not needed, others times required."
"you are spot on, if a retaining wall is done on residences, excellent chance it is built wrong. If its a low wall of 2 feet or less, its not a huge problem but I have seen  6ft retaining block walls collapse because of?....no drainage, no weeps and no tie backs."
"$10k minimum increase in value over no pool?  I'd assume it's more than that over a house with a broken pool that you now have to fix or fill.I looked at a house that had a poorly maintained pool so I did some research on the cost to fill it in.  Most estimates came back in the $8-10k range.  Though I live in an expensive area where having a pool would be substantially more than a $10k increase in value, and we also have strict environmental laws so you can't just dump some dirt in the pool and call it a day.  "
"&gt; It makes hot water but takes forever to heat up in parts of the house furthest away. The time is so long at points that I wonder if it is off.That sounds normal.  If you wanted already heated water, you would want a tank.  And it can take a bit for the water to reach the farthest portions of a house.As for the warranty company, they're going to look at every possibility to avoid paying out.  Since it does seem to ""work"", they're likely not going to pay out after they get a plumber to come and look at it."
"Ah. So two options. Scribe like I said and have a narrow trim on that side. Or rabbet out the back of the trim so it sits on top of the tile but still flush on the frame. I'm *guessing* based on the profile of your trim that the second isn't an option, but if it's thick enough for the thickness of the tile it could be.The other option, I guess, is to slap a piece of trim over the tile where it would go, mark the line, then cut the tile back with a diamond blade on an angle grinder. But that's a little hardcore."
"Black and Decker has a decent pair of books and they keepo them up to date.""complete guide to wiring"" , and ""Advanced Wiring""there are plenty of competant guides for wiring out there, it's not so much that BD's are super amazeballs, but they are reasonably priced, sometimes actually availabnle locally to buy and pick up, and lastly. most importantly, they have a whole host of other guides in the same family of books   so when that quick adjustment right here..... FUCK now we are gonna be doing some drywall."
"I hear ya on that!  When I first bought this house, the owner say they didnü__t understand why the water wasnü__t working.  They hadnü__t lived there for a couple months.  I crawled underneath and all the copper was stolen.  Didnü__t sweat it because I knew I would be upgrading anyway.  My sisters house we worked on around the corner, same thing.  They broke into the crawlspace and stole all the copper.  Wasted a whole days worth of work and $500 worth of pex and fittings, luckily I already had the crimping tool."
"I've not seen Forrest before; but, I've never really researched different blade manufacturers. I have Diablo blades from HD, and a dado stack--can't remember the manufacturer at the moment since I haven't used it in a year.&gt; The ""problem"" with Diablo blades is that they're carbide tooth but for the price of replacing teeth and getting them resharpened you could just buy another blade.In the past, I've just purchased new blades, exactly as you mention. I never felt it was worth trying to get them sharpened."
"Nope, I'm not trying to justify anything. I change my address after each house, set up mail forwarding, and have purchased a mail forwarding stamp for the new owners of my last house (as well as buy them their own return address stamp as a little house warming gift). All in all, it takes a couple hours and maybe $50.  Despite this, sometimes things get missed due to no fault of your own. Throwing people's mail away is an illegal and asshole thing to do. You're trying to justify being an asshole. It's not working."
"Personally, I despise garage conversions when looking at open houses as itü__s almost always obvious what the previous owner did. I donü__t have data to support it, but I would say itü__s a wash on value you the house. You added a room and extra bathroom, but it came at the cost of a tacky conversion. Again, this is just my own personal opinion. Iü__m sure thereü__s some sort of value increase just based on the work alone. But do what you need to do. Prioritize the relative and do whatü__s best for your family."
"Thanks for the feedback! I've got a lot of before photos backed up on my Google drive, it was pretty rough before with most of the kitchen being from 1952. We're not sure on the garage siding yet but agree it'll bee too white if we slap a coat of paint on there. We did repurpose the original doors for the fascia/siding and are going to do the gutters next. Oh, and I'll work on those pic descriptions :-) Not saying any of the work is truly professional but we're doing our best and welcome ideas and criticism. "
"The problem with oil is that it coats the plumbing and builds up over time. It doesn't sound like there is any real blockage at the moment so there isn't any reason to disassemble (not that you can even access most of the plumbing).As for the humming: who knows, it could be something rubbing that you can't see. But I wouldn't worry about it as much since the mechanical action will prevent anything from building up in the disposal. Worse case you can always replace it if it does die, they are not that expensive."
"There should also be some points on explaining the difference on why some door sizes vary from the ""standard"" door size. For example: your door is a 6'0""x 6'8"". However, because it is a patio slider it is considered a retro-fit. Which means instead of the actual size of the door being roughly 74"" due to 2 36"" slabs plus frame. The size would be built similar to a glorified window. That will make your door a 71 1/2 x 79 1/2. Which can add to the cost to have it built down. Sorry if you already covered that though."
"To be fair, the first few videos make it abundantly clear that the cyclists in your neighborhood don't give half a crap about right-of-way in the first place.That said, two-way stops on streets like this are always dicey.  My office sits on a corner that used to have one (in an urban area!) that usually hosted a fender bender or two every month.  The city finally changed it this summer, after years of issues.  It was good entertainment, but the intersection is much safer now with stop signs on all four corners."
"What is wrong with your current roof other than age? I lost 100 shingles in a storm and my new neighbor lost none. They saw my new roof that insurance paid for and said they'd start getting quotes. I told them I'm not here to tell them how to spend their money, but just because my roof looks newer isn't a reason to get a new roof. It's not a car to keep up with the Joneses.I ended up getting close to 10 quotes. Get 10 quotes if you truly need a new roof because it's failing or not cost effective to be repaired."
"Whirlpool doesn't even acknowledge the existence of the drain filter in their front loaders. I had one that started giving me all kinds of cryptic error codes about drain efficiency or something like that. I knew there was a drain filter, and it was pretty clear that it wasn't draining, so it's something obvious to check. Unfortunately you have to disassemble the entire front of the washer to get to it. Sure enough it was clogged!LG and others have a hatch on the front to allow easy access to the drain filter. "
"Yes, mine will, I'm just not quite to the finishing phase yet.  I was just surprised by how many there were and I wasn't sure if there are always that many but I never notice them because I don't normally come home from work everyday and start looking around every nook and cranny of my home to see what work was done.  But I'm pretty sure there are far more now than I used to have, and while they kind of stood out at first I'm sure eventually I'll never notice them except when they're needed, which is a good thing"
"https://www.screwfix.com/p/smith-locke-grade-13-security-hinges-satin-stainless-steel-102-x-76mm-2-pack/1190j?_requestid=1569We owned a house that was a 5-minute walk from each of our workplaces and was fantastic in layout, size, garden, convenient to both motorway and public transport, but it was in the middle of a high-crime council estate and had an outswing front door. The above hinges went in the first weekend we were there, super-easy to swap in place of the existing hinges on the hardwood door and frame."
"From everything I have read, to effectively use blown in insulation in a wall, it needs to be very densely packed to prevent settling.  This is not really possible with the machines that can be rented at home improvement stores.  They don't come with the required wand that goes into the wall, and don't blow hard enough to pack.Anecdotally, on my second floor of my old 1915 plaster house, they blew in fiberglass through the siding at some point.  When I tore down the exterior walls, I found the areas below/above the windows not filled and other areas that had random bracing not touched.  I didn't notice any water/moisture issues although it wasn't cellulose.  Only thing I noticed was lots of dirt in the insulation, which probably means they didn't pack it enough."
"It depends on how the radon fan is going to be installed. If itü__s going to pull air from a sump pump that already exists, you can go ahead and lay down the plastic.  But if thereü__s currently no sump pump and no plans for one, youü__ll want to have an access point for the radon fan to pull from underneath your plastic.In theory, the greater area it pulls from, the more effective it is, so itü__s common to dig some trenches out and away from that access area and lay corrugated pipe with holes in it so that the air can draw from additional places under the plastic.Worst case if the sump or radon fan is getting installed much later, you can always do the plastic now, then cut holes in it and seal it back up with more plastic and tape, but thatü__s extra work. "
"We're definitely a little neurotic about keeping stuff in good shape (when and where we can) and I'm inclined to agree about it being a horrible choice for a counter top. But in the name of good relationships/references moving forward we may just end up having it professionally done. And then be super vigilant about it until we move/buy/whatever we end up doing next. Of course this depends on what we're able to get for estimates ect. I'd just as soon take the time to find somebody ourselves who will do it for (just random numbers for the sake of my point) 500$ than to let a property manager upon us leaving take the first guy they can find who happens to be double the price.. If you know what i mean. If nothing else, we'll just be super careful moving forward! "
"I wish I could give you a hug and a drink right now. My mom's in a similar boat and I'm trying to do my best with helping her navigate this contractor who's now saying they cannot lay a level, flat floor because of the cheap tile my mother purchased. This was AFTER the worker here inspected the tile and told me it was fine to work with. They're now saying they usually refer clients with ""high expectations"" to other companies, which to me sounds like admitting they're providing substandard work.It took a few minutes for me to pull up my state's Home Improvement Commission, which is responsible for licensing. They do outline a complaint process on there so if you do feel like trying something to hold a shitty contractor accountable, maybe check whether that resource is available in your state.idk what the fuck we're gonna do since she can't afford to lose the $3k down payment by letting the company go now. I think the plan is to let them finish and if the tile is a tripping hazard, follow up with the Commission. "
"If you want to do a ground level deck, use an all-polymer decking, not a wood or wood-composite decking (e.g. Azek's ""capped polymer"" product https://azek.com/products/decking ).  The all-polymer is definitely pricier up front, but with a ground level deck, the labor cost involved in replacing wood or composite after a relatively short time, will end up costing more.  Also, make sure the decking has spacing between the boards -- required in many places due to impervious surface-limiting ordinances, but even if not required, and even if you're using all-polymer which won't rot, a ground level deck with little or no spacing will get yucky underneath in many climates.  You need water (or melting snow) to drop through the deck surface easily, and keep refreshing the ground underneath.  The deck in your second picture looks like it has little or no board spacing and also almost no ventilation space around the edges, which floating just above grass level in some spots and apparently resting on the ground/grass in others."
"I hope not to bore with the tech explanation, but here it is:When talking about ""blocking sound"", soundproofing, or sound isolation, engineers know that 100% sound ""proofing"" is never practical, so we look at the *threshold of annoyance* for the sound. In some cases that can be equal to the *threshold of audibility*, and in some cases it is much higher -- in open plan offices we don't mind hearing that other people are talking, but we mind being distracted by their conversation, so it might ""good enough"" to use cubicle partitions and soft surfaces that keep most normal-voice-level speech unintelligible between partitions.Your windows and windowless wall aren't sound*proof*, but they do have a high enough [sound transmission coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_transmission_class) to bring the level of the freeway and railway below your threshold of audibility.The threshold of audibility is different for different persons and in different situations -- people with hearing loss, for example, have a higher threshold -- sound needs to be louder before they hear it.Likewise, with a forced-air heating system operating and creating noise due to the machinery and the turbulance of air in the ducts and through grills, other sounds will need to be correspondingly louder before they are noticeable. Open-plan office designers take advantage of this by using [""noise masking systems""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_masking#Attributes_of_Successful_Sound_Masking_Systems), which help particularly with keeping conversations private from people further away in a room.If you browse soundproofing questions in this sub you will see a lot of people suggest running air-cleaning machines, fans and white-noise-apps for unfortunate rental-housing occupants who are victims of noisy housemates or neighbors. For outdoors in a home that you own, there are better options that operate on the same principle -- **instead of trying to ""block"" the offending sound to below the threshold of audibility, raise the threshold of audibility by introducing noises that are natural and not offensive.**The classic solution is bamboo plants -- this can be troublesome, as many are invasive plants in north America, and extremely difficult to control. But you can find ""clumping"" varieties that tend not to spread, and corral them using containers. The slightest breeze through the leaves creates rustling sounds, and thus the highway would need to be that much louder to be as annoying. Several species of deciduous trees have ""quaking"" leaves and emit sound with very little wind. Plantings that provide food or habitat for birds and crickets will attract sound-emitters that will specialize in dawn and evening choruses. Ornamental pond or fountain installation provides the noise-masking of the trickling water as well as habitat for frogs.Nature is rarely silent, yet we find it peaceful. Best results come if the masking noises are in the same general direction as the offending ones, but the plantings don't need to be so high that the view is blocked."

"Alrighty I'll track down a set of the rods and give it a shot tomorrow. I just went back out and watched the spring while I moved the garage door up and down and I don't see any cracked or damaged parts so I'm assuming that yeah, it's just not tensioned properly."
Another vote for the Ego - I have the blower and trimmer.  Both work great.  I had an issue with one of my batteries that got resolved via warranty with no questions asked.  I'll prob get their mower when my 1980's Snapper 2-cycle bites the dust (hint: it won't).
"Appreciate it! I would love to make it an egress but can't justify the added cost - they run around 4k here to be done professionally, which I'd want given that our foundation is 110 years old - because our basement ceilings are too low to count as livable space."
"Appreciate the reply and help. I could have swore I stressed to the contractor guy I used that I wanted to make sure preparation was made for movement, as I'm in Texas and we have horrible soil. I don't think any of my corners in the shower are siliconed either. "
"As other commenter mentioned, it could be an area where the ceiling had been damaged and repaired with spackle/joint compound and painted over.Would recommend finding a joist/stud. Amazon has finders unless you want to ü__knock-knock drillü_ù until you find it."
"As others have said, don't do this. It's impractical, unreasonable, and a huge liability. Relationships are about compromise. Your financÄ˜e will just have to use a step stool. Buy a few folding step stools. [They even come in purple](http://amzn.com/B06VWPYPLP)!"
"Basically you need to build a new wall between the two homes. Also as others have said, you should also look into fire blocking in the attic and crawl space/basement for safety reasons. [Mike Holmes did exactly this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlAZsYp2M-U) "
"Bought a Bosch from a scratch and dent with a minor scratch and missing kick plate 4 years ago.  $30 kick plate later and the thing has been a work horse with zero issues.  Definitely recommend Bosch, easy to clean/maintain and quietest dishwasher I've ever seen."
Can you explain more about what drywall work you had done? It looks like little or no attention was paid to the boxes. If it was just a question of being too deep you can add box extensions but these ones don't even appear to be lined up with the drywall cutouts.
"Floor and foundation you could do on your own to save money. Doors and windows, probably would cost less to upgrade via tuffshed from the outset. By the time you framed it properly, got more windows, and resealed it all back up, you would have probably spent more"
"Honestly, just use a space heater.  Curious hands might touch something hot - once.  Just make sure it can't tip over, and make sure it can't start a fire.  I have a little heater in my office that has a tilt sensor.  If it's not (reasonably) level, it shuts off."
"How old is your basement? I used Drylok on my 5 year old basement walls and never saw a drop of water. Of course, if I was going to finish it with drywall I would have used a moisture barrier and waterproof insulation as well, but the drylok is a good start imho "
I *really* don't want a wireless doorbell though. I'm fine with running cables and wiring the chime and transformer. I also don't mind going up into the attic if that's what it takes... but I'd much rather have something that I don't need to replace batteries in.
"I 2nd/3rd getting a quote on blown in.   Aberdeen has a Home Depot, and Port Orchard has a lowes.  I'd highly recommend blown in over batting, even if you do it yourself.  Getting in the far edges of your crawl space is a pain to get batting in and laid properly."
"I appreciate the advice, I'll take another look to verify and then try to reach out to the manufacturer.  The previous owner said he never had screens (which was weird but in the home buying process I just glossed over it) if I remember correctly but who knows.  "
I did this two years ago and went for 110ü__. Dug it all by hand. I think you have a solid plan. I also ran into many tree roots and had no problem with them. All I did is cut them with a sawzall on each side of the trench and they came right out. Go for it man. 
"I have a large, old Victorian with a funky roof line, lots of peaks, and very steep slopes.That range was from seven different quotes. Most of the cost is labor, partly because of the roof itself but also because my lot makes it difficult to bring materials in."
"I have been unable to locate where they come in. Ditching the ceiling should make it easier to figure it out Iü__m thinking, since everything will be visible. If need be Iü__d get an exterminator if the problem persisted and all would be visible to see. Thoughts?"
"I own a house with mostly two pronged outlets.Put in the adapter, make sure to actually screw it in the faceplate of your outlet, and use a surge protector.   My town has lots of power outages and I've yet to have a piece of electronics go out.*knock on wood*"
"I poured my own pan, but I definitely used a pvc liner. It's like $35 and completely waterproof.  I'm not 100% sure on this but I think international plumbing code requires a 24 or 48 hr flood test, and I highly doubt that the redguard alone would pass the test. "
"I think it is pine! It's a bit splintery and i have to hire someone to patch up those holes. It's a pretty cheap rental so maybe I'll just fill the whole thing with wood putty. Maybe if i just put like 5 coats of poly, I just don't want anyone getting a splinter!"
"I think the mounting block would work fine.  Depending on your decor preferences just about anything would do.  You could just use a block of wood to cover it, chamfer the edges (or use an edge-forming router bit to make an even nicer edge) and paint or stain it."
If I can't get things resolved I might have to take this action. I'm just not sure that I have enough evidence that I attempted to resolve the issues through normal means and that enough time has passed to prove the Contractor had enough time to correct the work.
"If it came back together pretty reasonably, it's OK, but one caution is paint freezing. If your paint was stored in a unheated garage or shed, the paint can freeze, and if it's water based paint, it'll turn to ice and never really come back to normal/work right. "
"If there's space for you to get around everywhere then yes. But please please get at least 3/4 ply wood, I'm 170ish and half inch flexes on me, play it safe and get 3/4, make sure the pieces you get up there are easy to move around and easy for you to lay out on."
If you can't find that look for weather stripping that has the same size nub on the top that slides into the window and any type of bottom as long as it fits into the groove and fills it as completely as possible. You might have to try a couple of different ones.
"In the photo, the layer underneath the new/clumpy mud is 48 hours old.  The opposite corner is 24 hours old.  I can't say for certain that the opposite corner was dry, but I'm fairly certain the side I was working on was.  Does the opposite side make this happen?"
"Just whack them with a shovel as you find them. It's not pleasant, but it's no worse than a trap. Poisons are dangerous to other animals, and humane traps tend to result in a slow painful death due to people not checking on them frequently enough. Just whack em. "

"Moving the wall with the shower head will be a bit troublesome (as you've pointed out, it's a wetwall).  Short of moving the toilet, I'm not sure you've got anywhere to expand.  Might be looking at combining or totally reworking both the laundry and the bathroom."
Never seen anything like that. Not sure why the fill tube is split like that. Seems like you could somehow seal that hole and remove that pipe. Another option would be to replace the tank with something more standard. Interested to find out what that pipe is for.

"Rotting wood and numerous, small light brown insects make me think termites. Termite colonies often have a strong smell of decay and/or fungus. You might have serious problems there, and I would pull the cabinet out completely to uncover the extent of the damage."
Sounds like a min flow rate problem. Work around or solution. You should be able to set the temp of the water heater somehow.  Turn it down to hot enough for a shower and only use the hot water to shower. Turning down the temp should increase your flow rate too. 
"Spreaders/Stabilizers are cheap and make everything so much easier. Theyü__re great for not damaging the gutter, but it makes it so much easier to reach a bigger area. Having that extra, wider stability at the top of the ladder is great. I think they help a lot. "

"Was raised in a country home with a cistern well that produced waaaaaay less than that. A full running shower will only use roughly 2 gpm. Entire wash load has less than 5 per cycle, and thats the large tub sized. I say go.for.it. use the well as is untilit dies."
Water and dish soap in a spray bottle also works. Just get a professional spray cleaning bottle at Home Depot. They have a strong stream and are only about $3.  We use this all the time.  Much cheaper and you donü__t have to worry about inhaling nasty chemicals. 
"We're about to replace some switches and outlets in what will be a nursery. Can someone please explain what we're looking at in the picture here, or what I might want to look for to ensure safety as we switch them out? If it matters, the house was built circa 74."
"When sealing for radon systems they typically just use silicon caulking, if it's good enough for radon, should be good enough for water vapor.  That said, it probably isn't that big of a humidity contributor if it's covered more than 90% with the current setup.  "

"Wow the balls on those neighbors! We just bought our first house with a very steep front yard/steps like this. If you don't mind me asking, what is your driveway like? Ours is very steep and I wonder how others fair with a steep driveway. Your yard looks great!"
Yeah it's not line voltage so it's not a huge safety concern.  It's already buried so I'd definitely just leave it alone at this point.  It's one of those things a future owner might not know about though when they're adding plants to the current mulch only area.

"You could use a battery powered unit and also leave the mechanical thermostat wired to the heat lines on a very low failsafe temperature like 50 degrees or something. That way if the battery unit dies will you're gone, the mechanical unit will still save the day."
"You may not necessarily need 2 2x8s. Depending on the size and shape of your building,  2 2x6s *could* work just fine.  As you've said, you'd have to consult a local engineer to know for sure what's allowed. On the plus side, replacing it would be cheap and easy."
You should be fine. I just did a roof on my house and had 5 low profile ohagin vents installed. That included a garage. Socal too. Ohagin actually has a cent calculator on their site where you can put in details to determine the recommended vent number. Try that.

"Loose wires in the motor housing can cause that noise. Sometimes a ticking sound is actually an unbalanced blade set moving something  in the housing. Make sure the blades are clean and are not sagging. Turn on the fan and watch that the blades donü__t have much up and down movement and if you hear that sound see if it corresponds to the interval of the blades spinning. If itü__s out of balance you can add weights to the blades or on some fans make slight adjustments to where the blades attach to the blade arm."
"&gt; If anything happens to the system - failed inverter, failed/broken panel, bad wiring etc the leasing company is responsible. The micro inverters on each panel (assuming it's not a central inverter) have around a 20 year warranty, and when they start going bad you're looking at $600 a pop.This has nothing to do with maintenance costs though, which my original comment was focused on.I think we're mostly in agreement here, it's just that I don't think the maintenance costs are anything to be concerned about."

"For something that small here is what I would do:* 1. Make sure you extract ALL of the damaged wood* 2. Treat the surrounding wood with boric acid (I have not personally used this product but Home Depot's site has: ""Board Defense Borate Powder"" that looks to be EPA safe and easy to apply). This will kill any remaining fungus that may be in the wood that was not manually removed.* 3. Fill hole with wood filler and possibly waterproof depending on where this hole is located in relation to the shower.Good luck!"
"Ha. I did the exact thing. Mine was a slab, not a butcher block. But upper cabinets come in \~12"" depths. So mine's set out from the wall an inch or two and then a cover panel hides the gap. Mine's also on a \~10"" toe kick to bring my 30"" cabinet up to bar height.At the end of the day a cabinet is just a box.OP's plan of 12"" base and 12"" overhang will make for a fairly cramped bar. 12"" isn't much knee room. He'll likely want to have full-depth side panels to support the countertop. But it's certainly feasible."
"Hello. Thank you for the suggestion. Our contractor talked about sealing the floor, is that similar to the shellac-based primer that you mention? Yes the rest of the basement is the interlocking LVP flooring. The floor wasn't terribly even when previous owners installed. I even wonder if they happened to cover up some drains and there are some obvious small dips in areas. Nothing that really concerns me too much. The room we want to redo has no drain and the floor is fairly even, besides whatever the reside adds."
"I bought a home last year with a hydronic heating system and installed two new Ecobee3 thermostats (one to control the upstairs and downstairs air handlers) to replace the home's original programmable thermostats.  I haven't setup all of the remote occupancy/temperature sensors yet, but it still works like a charm.Also be sure to check your local utility company for any rebates or savings on energy efficient products and upgrades.  Mine provided a $75 rebate just for purchasing and installing a smart thermostat."
"I'm in S.FL. too. The only way a vent in the door will help is if you can somehow circulate the air, which will likely mean opening a vent on the wall opposite of the door, or putting some sort of vent on the roof. That said, if you live near the water and there is salt in the air, venting won't help much. If the shed is well sealed &amp; has power, you can run a small dehumidifier - that's what I do in the garage. Also a good idea to run a lightly oiled rag over the stuff you don't want rusting, just in case."
"Id warn that fireplaces can actually reduce the temp of the house as it vents a ton of its heat out the flue, and sucks cold air in from every crevice in your home.A cast iron insert may be a bit better for radiating heat into the room than an open flame... but Im not sure it will extend much beyond the room it is in.&amp;#x200B;anyway...  Id have to say dont leave a fire burning in your house.  it \*should\* be fine.  they've been used for centuries.  But then again... home fires werent exactly rare either."
"If this were mine I would be worried about it unless I had a better angle.  The pipes look misaligned as well as it looks like there are 2 different types of pipe.  If those pipes are misaligned it won't take long for items to begin getting hung up as the water runs away from the solids.  Eventually this will lead to a clog and a service call.  I would personally have expected a better cut job and a tighter joint.  A ferco would be great then.  Just slapping one on to cover a big gap is unacceptable.&amp;#x200B;"
"Is this a rental? Here in the US, mold is a trigger for lawsuits. Any reasonable landlord would get this corrected immediately.  For dehumidifiers, a 50 pint in US standards is about 24 liters and that is about the smallest ""real"" dehumidifier sold here. Anything smaller is really just a waste of time. Dehumidifiers are loud, expensive to run, and they heat the room considerably. You should really make sure there isn't a problem that can be corrected before dropping an obnoxious dehumidifier in such a small space."
"That's actually what I'm contemplating. The garage door is over 20 years old. I'm actually considering having the entire door replaced. Upgrade to an insulated steel door with windows.

"The idea of laying additional subfloor is certainly the easiest.  Just a few things to think about. 1. Your toe kick for the cabinets could  no longer fit your feet if you add additional flooring2. You might not be able to remove or service your dishwasher after flooring is installed3. Stove might raise above the countertopsGiven your situation and not wanting to remove cabinets to completely tear up the floor I still think the above is your best option.  Just a few issues to be mindful of in the future. "
"This is really regionally dependent. In my area it is pretty common to heat individual rooms with gas heaters (either traditional looking fireplaces/stoves or more utilitarian heaters). If you want to go this route you need to make sure that you buy a unit that is actually intended to produce heat. Some gas ""fireplace"" logs are mostly decorative and don't really put out any meaningful heat. Also the use of ventless gas appliances is somewhat controversial and may be illegal in your area, so take that into account."
"To clarify, it can be connected to an upstream outlet provided that outlet and the outlets upstream of it are also hard wired with a continuous connection to the main panel.  Just don't want you to think that because it is connected to another outlet that it is a problem, just that it can be if said upstream outlet itself isnt grounded.This is why you check both hot to ground for 120v and and neutral against the ground continuity, to verify that it is in fact a true ground and not just jumped somewhere upstream."

"You can rent what's called a ""toilet auger"" at Home Depot for like $10. It's basically a snake that is specifically built for toilets.If that auger doesn't clear it then the clog is farther down and you'll probably need to take the toilets off and snake the drain. Which also isn't a huge deal and you can rent or buy powered drain snakes for not a ton of money, too.If you want to call a pro, you can find plumbers with specials to snake a drain for fairly cheap. Getting availability in a hurricane might be hard."
"a moderate price tile shower enclosure and glass door can start around $4,000 (or more) if you are planning to do the work yourself with proper knowledge and tools,  If you pay some one, easily twice that or more.

"Check it over carefully. If ANY rung or part of the rail is dented or crushed I would toss it. Look along the rails to make sure all 4 are straight. Also check for cracking or serious corrosion. Check that the feet are still stable and that the locking dogs engage properly.If everything looks OK, there is no reason that the age should be a concern.Keep in mind that aluminum ladders are in general not as sturdy as fiberglass ones, and also they are unsuitable for any work around electricity.Also not to be obvious but make sure you know how to use a ladder safely. Watch some youtube videos. The critical parts are making sure the feet are stable and level, and making sure you get the angle right. Ladders are one of the most dangerous tools so treat it with care."

"What do you need to know about buying a house?  That's a seperate topic entirely!  /r/personalfinace has some good discussion.  Bottom line, your main concern doing this will be cash.

"What was the objective of the project when you hired them?  Did you tell them you were having moisture issues in the basement?  Are the moisture issues reduced after putting in the french drain?  I wouldn't jump immediately to the conclusion that they did it wrong. If you have a full basement below grade just adding a capillary break between the french drain and the foundation would not address all the wall surface below the drain that is unsealed.    If they suggested completely excavating the basement and sealing it for triple what you paid would you have done it?Check your gutters.  Are they operational?  Are there gutters in the right places?  Are the gutters sized correctly?Where do the gutters drain to?  You shouldn't be having massive water issues unless your drainage system is compromised.   French drains move sheet surface water around a foundation and do a great job of it but they are only one component of a drainage system.

"I didn't think I needed to specify that opinion based on real facts and not misinformation would be preferred.You didn't answer my question about what kind of connector was in your microwave box.Then please educate me, how little surface contact do they have? "
"I donü__t like tying my dog out in the meantime though. It makes him act like a jerk. And if there are off leash dogs in the area (likely the case if other yards are unfenced and itü__s out in the country), Iü__d fear an altercation. My dog hates most other dogs. "
"I have no idea what you're talking about. If you live in a winter climate, your basement is already heated for the pipes. Basements stay so warm in winter and so cool in summer because the ground insulates them. I just dont see why more insulation would be needed."
"I once tried to get a quote from Harlequin but did not have much luck. I think the traditional ones are pretty expensive. They make them that just have padding underneath. Edit: but that was years ago. Now they have a good website. Google Harlequin sprung floors"
"I think you have a misinterpretation of code unless you are suggesting to go well beyond code.  No spot should be more than 6' from an outlet, meaning 12' (as the spot between would be 6' from either) or less. It less for things like behind countertops, though.   "
"I would use a chemical stripper, or even a heat gun.  Both will soften up the paint for easy removal.  I like CitriStip, as it is non-toxic.  For a heat gun, just about any of them will work:https://www.homedepot.com/p/Wagner-Furno-300-Heat-Gun-0503059/206723935"
"I'm no professional to take what I say with a grain of salt. For the gap I would caulk just like I would for any other moulding, for the cracks and damaged corner I would spackle and sand. Cracks almost always come back.After all that a nice fresh coat of paint."
"If the light is not designed to accept standard 12 or 14 ga wiring, are you sure it's intended for household use at all? That would be a red flag to me that you are working with some weird gray market knockoff. For electrical fixtures you want something UL listed."
"If you want to be safe, have a structural engineer looks at it and recommend any reinforcements. You'll have to pay for the engineering, but you'll save money on not over building the floor, and you'll save lots of money if you avoid causing the floor to collapse."
"It's 3"" deep, and the wallboard is 1.25"" thick in that area.  So I'd need to cut/chisel away 1.75"" deep into that stud.  I'd also have to cut through all the lath to the right, which would probably cause more damage to the plaster than I'm interested in repairing."
"Its not really in ""the middle"" of the line.  He only has one gas appliance so that valve must be pretty close to the furnace.  My guess is a short flex line just below that reducer.  Just start at the end and work back, likely just two points need to disconnect.  "
"Iü__m 5ü__2ü_ù and had a step stool storage area designed into the toe kick of my kitchen counters. The step stool is on rollers when folded so it slides under the bottom cabinet not taking up and cabinet space and it not tied to the location, Itü__s fantastic. "
"LOL.  The OP could save $10K just contracting out the slab himself. Realize excavation is even another item. So that's not included. $2500 for a guy riding around on a dirt mover. It's good work if you can get it!Maybe they get their concrete from Wisconsin?"
"Like I said, you can definitely get other brands cheaper, but I prefer to use the ones I know are of utmost quality. Iü__d rather fork out a bit of extra dough now and not have to worry about them failing as the Chinese made ones are known to do in a couple years."
"Nice, let me know if you need any addt'l info or pics. I have two installed and a third sitting out waiting to be installed. Only issue I've run into is my electrical boxes are too far from the drywall for the screws they include so I've had to go get longer ones."
"Thanks. It's already been a nightmare.Looks like a lot of washers require an inch of clearance on each side now. If I get one that doesn't require a clearance, like [this one](https://c.shld.net/assets/docs/spin_prod_892335712.pdf), do you think that would work?"
"That's going to have to require some electrical surgery, I am afraid. You will have to identify the fixture where the branching occurs, so you can separate out the  areas you want to keep.  Probably won't be easy.  No telling how the original installer did things."
"The easiest, best bang for your buck, low maintenance, and visually pleasing upgrade is grade and put down a heavy weed barrier, install a boarder of your choosing (cobblestone looks timeless) and install 1"" stone of your liking. Grey granite stone looks nice too."
The fact that the junction box was inaccessible means it was probably done DIY. NEC code states that all boxes must have access for maintenance There's zero reason for a dryer to have a junction box either. It's a dedicated device. You definitely dodged a bullet. 
"The lamp works perfectly fine, when I turn it on via the local switch (on the cord). My problem is that it wonü__t respond to the light switch on the wall since unplugging it and plugging it back in. Iü__m not sure Iü__m being super clear on this, so bear with me!"
"The metal does sound like a good fix, but donü__t ignore the excellent architectural sealants out there.  Vulkem, osi, and tens more are making 30+year oil-based sealants that just donü__t fail. Easy, paintable, relatively permanent. Metal sounds good too though"
"The shower had been redone as part of the flip, so we had only planned on dealing with the floors. Iü__ll definitely pull up the boards and replace. Iü__ve never heard of Durock. Doing that in the threshold to the bathroom definitely seems like a good idea though!"
"This maybe a stupid question... but asking anyway.  Not the neutral or hot, but I found electrical tape wrapping a copper crimp around 3 grounds that were twisted together in a box.  Is this dangerous and should I be going through all my switches/outlets/fixtures?"
"This was my other thought.  Rather than replace each switch or outlet with a WiFi device,. Wire it back to a whole house home automation panel.  But the the cost of wiring will most likely outweigh the cost of the device...Ehh.  Just a random thought/idea I had "
"Water will get in one way, then travel to a different spot along beams and other construction material before finally showing up as a leak in the ceiling. In my shoes I would get it fixed fast before a small amount of water damage turns into a much bigger ordeal. "
"We change the filters about 2-3 times per year and don't smoke in the house or anything.  I have something like a borescope, so I think I'm going to hook that up, snake it around some of the ducts, and see how dirty the ducts are.  Thanks so much for your comment!"
"What about primer and paint?Did I make a huge mistake in assuming that modern (latex?) paints can do both, as long as there is some proper prep? If I have been running my mouth due to ignorance, I would rather be wrong and correct myself ASAP. :)&amp;#x200B;"
When you take apart the knob there is usually a metal or plastic stick (like a tongue depressor) that is supposed to ride up in the little turny part of the lock in the handle. If you saw or break off the end of this stick it won't reach to the lock turny thing.  
"Yeah, my parents house had carpet over hardwood in the living room. They finally decided to pull up the carpet and finish the floors. We took turns for days (literally multiple days) pulling staples. That was 10 years ago and I am still haunted by the experience. "
"Yep, I'm in the US.  Good to know.  If I don't call the gas company to have them do it I'll pick up one of those.Honestly I'd rather not deal with the hecticness of calling the gas company or fire department, so I may just pick up a detector and troubleshoot it."
"Yep.Moved into a house with a Zoeller sump pump that had been running for 10+ years.When it eventually failed, I took it to the local contractor's supply warehouse and said ""Gimme another just like this one.""Dropped it in, and haven't worried about it since."
"Yes it would.  How big of a space it is?  I'd put something like this in the main room.  Totally optional, but I'd put a 500-750w baseboard heater in each bedroom as supplemental heat.  That way they can keep the bedrooms nice and warm even with the door closed."
You can plant a seed mix with annual rye grass. Its cheap and will germinate very quickly. Then kill off what ever is left in the spring when you are ready to lay your sod. These are used on roadways and construction sites where you need quick erosion protection. 
"You can save this on the punch list of when you call an electrician for something more serious.  I get it all the time when I show up for one thing and ""Oh by the way, while you're here, can you look at this other thing?""... It likely wouldn't cost too much more. "
"You can seal the concrete all you want, it will fail in short order and the moisture will find a way in. While you might not have visible water in the basement, the mold says there's moisture. So, do a moisture test, remedy the issue and then finish your project. "
"Good info -- thanks.According to their website, as a CA resident I may not need the power wall, but I guess I'll see what they say.I'm not worried if the tiles DON'T last 30 years because their warranty, presuming TESLA and Solar City are still companies in 30 years, will cover it.I'm not a big Tesla fan, but the idea of solving both issues at one time is attractive, no matter who makes it.As for the cost, well...not having a power bill will definitely help pay it down, and a normal roof wouldn't do that..."
"Here is a short building inspector story...A buddy of mine is a general contractor.  He gets a call from his plumbing guy that the inspector failed his work and wants all the new plumbing for a bathroom ripped out and replaced.  The inspector insisted that purple PVC primer is not code compliant, it needs to be clear.  Itü__s was the inspectors first plumbing inspection, and a politically connected relative got him the job.  He had zero building experience, but he was a avid watcher of home improvement shows.  "
"I have personally seen ply subfloors rotted along grout lines.  Moisture seems to be able to get anywhere when you don't want it to.Wax isn't generally considered moisture permeable, as far as I know. I do take your point, and in a quality install over cement board with light colored grout maybe I'd recommend a sealer.  Nothing is going to explode with grout sealer. For the most part I think it's a waste of time, and you are better off with darker colored grout where stains don't look so awful in the long term."
"I've actually looked into getting one, but unfortunately there's like a 3 month wait time on a ladder that large for my weight (300lbs).  I have no idea why that is.  I guess they gotta make them to order.  I had previously checked the local stores and found nothing even close.  The house is also in a street that's on a steep downgrade, to complicate things further.  I do not know anyone who even owns a ladder around here, let alone a tall ladder fit for me.  I'm going to have to make due with whatever i can reach."
"If I waited until the gentrification process was further along, Iü__d have been priced out and missed the opportunity.  I traded some risk for a lot of equity.  Luckily the window happened weeks before I moved in, which is what provided the opportunity for the thief.  They know a lot of houses are vacant and being worked on, so they search for those.That and for the worst case scenario, my camera system covers my house at most angles.  And for the worst worst case scenario, thatü__s what the 2nd Amendment is for."
"It *could* be corrosion inside the breakers or where they connect to the box, and flipping them off/on knocked some corrosion off. I rented an apartment where the main breaker was corroded (I don't know details), and when we turned on the stove lights would dim and the smoke alarm would beep. I told the rental office, and they called the fire department and we had to wait outside because of a possible fire hazard while an electrician did their job. It was an over-reaction, but people gonna do what people gonna do. "
"Iü__ve read that they make a cheaper version of Purdy for the big box store, but I have no idea of that is true. Loweü__s seems to have recently have rolled out another big partnership with wherein Williams so I think they would carry the same brushes as SW. I originally bought mine from the SW paint store. They are designed to hold a lot of paint. You want to cut in by basically using the brush to push the bead of paint along the wall and create the line. Were you loading up the brush with a fair amount of paint? "
"That seems excessive to me. Typically if you aren't adhering the foam to the substrate, you use stick pins placed all over the wall or ceiling surface and the foam gets pressed into them: http://www.buyinsulationproductstore.com/self-sticking-insul-hangers-bulk-box/If you aren't placing the foam on a ceiling, you don't even have to use the washers with the stick pins. Just get pins that mostly or fully penetrate the foam layer. Faster and easier than ramsetting the foam into the wall. A heck of a lot quieter too."
"We have a lumber store around here that will do all that work for you - I've brought them an old door before, they take a few measurements and do all the work to the new door (mortise hinges, drill holes for knobs, etc) so that all I had to do was put on the hinges and other hardware and it fit like a glove.  It's been a few years so I don't recall exactly what it cost, though....  Might be worth calling a lumberyard that has an in house carpenter though.  Perhaps where you're ordering the doors from.&amp;#x200B;"
"Why would anyone downvote? WoodEpox is really fantastic stuff and probably some of the easiest to work with. Abatron sells compatible dry pigments that, with some practice, allow you to make cosmetic repairs to even finish grade surfaces. And you can vary the stiffness by blending it with Abatron Liquid Wood. Certainly far superior to any of the two-part polyester epoxies available at the home centers. I've even managed to learn how to comb it out with brushes to match rough faced exterior trim or create graining. "
"Would have to be mortar in place with tile on top with the liner. It's small 30 x 30.  Have watched many youtube videos at this point and it doesn't look all that complicated, but I can also see where certain workers would cut corners and do a shitty job that you will have to pull apart in a year. Oddly it was the termite company that quoted $1300 to repair dry rot and leaking shower pan.  Somehow I don't trust this estimate and don't really trust them to do a proper job of it now that I know what needs to be done."
"Yea, I wouldnü__t call this area up and comingü__ but this is an area where there are a lot of manufacturing plants... and with how Trump has been kicking up tariffs, those plants have been getting more and more volume. Which is why I think it will be a viable location to rent eventually.It also helps that I work with (not for) the UAW, so I know how those contracts work and I think if I got some UAW tenants I would be set. Just a matter of waiting until Iü__m ready to move and seeing how the landscape is then."
"You'll probably be in good shape for awhile. Our floors (red oak) looked way, WAY worse than that.  They were already worn when we moved in 5 years ago.  Have an 80 lbs dog that had a few accidents, 2 cats that puke everywhere, and now a toddler.  Wood was bare and almost no finish anywhere by the time we got them refinished a couple weeks ago.  They look brand new now.  The after photo still has fresh poly on it, but I was amazed at how it looked even after just the sanding was done: https://m.imgur.com/a/cUxFrIn "
"Ok, so are you arguing against me or for me cause I specifically said that no one installs solar on their roof in hopes of selling them for a profit down the road. Thatü__s not how this works - solar on a roof IS NOT a depreciating investment like windows or a new roof is, because the second you put a new roof on, money is spent and it loses value every day. Solar doesnü__t lose value, because it creates revenue. Sure over 30 years the revenue will decrease by roughly 30% (assuming electricity stays constant). But it still is making money, this it is not depreciating. Of course if you sold it or tried to you would get 5% of your money back, but then you would have to add that value to all the money you made to determine its loss on value from when it was installed.

"This.My selling agent (also my buying agent, but I digress) was like ""make sure everything is perfect, patch all the holes, etc"".Spent a good day or two after we took off all the wall decor removing anchors, spackling, and painting.  Got the basement spotless.  Like, it'd never been so empty.  Even vacuumed out the cobwebs from the joists.Move into the new house, there's old wallpaper in the crawlspace (there's not a single papered surface in the house), a pile of trash behind the shed (didn't even notice it in the walkthrough), lots of little nailholes and gauges in the walls, etc.  Not enough to raise a stink over but still a PITA.  Turned out there was a bunch of shit in the shed too, but hey, I got a free axe, so I got that going for me, which is nice."
"Your water chemistry is the most important factor. Don't dictate one opinion over another. Your location is important. The only reason you see one fail over the other is water chemistry.  Will you have a whole home filtration system?

"a direct vent propane fireplace is a good localized heat source. A ventless propane fireplace is decorative and a good way to grow mold in your house/attic.I am not a fan of replacing working equipment. A boiler is pretty modular /repairable and the replacement is very unlikely to ""pay off"" with efficiency improvement.The things that fail with boilers are peripheral to the boiler [pumps/aquastats/zone valves/air bleeders/expansion tanks etc]I would spend some time/research understanding the workings of your boiler. Particularly learn how to bleed the air from your system as it is by far the most common fault causing ""no heat"".One other tip ? investigate propane suppliers in your area. Pricing varies WIDELY. There may be a buyer's co-op available in your area"
"Condensation forms on the inside of the radiator when the steam hits it. If this condensation canü__t drain back down the pipe, it pools up and the new steam canü__t get through. Pressure builds and eventually it pushes through the water, and this is the knocking sound you are hearing. This is also why they say to have your radiators sloped back toward the pipe, so that the condensation can drain back down. I used to live in an apartment with steam heat, and we would prop up the end of the radiators with quarters. It really doesnü__t matter what you use though. They weigh a ton so the hardest part is lifting them up. There should be a valve at each radiator too. If you are too hot, you can close the valve on any given radiator if you want to turn that radiator ü__offü_ù. Be advised though that the valve should always be either fully open or fully closed - if you leave it partially open, condensation will have a hard time draining out and steam will still try to come in, so you will just experience more knocking.

"Couple problems here.You should be posting on /r/electricians . You can't put UF inside conduit, not allowed. I doubt you could even get 10/2 UF through 400 feet of 1/2"" anyway. You'll need separate conductors, and I'd go with something far larger than 10/2. You think you'll ever put an office in the barn that needs AC? How about a shop and a bunch of power tools or a welder. How about electric heat or a well/sprinkler pump for the garden?Also your depth still might not be right if you'll have a driveway over the trench:http://www.xwalk.com/images/Table_300.5-Min_Cover_Reqts.pdfSecond, will the barn be grounded separately from the house? If you're running ethernet, which at 500 feet using good cable, yea, that might work. might need to run it only at 100mb. BUT, ethernet is copper wire, which means if you have separate grounds, you'll have a possibility of different grounding potential, which the electricity will try to balance out by going down your network cable and burning things out. So you want fiber."
"So Iü__m on the same boat. Just purchased my home with a solar lease. Mine is 15yr least and I pay $50/month for the lease. My utility bill(gas &amp; electric) is $25 at most and 50% is just to have the account open. Some months we actually get a credit from our electric company and we donü__t pay gas/electric that month and a reduced payment the next. So the most we pay is $75 and the least is $50. This is a 3bed 2 bath home 1200 sq feet and like 50 lightbulbs in the house. Air conditioning had been running non stop since early April. I used to live in a smaller 2 bed 1 bath home and paid $300+ a month from April to September and around $200 the rest of the time. (Also gas &amp; electric) I think itü__s well worth it at least for me. A neighbor purchased theirs and they pay 250/month for 8 years I believe. tl;drMy solar lease is 15yrs and i pay $50/mo plus $25/mo for gas/electric combined. Sometimes my gas/electric bill is free and with next month credit. Neighbor purchased their solar for 250/mo for 8yrs."
"&gt; Do you have any air ducting in the house at all (I saw you run hydronic heat)? If you do, running the fan 5-10 minutes an hour will definitely mix the air. I got a new thermostat (Nest) that allows that and it's made a huge difference in my basement conditions.Well, yes and no. There's a retrofitted A/C system, but the return and all the vents are upstairs, except for one vent on the other side of the basement...so I am not sure how much good that would do. Rearranging that system is something I'd like to do eventually - moving the return downstairs so it can pull the cooler basement air up in the summer seems like it would be a good efficiency booster, and the basement needs more airflow anyway - but that's not a priority for right now. I keep the shop door closed all the time too, so it might not make much of a difference for this particular problem either. &gt; Certainly insulating the pipes would help, but it's going to be limited by the fact that the heat is still there, and the room is still there, and unless something else changes, you're just slowing the flow of heat. The actual amount of energy is still there.I think insulating would reduce the amount of heat dumped into the room, wouldn't it? Right now, the hot water in the pipes loses some heat to the shop, so then there's 179 degree water going to the rooms, whereas I could insulate and keep that heat in the water and send 180 degrees to the radiators? But then I guess when the heating call ends, it's just stationary hot water sitting there. "
"It is old news, and was hugely full of fear mongering.  The report cited the fact that the Chinese manufactured product violated California's standards.

I've searched extensively on the 'Net for even one single instance of someone getting verifiably sick or injured from this flooring, and failed.While I agree that formaldehyde is not something that I want floating around in my household, the whole 60 Minutes report was neither fair nor balanced.

"Dissenting opinion here:  I friggin hate plaster and lath (no ü__eü_ù at the end).  Itü__s just a mess.  People say things about it adding character and actually cite cracks as character.  To me thatü__s crazy, I like my walls flat and smooth.The real problem though is that, depending on the condition of the plaster, it may only worsen over time.  Every repair ultimately further hurts the flatness of the wall, and depending on a number of factors, repairs wonü__t necessarily hold up that well.  You canü__t use a stud finder through it, youü__ll need masonry bits to drill through it, and if ever you need to do some work on your house and youü__re removing plaster piecemeal, it makes an absolute fucking mess.  Itü__s dirty and dusty and heavy and I haaaaaaaaaate it.Some people think it makes a house structurally stronger but this is bunk unless the plaster is absolutely pristine and even then I donü__t know if that theory holds water.  For flame retardation, it makes sense to think that something cementious is better than gypsum wrapped in paper, but keep in mind that that something cementious is backed by a pile of kindling, so Iü__m not even sure where we land on that.Sound attenuation is one thing that plaster definitely has going for it, but if you plan on farting in the bathtub fiberglassü__ll do a treat nicer underneath it than a plaster ceiling.  And plasterü__s effect on your r-value is negligible.  Youü__re *much* better off with batt insulation in that regard.  And blown in is fine, sure... but once again, if you have to do any work on your house and it involves ripping out a wall with blown in inside it, youü__ll have an unholy mess on your hands.Clearly I am biased, and this comes from years in the construction industry having to work around plaster.  If you need to cut a clean line in a plaster ceiling, your *best* option is using a grinder with a diamond wheel and having a helper hold a vacuum up to it.  And if thatü__s the best option for cutting a thing, I just donü__t want that thing in my house."

"When you run the AC, condensation forms as part of the process. This is normal. To deal with that condensation, the HVAC unit has a condensate drain pipe that allows the moisture to drain somewhere safe where it cannot do any harm, usually at the outside in the yard or into a gutter. A common issue is that this condensate drain pipe gets clogged for whatever reason. If the pipe is clogged, the condensate can no longer flow to the outside so it must go somewhere else. It backs up in the HVAC unit where it overflows the drain pan and then finds another way out, meaning it leaks out of the unit somewhere else. Your HVAC unit has a float switch as a backup. It's the white L-shaped device with the two black wires coming out of it. This switch is installed slightly higher than the condensate drain. If the condensate cannot drain and backs up, it eventually reaches the float switch and activates it. When the switch gets activated this way, it shuts down the HVAC unit so it stops producing condensation and alert you to the fact that something is wrong. In your case, it seems that either the float switch is not working as intended (broken or installed incorrectly), or condensation managed to find a way out of the unit without tripping the float switch. Either way, this is bad and should not be happening. There should never ever condensation leaking out of the HVAC unit like that. It causes moisture damage to the drywall and framing, and eventually leads to mold and expensive repairs and mitigation. The enclosed area under your HVAC unit is called the air return. Air from the house is sucked through the air filter into the HVAC unit to be heated or cooled. There should never be moisture in the air return. The hole in the bottom of the air return is not a drain hole. Not sure what that is. It might be a duct for another air return somewhere else in the house, or it could be a fresh air supply from the outside to prevent negative pressure inside the house. What you need to do here (today - not tomorrow, next week, or next month) is:1) Shut off the AC so it stops producing condensation.  2) Call a qualified licensed HVAC professional to service the unit. He should blow out the main condensate drain line to ensure it is clear and verify that it can drain properly to the exterior. He should test the float switch and find out why it did not shut off the unit automatically to prevent this leak. He should check the inside of the unit for any damage or additional issues and service as needed.  3) Dry out the entire area with towels and fans etc. and check where else the moisture might have gone. Make sure that it did not get into the walls or other places and make sure there is no mold growing somewhere in that vicinity. It looks like the wood has had moisture damage and there are some dark spots that could be mold. If the HVAC unit is located inside the house, you might want to consult with a qualified water damage specialist to have this mitigated properly.  4) Put a reminder on your calendar to visually inspect the area on a regular basis to ensure there is no more leakage. Also put a reminder on your calendar to have a qualified HVAC professional service the unit twice a year - once in the spring before it gets hot and once in the fall before it gets cold. Hope this helps.

"6 years of cleaning the house, open windows in good weather and routine changing of the furnace filter so you've reduced the particulates but the next spring cleaning get a vacuum with a hepa filter, throw open the windows and vacuum everything...even the ceilings."
"All things being equal if you buy from an appliance store that does service, you'll likely get much better service from them when needed. Service calls for thier customers tend to be prioritized over others. I'd pay slightly more for that aspect but not a lot more."
"Batch series can have quite some variance between them.This is why it's always good to keep some spare leftovers from an install in case of future fix ups.edit: Also, no, a sealing/coating product won't help as there's already a wear layer existing on laminate."
"Can you post some info/pics of the grading project?  I am preparing to modify the grade against my house and am trying to learn as much as I can first.  I would love to see how you went about it.  Also, your front lawn must be a beast to mow the way it is sloped!"
"Dawn dish soap in warm water with a rag for the scrubdown, and a squeegee to finish. Try not to lift the squeegee off the window at all when youü__re using it. I use a short squirt of soap for about half a gallon of water. Windex is for indoors and spot cleaning."
"Deck Jack's maybe? They're probably not suitable for what you want, would need more information. They can come in grid pattern/support layout. To be honest, they're not easy to use. We actually charge more despite not having to mess around with grout/adhesive etc. "
"First time I've ever heard of backer rod - from a quick google, it looks to be just what I would need to ""fill the gap"" before applying caulk/mortar/whatever.  Is that essentially the main purpose of backer rod for this application?  The gap/cracks are very deep.  "

Honestly give the DIY a shot. I'm not an expert by any means but a shed is pretty easy and a good place to start. I'm building a chicken coop (shed with extra doors) mostly from books and my family (contractors etc) seem to think it's gonna last at least 20 years. 
"Honestly, anyone can, and some do, claim to be an expert on Reddit.  It's getting to a point where I hardly waste my time anymore on Redditors who appear to get a kick out of challenging people when they themselves have no expertise whatsoever except the art of BS."
I believe this morning have been when the bathtub faucet was leaking which was fixed a while back. I noticed the boils a few months back but recently went up to examine it. I didn't feel any moisture and the size hasn't grown. Is there anything else I should check?
"I don't think glue alone would hold up the stainless. Stainless steel expands quite a bit with heat. A few cycles of heating up the stove would probably pop glue loose.You may have to get creative. Or talk to the sheet metal people and see if they have any ideas."
"I have the exact one he linked from harborfreight and it's been fantastic so far.  Anything like this where it's just a simple motor and a switch, HF tools are probably good enough for most DIY projects.  If you need a precision cut for fine woodworking, maybe not."
"I just helped a friend with some awful textured walls... we sanded them with a belt sander, and then skim coated, and THEN applied textured paintable wallpaper.  They look pretty good.  If you have the ability to replace the drywall, just do it... it will be easier"
"I think as long as youü__re careful and take it as seriously as you have so far, itü__ll be ok. Even if you do nick the stub out, itü__s not the end of the world. Usually you have access to replace a tub filler and shower mixer valve from the inside of a closet. "
"I'm in the UK and not handy at all I'm afraid, we're going to have to hire people for every stage. We just aren't really sure which order to do them in, cause if we get the floor done first then we risk getting paint on it when we decorate? Is there a proper order?"
"I've got at least 3-4 years on the roof left I'm pretty sure.  I think next year I'm going to go ahead and replace it with a metal roof that will suit the new style much better.  I have been making sure to check up in the attic after every heavy rain, just in case!"
"Is there a switch nearby? Itü__s not uncommon for duplex receptacles to be wired such that one receptacle is controlled by a switch. There is a little tab in the receptacle that you break off to separate the two electrically allowing one to be switch controlled. "
"It's worth noting it's a walkout basement, so insulation will be fairly useful within the space.   Thank you.  This confirms what I thought.  If I ever go forward with this project, I'll take effort to make sure the waste pipes stay inside the insulated envelope."
Jig saws generally arenü__t meant to cut long straight lines they are more like portable scroll saws. Youü__d want a circular or table saw. In any case try clamping a straight edge to the board and using it as your guide. This also works for circular saws as well. 
"Looks great! I would add a wood counter top to go over the tops of the washer and dryer, something to match the color of the window frame. I would have it run the width of the wall so it can double as storage for laundry supplies or a surface for ironing/ folding. "
"Mine runs to a sump pump that shoots it far away from the house, but that's unnecessary.  Some have theirs drip into a floor drain, others into a nearby sink. I would at least recommend you route it so that it's dripping to downspout extender away from your house. "
"My well water ate through our 1970 copper pipes.  Patched several leaks in the last few years.  Getting ready to redo the second floor, did the first floor in PEX already.  Plan to do most of the work and permitting with some help from bro in law who's a plumber.  "
"No offence meant, but that's honestly a stupid idea. You will spend much more money, and have many more headaches anchoring this thing into the ceiling joists, and installing it. It will not look aesthetically pleasing.Buy step ladder for $50 and be done with it."
"Not an expert-- Getting a deck off grade is good to reduce bug and water damage.  Not needing a handrail is good. I wouldn't want more than a single step out the door.   If you don't have gutters, consider how water will splash on to the doorframe (and rot it out)"
"PVC is allowed for cold water lines in California, although there are many local bureaus with their own set of codes they enforce.Everyone adopts what are called model codes written by large private organizations. They may use them wholesale, or amend them a bit."
"Same here. I have the dreaded polybutylene for most of my main runs, and I've had multiple major leaks from the copper stubs to the fixtures due to corrosion (replaced it all after a big one). Never a problem with the PB. It's certainly not a guarantee of success."
"See, that one I can understand. Like maybe they thought someone would want the disposal in the future. As long the wires are terminated correctly and preferably something identifying what that switch is for.I'm assuming that's allowed, but I'm not an electrician."
"Technically speaking your kitchen should have 2, 20 amp dedicated circuits. Then lights on their own, I usually do 10 lights on 1, 15 amp circuit. If it's old though it doesn't matter just make your old stuff work, but if you're pulling new follow what I just said."
"Thank you. Could it be a build up issue? If so how do I clean it?It does seem to smell worse on colder days &amp; new season start ups. It usually doesn't smell much but toward the end of winter 2017 it was very noticable.I wish i could film the smell for you. "
Thanks very much for your informative and detailed reply. I might end up going with a white oak with the oiling option at least for the bar top.  If I can achieve a similar finish with the varnish I might use that on the vertically hung side skirting. Thanks again.
"That may sound extreme, but my idea is to 90 the tub. Move the toilet behind the door and put the sink on the opposite wall. This way, when opening the door, your view will be unobstructed, seeing only the tub and the window. But thatü__s not the cheapest option..."
"The building inspector is employed by the municipal authorities in your area, such as your county or parish. They are charged with inspecting the developer's work, to verify that the building is constructed to local codes.  Search for them in your area on the 'Net."
The walls wider than two feet is what is confusing me. There is a 26ü_ù gap from the door to the next wall which would have an outlet 44ü_ù from the corner. On the other side of the of the door there would be an outlet 110ü_ù total from the one on the adjacent wall
"To add to the other great comments, give them a good yelp/google reviews/whatever review and tell your friends. As a tradesmen your rep carries a lot of weight, and word of mouth is always the most effective marketing. Also maybe offer to be a reference if need be?"
"We bought Mohawk engineered flooring. The cabin grade was almost unusable. We then bought some of the regular grade, which still had a lot of defects considering how much more it cost. That said, itü__s down and we like it, but Iü__ll buy something else next time. "
"We used that technique several times to move a shed around the yard. Works like a charm. When we needed to move the tub, the terrain want particularly accommodating, so we lifted. I personally don't plan on moving it again anytime soon... Or ever, if I can help it."
"When I bought my home I had the air ducts cleaned. They were filthy from 23 years of use without proper maintenance on the furnace filter. I Paid $350 and they did a good job, so your quote seems a tad high to me. But it could also be a matter of square footage too"
"Whos giving these quotes? I realize LA is expensive but I did my roof in metal for 13k and my house was huge. If the extra labor to peel off 2 additional layers is 20k, then I'd just do it myself for the cost of 2 dumpsters and a couple cases of beer with friends. "
"Ya they did. I really don't want to put up with another winter without proper insulation. This way they'll be able to get every little nook and cranny and they said they'll make it 5"" thick. My understanding is that 2"" is standard. So....ya - ceiling is coming off."
"Yeah, I ran a quick calculation and unless I paid up front it would take forever to ""make"" money on the system and by then it would probably need to be replaced or constantly repaired due to age.Plus I would need to do a roof first since it's way past it's prime."
"Yeah... I just gave up and bought a sealed box or two of every bolt/washer/nut combination I could imagine I would ever need.It's pricey up front, and irritating when I'm at the store and don't remember what I already have, but at least I always have what I need."
"Yes they do, but a single residential  system cannot deliver offset temps to each floor, without additional hardware being incorporated.  For O.P., this would require, at the very minimum, the installation of motorized dampers in the trunk lines serving each floor."
"Yes, generally that is enough info.If this is just a regular driveway pad, you only need a standard 4"" depth pad, especially with 4500psi mix. Anything deeper than that is overkill for regular passenger vehicles.Double check their license/ins/bond with the CCB."
"You can use oil based paint, though it is much better to use primer after sanding. Many  [Interior designers in Kolkata](https://bestluxuryinteriors.com/) recommends only sanding, as it will cost you less money and the difference in final result is not much differ."
"You have absolutely no way of knowing if sistering would be acceptable or not.We do not know enough of the situation to be able to tell that. OP, find a framer or general contractor and have this done right.  Otherwise youü__ll be throwing good money after bad."
"big box stores sell shed kits, the one issue will be the foundation part as you will need to drive the tractor into the space.  Another item is to check your local zoning and building codes/ordinances first as to what can be done with a shed and the need of permits"

"&gt;I want to go with a vessel sink, which shouldn't necessitate a marble counter?Counter material is down to personal preference. The type of sink you're using doesn't really play into it. You can mount a vessel sink on marble, granite, quartz, tile, wood, laminate, corian, etc. - whatever you want. I imagine if you were seeing vanities in the $1300-$2500 range, you were probably looking at ones with high-end materials. Lower-end materials would certainly reduce costs, both for off-the-shelf &amp; custom work. "
"Best of luck to you.An additional resource for you may be /r/centuryhomes.

"Ditto the heated mattress pad. I love on the north coast and damp cold is a cold unlike any other. I turn mine on a few minutes before I get into bed to warm it up, then depending on how cold it is, I turn it off before I go to sleep. But I do understand about a freezing room, thatü__s not pleasant to wake up to and get ready for your day. I would suggest the mattress pad as a stop gap and a savings plan for a proper heating/venting system? I should have asked, you own this condo? If you said, I missed that, sorry. "
"Do you have a barrier on the walls of the crawlspace? If not, adding that 20% won't make any material change. If they are covered, on the other hand, then absolutely. You can purchase a smaller roll of a thick'ish barrier and use the tape they sell for the seams. It can all be found by searching for crawlspace encapsulation supplies. Also, be careful of the sheets with reinforcing mesh. Those are the ones that smell like cat-pee if the mesh is ever exposed to air. There are several blog posts and videos about it. "
"Everybody else already answered the question, it's a fire block, just drill through it. Part two answer is don't be a pussy, just run power through there, it won't hurt a thing.Now let me give you some real advice: watch a couple YouTube videos on patching drywall, then cut a big fucking 16x16 hole in that SOB and you'd already be done by now. Stop dicking around with 2"" holes. It's easier to patch a four foot hole than a 2"" hole. Once you can patch drywall, you will truly be a diy master, and we will bow to you. "
"Gotcha. I'm a little bit of a stickler for being as specific as I can when it comes to linking products on this sub. After all, people are here because they're not 100% sure what they're doing and trying to sort it out... I just operate under the assumption they're gonna click the Amazon link and put it right in their cart or run to the hardware store and show someone who works there the picture of the product on their phone. I couldn't even tell you how many times I've used the phrase, ""Kilz - the **red** can"" haha"
"I didn't saying anything about throwing a system away in 10 years. I'm saying after 30 years it's not going to meet your needs unless you size it 40% above your needs when you buy, which is crazy.And FYI, future systems aren't dropping 20%. Prices have dropped 60% over the last decade. Project that over the 30 year life of your system, and at that 30 year mark you are almost certainly better off getting a new system vs spending thousands of dollars to replace micro inverters that are 5-10 years beyond end of life."
"I have concrete countertops that the previous owner had installed. They are very nice and I'm sure they weren't a DIY.I've wanted to try my hand at this, and have watched a number of videos. One of the things I haven't seen is anyone using a vacuum pump after vibrating to try to draw out all the bubbles (since that seems to be one of the biggest issues that people have). I think it may also prevent the need for a lot of sanding.If it were me, I'd practice a bunch. Small scale to try to get everything just right."
"I really wish I didnü__t have such a terrible fear of spiders, because home inspections is one of those things that I *know* I would excel at. Iü__d love to do it for awhile, but crawling through crawl spaces just creeps me out. So many damn spiders! Iü__m odd in that I would actually enjoy being able to pop in headphones and a podcast and justSpend hours closely inspecting and criticizing a building, looking for any sneakiness I can find! Itü__s sad that some inspectors are such shit.

"If you transition to hardwood there are transition beads that will be part of the hardwood flooring system, they generally sit over the tile trims.As for the tack strip wearing out the carpet, on older carpet it can wear through eventually but at that stage the carpet is shot and needs replacing anyway.You can hire a knee kicker or pick up a basic one on Amazon rather cheaply. Hand stretching won't last.Or offer a box of beers and $30-40 to a carpet layer if you can find one locally, it'll take them 5 minutes "
"It depends, honestly.  Does this room have tall/vaulted ceilings?  Both directions get air mixing to evenly distribute it, but the benefit to the 'summer' direction [is to create a breeze by having it blow straight down.](https://static.hansenwholesale.com/media/wysiwyg/haiku/fan-direction/ceilingfandirection.gif)  A breeze isn't exactly what you want in winter to stay warm.  If you're unable to reverse the direction of the fan, I would try it on low and see if it makes a difference to you, if not, just turn it off."
"It's up to code surprisingly, I didn't believe it myself since my shop always does a minimum of 18"", so when I bought the house I did my own plumbing inspection and found a break in the sewer and when dug up i noticed a leak on the waterline so it was replaced and inspected along with the sewer and all passed by the county (unincorporated so no city inspection)  What trips me out more is my sewer line takes two 45s and runs parallel with the street and doesn't connect until the it gets to the cross street.  "
"Iü__m not a health professional so Iü__m not an expert,  but you could very well have had an unusual presentation. The headache, high fever, skin/joint pain, and runny nose are common for influenza. I mentioned it because the vomiting and diarrhea arenü__t typical, and it sounded like those were the only symptoms you had - not to downplay them, because they truly sound awful.

"Thanks.  I would use an electrician for anything more than simple wiring.  Iü__m not sure I trust myself to not screw it up.  For the two bedroom solutions you posted, it sounds like it would only be minor drywall repair to the area with the new box unless the fan covered it completely, but nothing in the wall?  Is that correct?Do they make any ceiling fans that are controlled via remote only?  That would at least solve the wall issue on the first floor, although I donü__t know how you get power.  Hmmm,Thanks!"
"That's just to distract from the ones that are laminate. ""At least its not laminate!  I bought solid wood."" There are many levels of idiocy and maybe you're not totally susceptible to marketing shenanigans of making sure the details stay with the devil. It should say walnut veneer right at the top, not hidden behind click. Same with the 'solid oak' should say whether its red oak vs white oak.  Red oak is porous, not suitable for a countertop where food is prepped, white oak is non-porous, they build boats out of it."
"You need the right tool for the job. Rent or borrow an air compressor that will run 100 lbs. Next, rent a nail gun called a ""coil nailer"" with a ""flush nail tip"". It has nails rolled up into a ball. You only need a few coils, so call around to some roofers or roofing suppliers and buy say 5 coils of 1-1/2"" galvanized, zinc coated, or stainless coil nails. This will save quite a bit on cost if you dont have to buy a case. You are fighting bounce by hand nailing when a gun would be like ""boom, done, next"". Good luck. "
"Ask if you can call a plumber out, pay the plumber, and take that money out of rent payments, ensure you get that in writing.  Same goes with the rodents.  See if you can hire an exterminator or specialist to determine where they are getting in, and take the money you paid out of rent.  If they refuse this then state the living conditions of leaking water is unacceptable and it needs to be fixed.  Threatening though, could get you kicked out, depending on how the paperwork was originally worded, and then they will just do this to the next person.  However getting a third party involved, might remedy the issue, but still might get you kicked out with them being vindictive. If they refuse for the rodents, then trap them and try to find holes and buy some steel wool. "
"Don't insulate your walls.  That's not where you're losing heat and insulating will just create moisture problems down the road.  Air seal.  Get a caulk gun and seal cracks at the windows, baseboards, etc.   Use rope caulk like Mortite around exterior doors and windows that you plan to have closed until spring. Make sure your exterior door sweeps are working and put weather stripping around.  In an old house, you probably won't have an open concept layout.  Use all those doors to close off rooms that are colder from the areas of the house you spend the most time in.  Rugs and thick curtains help.If you have steam radiators, make sure the valve are clean and the radiators are pitched correctly.  Make sure your attic entrance is sealed properly.   "
"That's great idea for the occasional tools. I will do that for a tile saw, and maybe now that you mentioned it a small compressor once I have the space. I am bit constrained on space until I build my shed/workshop (which can only be built after the yard is renovated), so I was trying to avoid buying a compressor. I wanted cordless nailers because I didn't want to grad a compressor and hose around. I have fence and siding projects that would be more convenient sans airtools. Those are very interesting horses and could be my choice if I cant find what I am looking for. The ones I am thinking of can have a horisontal 2X4 where the ""Toughbuilt"" metal piece is along the top of the horses you lists. Thanks for the great response! I really appreciate your suggestions."
"HVAC tech here. The safety is designed to cut power from your system in the event that it fails, but yes, you can run it without the safety.If you want to hook it up (which I'd recommend)1. Turn off power to your furnace/air handler (there may be a light switch on the side or just kill it at the breaker)2. Take the door off your furnace/air handler and find the control board and low voltage terminals3. Remove the wire going to the R terminal (should be red, but the ""standard"" isn't always followed.4. Take one wire from your pump and wire nut it to the R wire coming from your thermostat.5. Take the other wire from your pump and attach it to the R terminal on the control board.Basically what you're doing is requiring the 24v to run through the pump before it makes it to the control board. So if the pump fails the signal will not make it to the board and nothing will run therefore preventing further operation when you have no way to remove the condensation.Feel free to shoot me a PM if you have any questions."
"I see nobody has really commented on this specifically so..You might want to consider running cement board underlayment over the plywood, then applying a new waterproofing membrane (following manufacturer spec and/or TCNA guidelines where spec is vague or non-existent). Your existing old membrane is likely damaged during uplift (i.e no longer a continuous membrane) and to repair is to re-do. Further, it's so exceptionally thin that you can see the patterns on the ply underneath so I'd suspect it's not even up to spec in terms of thickness. If you're having issues with height then instead of CBU you could consider a product I've seen u/rahchachaNY suggest recently which is Greenskin underlayment (might want to specifically ask him questions about it - my knowledge is exceptionally limited for that product). Further, before even looking at that double check that your deflection is up to spec prior to considering re-tiling.And if you're on second floor or higher, **do not skimp on your waterproofing or cut corners**."
"Got it to finally work so hopefully this will help someone in the future...When we turn the wall switch on it clicks then stops or just keeps clicking without lighting. Turns out the pilot went out because we keep the red knob (under the fireplace) off when not in use. I tried a bunch of things to get it working but ultimately hereü__s how I got it to light again. Keep in mind, do this at your own risk. Turn the wall switch off. If you have glass in front of your fireplace, open it so gas doesnü__t get trapped in there while doing the below steps. Take off the front panel beneath the fireplace and locate the red button/lever. Slide it to the right then press and hold it in for about 30-60 seconds to purge and release gas. Then slide the red lever all the way to the left (OFF). Flip the wall switch to ON and you should hear some clicks. Even if the clicking stops after a few seconds, sit tight for about 5 minutes and the clicking will start up again on its own and keep clicking nonstop. I think this has to do with the pilot sensing enough gas to finally light. When you hear the clicking, turn the red lever all the way to the right (ON) and give it a few seconds and the fireplace should come on. Took me a few times to get it working but worth a shot. Hope this helps!"
"I used to work in a forensic engineering company.We did a lot of water loss accidents.  Not one of them was ever copper.  I had hundreds of cases, not one was copper.I'm talking about hundreds of cases and many over $1M.  If you ruin 4000sq ft of Brazilian rosewood floors, and the threes floors under it, you get really pricey.  Also no one will insure you after a water loss accident like that, because of mold.  You have to gut the entire thing and build new.  No insurer will sign off on a place with a water loss unless it's gutted.  Again, mold.The losses we did have were always PEX, and it was always the fittings. There was a class action thing years ago about some company and their fittings. The company said the installers did it wrong.  I think it was 80% fittings and 20% installers.  We tested the fittings, we had a metallurgy lab, most were awful.For me as a homeowner it does not matter if the failing is in the fittings or the installation.  I will choose copper every time.  It will last 50-75 years and I will never think about it.If it's PEX I have to think about how each thing was crimped, and each fitting not being lead contaminated brass which WILL fail, like the hundreds of cases I actually saw with my own eyes.I would always go copper over PEX.

"I was under the impression that a fan-rated box would need to have the posts or reinforced ears to support the weight of the fan assembly. I just did the same thing in my daughter's room in my 1950s home where there was already a steel octagon box anchored to a joist-spanning 2x4, and I ended up taking everything apart and putting it back together again (which was no mean feat, I ended up having to go to an electrical supply house to get a fan-rated box with enough knockouts where I needed them) with a fan-rated box.That said, I've also put up a couple other fans in the house without swapping the box (same setup with the 2x4 span) and they haven't fallen down -- yet -- but in the future I think I'm going to continue using the fan boxes just for peace of mind. General opinion here seems to differ from mine though, and is probably from more experience than I have, so YMMV.Edit: I'm talking explicitly about a fan-rated electrical box, not things like the Safe-T-Brace that's built to span the joist in addition to providing a box. I simply swapped a standard 1 1/4"" octagon box with a fan rated one of the same size with sturdier box ears and fastened it to the 2x4 that was already there. As others have said, that's gonna be a more secure connection to the framing anyway."
"USAA paid their engineer team to come out after their original ""typical"" inspector denied my claim.  The engineers wrote the report.  I wasn't happy about it because those engineers, although separate from USAA, were on their payroll.  I did ask for an independent firm to inspect, but USAA wouldn't pay for that.This house was built on a pier &amp; beam foundation in TX, no basement...no concrete slab.  I had tenanats renting the house.  About 15 people were watching the Dallas football game &amp; when they scored toward the end of the game most of the people started jumping around in celebration.   Most of these people were over 200lbs...i was told this by my tenant.  All these people were on the same side of the house.  The outer 2x12 slipped outward &amp; the inner 2x10 slipped inward as they were jumping about, the floor concaved a few inches.  The house abruptly shifted off several piers.Now, I'm not saying a ton+ of fun eff'd up the house alone..it may just been the straw that broke it.The team I hired had to jack up the house, replace those 2 pieces, relevel &amp; tie it all together so it wouldn't happen again.  I got a verified engineer letter stating all is up to code &amp; a lifetime warranty from that hired  compamy as long as they're in business as well."
"Hi milamber84906, thanks once again for your response! It's been incredibly helpful. I haven't made a lot of progress the past few weeks, but you can see some [updates here](https://imgur.com/gallery/Uz4Dpn6). I also have a few more questions I was hoping you might help me out with:1. In the earlier patches where I didn't etch the scratch coat, could I use a bonding agent like [Larsen's Plaster-Weld](http://www.larsenproducts.com/plaster-weld-2/) or this [Quikrete product](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Quikrete-1-Qt-Bonding-Adhesive-990214/100318541)? I'm a little concerned about cracking the scratch coat by going at it with a bottle opener, but maybe I'm being too paranoid.2. Should I spray the brown coat with water before applying the top coat?3. About how much time should I wait before applying the second top coat? Is there a certain consistency I should be looking for? That may be a hard question to answer as I assume it depends a bit on humidity and temperature. If it helps: I live in Pittsburgh PA, so it's getting colder and more dry. We usually keep the house around 68.4. In my dining room, a large chunk of the ceiling around the chandelier had to be removed in order to install an electrical box that could support a chandelier's weight. There's this kind of flower texture that radiates from the center. Here's a picture [before and after](https://imgur.com/gallery/bxnkz3T) demolition began. Have any ideas on how to duplicate a pattern like this? Again, thanks so much for your advice so far. Hope you're well."
"We just bought this house in July. The original part of the house was built in 1958. The owners did a 1100 sq ft addition around 2006 though. So this ü__crawlspaceü_ù is only under the part of the house that was added on. We had a radon inspection done when we purchased the home since we do live in a high risk area. They placed the sensor in our basement for 48 hours and the levels came back as acceptable. Iü__m not at all familiar with the construction of this crawlspace. The interior original basement of our house had several window well openings. Along the backside of the house (where they added on to) the original windows are still there in the foundation but it appears that they have been sealed off and we canü__t really see into the crawlspace. On the outside of what is the ü__newü_ù back of the house, this is where the crawlspace vents are located. There is a total of 5 openings to the crawlspace. 4 vent openings and 1 opening that is a bit larger window. Iü__m not sure if this is maybe supposed to be the crawlspace access? It sure doesnü__t seem like anybody could get in there though unless the whole window was removed from the concrete slab. _˘Æ_˘Æ_˘Æ_˘Æü_çü___ˆè Iü__ll attach some pics. I donü__t want to cause damage to my house or foundation but Iü__m really unfamiliar with what is the right thing to do here. Based on all this information, is it a safer bet to just leave the vents open all year and leave the opening uncovered?https://imgur.com/sp3hPethttps://imgur.com/7doxECRhttps://imgur.com/C8zoSof"

"Is it cleaned by flipping a lever and running a backwash? Or do you have to remove the cartridge and clean it with a hose? Other than a really weird way to deal with a leak, my only guess is it's for some sort of backwash, but I  know more about pools than hot tubs."
It's called aluminum trim capping and you usually fabricate it for the site using an [aluminum brake](https://www.homedepot.com/tool-truck-rental/Aluminum-Brake-10/TM10/). They sell coils of aluminum sheet and you use that tool to bend lengths of it to fit the wood.

"Ok, thanks. I'm planning to tackle it this weekend, so I'm trying to get prepped. Not sure why I'm so nervous to try it--maybe because my husband has always had so many frustrations with it and the stakes seem high (invisible water damage happening behind the wall)."

"Seconded, I just got a faucet and the line running to it replaced, and a new one added where there wasn't one, and new shutoffs on the inside for $400 CAD, took the guy 2hours.  I could have done it myself too, but risk fucking it up and probably takes me 2 days lol"
"Since you have a Tudor-esque house, take a look at Tudor porticos--something with express architecture (exposed beams) would be appropriate to the style of the house even though it's obviously not a 500 year-old house. You'll likely want to match that gable as well."
"So it isnü__t really about the money. I like the look, a specific color, scratch proof (2 dogs), slip proof, waterproof,etc. It also happens to be the cheapest. Weü__ve looked at a lot of other options at this point and it seems like if itü__s not this, itü__s LVP. "
Thanks! I hope others learn to have the right tools for the job before starting a project unlike me. Iü__m not nearly skilled enough to clever with a shortlist of tools. Ordering tools one at a time and Home Depot trips at each road block really delays the project. 
"Thanks.  Sadly, my preference is all over the place!  Tile throughout is very common for Florida.  Given the amount of space, I wasn't sure if tile EVERYWHERE would be overkill...?  If I threw down some wood in the bedrooms, would it clash or is that acceptable?  "
"Thanks. It doesnü__t leak when weü__re using the well, it comes in only when it rains. Iü__m hoping itü__s just because thereü__s nothing plugging that hole that goes right to the underground. The well pipe is one diameter and the hole is a few inches bigger around."
"That looks great! Really makes the kitchen look bright. We have a similar look in our kitchen - the orangey oak cabinets and ceramic tile ü__wood plankü_ù floors. Itü__s not terrible, but itü__s a lot of wood. I would love to get my cabinets painted white some day. "
"There is, but I donü__t know off the top of my head. I think there is a formula based off of how many square feet of attic space you have. You could probably do some Googling and figure it out, or the insulation company should be able to help you figure it out too. "
This is what I came here to say.  I am in the military and have moved consistently every 3-5 years of my career.   I always make sure the house I am leaving has a fresh roll in the bathrooms and that I have a move in day essential box that has toilet paper on top.  
"Time to invest in a real auger or snake.  They don't cost much; the hand powered ones start at around $15 for a 15 footer:https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-1-4-in-x-15-ft-Drum-Auger-82-969-111/301879463Trust me; you will use this several times through the years."
"Totally - best of luck with the floor! Ours are ancient and very lived-in, but honestly, I like it that way. Perfect things are just waiting to be marred. Once you break the seal, it's more about taking care of it and less about preserving that brand new appearance."
"What Rinnai unit? Mine (RUR98IN) has a panel with a power button. Flip that off, and the unit is dead - it won't work headless seemingly.&amp;#x200B;Is each room on its own run and then they have a manifold with solenoids to turn on various rooms that need heat?"
"Wow, how long were those rugs there that the tiles fused to it?  My guess about the originals is they wanted to change and it was cheaper to cover than remove and replace. Personally, I'd pull it all up, check the sub-floor and put down whatever flooring you want."
"Wow. I really appreciate your response, and after reading it a few times, I'm pretty sure i understand it too haha!If any other tips come to mind please let me know. I am handy and have installed a hand-full of interior doors, but the scenario I'm in is a new one!"
"Yeah. I need to clean mine, which basically means removing all the trash left over from a bigger project. Problem is I literally can't get out without assistance, and thus I need to coordinate assistance. Mine isn't suitable for storage or anything, it's just there."
"Yes for sure! Google/YouTube and Reddit have been my go-to for this floor install and changing out a faucet on one of our bathroom sinks. I like ü__busyü_ù work, especially when itü__s something that I can look at everyday and enjoy it and be like ü__I did that!ü_ù."
"Yes, but be careful with this advice if you're new.  The ground wire in the US will often be bare copper, however, the wire carrying power to the outlet will have also been stripped to bare copper where it is terminated.Also, the above is dangerous advice, anyway."
"Yes. 304 and 316 are both more resistant to corrosion and pitting and much less likely to crack along welds over time. Especially when almost all of these mass produced sinks are welded by wire feed, which cracks sooner rarer than later.304 is better, 316 is best."
"You can do a [home kit for $14 + about 5 stamps](http://a.co/d/e2Bg8qh). Freshman science experiment level of difficulty. Cheap peace of mind. If you find a problem mediation is like $1,000. You might have to do it anyway when you sell, might as well not get cancer."
"You can try straight acetone (usually what nail poliah remover is made of) but any real solvent could also cause more damage to the glues and dyes in the flooring and would potentially ve worse than the superglue stains.You could always try sanding the glue flush "
"You'll be there all year trying to sand a floor that far gone. If the wood is soft enough to sink your nail into, it will just make an uneven mess. Either treat it (to prevent further rotting) and cover with a new surface, or rip up and replace. Looks like old pine."
"Youü__ve read my mind about the flat head screws. I was thinking that Iü__ve not seen them attaching to a hoist before. After I closed the box, I had the novel idea to undo one of them and see what it was attached to. Guess I will get back up there and check it out."

"&gt; it's just an aesthetic thing because they will end up looking different as they age.I feel that pressure treated for the posts is kind of required as they are in contact with the ground.  I also don't mind them looking a bit different than the pickets because I want them to stand out, so I'll be staining them a bit darker.My biggest concern at this point is price; I'm doing it myself so I can save on labor and upgrade to cedar pickets, so if I can do pressure treated rails that will be a significant savings."
"&gt;but that doesnt mean it couldnt cost less than it is worth, and they just didnt want to be bothered.Sure, it doesn't rule out that possibility.  But if I was a gambling man, I'd put my money on 'cost more than it was worth' every. single. time.  The very fact the OP is here debating whether or not to purchase ""a charming home in an ideal neighborhood' is why.

"I aim to please.I'm now wondering if OP meant, he's going to tie the Ethernet to the coax **along with** fish tape, so as to give some rigidity to the push side, while pulling from the other end.

"I can't find anything credible saying it's safe to ride in a car. &gt;unless I find some sort of official document that says, ""Yes, it's fine to burn things overnight in a fireplace INSERT"".Look for something that is **UL listed** and also get a carbon monoxide detector.

It is cheaper to turn it off in the summer and on in the autumn. When we call to activate the service, they send someone to look at the furnace each time."
"What type of interior work? The prices on roofing have gone up four times this year, which has changed pricing drastically. Iü__ve been surprised to see roofs that were 7k last year have turned to about 12k this year. It also depends on the type of shingle too. It also depends on other work that may have needed done like new plywood for certain boards, or several boards, things like that come up and add up quickly. I estimate for a roofing company.It is weird they wouldnü__t give you a number first though...

"&gt;I should set 72 for upstairs and 68 for downstairs (keep a 2 degree difference).That's technically a 4-degree difference. The article recommends a 2-degree gradient between the set temps of the units. So if you want 70, set one to 69 and the other to 71. They're argument about thermal convection is technically right, but in reality it's splitting hairs. You're never going to get uniform blending of air in a house, especially when the thermostat itself only monitors a relatively small area for temperature. The Nest app shows usage history, so do an experiment. Run both tstats at the same setpoint for a week or two to see how different the run times are. If they're very different, adjust the setpoints until you get roughly the same usage upstairs &amp; down.  "
"Agree. More maintenance on a tankless if you have hard water. The tankless are typically very reliable, but if you need a repair $$$. You can get an extra anode installed up front if you want the extended warranty on the Rheem tank type. Plus they have the self cleaning dip tubes design available. I have a modern insulated tank type.  I can shut my main water off (seen to many flooded houses - just a precaution) and turn the water tank off  to when I leave town. 4 or 5 days without heating the water. Still hot enough to take a shower. The modern tanks have improved greatly if you get the right model. Fraction of the cost for a tankless. The only real advantage of a tankless is if you want endless hot water. Like say you have a house full of teenagers or high usage. "
"Carpenter here. I ended up buying a shed kit from Home Depot  as it was much cheaper than purchasing the material on my own. Siding was much better than what I could purchase at Home Depot, but studs were 24ü_ù on center instead of 16ü_ù on center. I poured a slab and had to purchase asphalt shingles and paint beyond the kit. This was about 8 years ago but I bought the 10ü__ x 12ü__ barn style kit for about $1000. Although I could have designed and built the shed on my own, for cost, time and quality the shed kit couldnü__t be beat. Over time I added a second floor, insulation and peg board and through my job was able to salvage cabinetry from a demo job.Tl;dr Buy a shed kit from Home Depot (or somewhere else) as quality is good, and it will save you time and money."
"First thing , do not go electric in NH , your bill in January can be as high as $3000.00 , itü__s the most expensive way to heat a home . Oil is a safe reliable heat , the boiler can be cleaned out and tuned up to provide you with clean efficient heating .

"I don't think Prime Visa is that hard to get, personally.  And it's free if you've got Prime.The Sapphire products have a bit of a higher credit rating requirement, and an annual fee...the Preferred is $95 and waived the first year.The Reseve is $450 and not waived -- but $300 of that gets back to you as statement credits for the loosely defined ""travel"" catagory -- that also includes parking and transit passes. And bonus perks you can use in the first year (like PreCheck/GlobalEntry application credit, lounge access for a good number of airports where it's quiet and there's free snacks and drinks, etc) can make up for a bit of the remainder.  Both have a sign-on bonus that, if you make the minimum spend, overshadows the AF anyway. ^(Referal links in my profile)"
"My house was horrible the first few winters. The furnace was old and crappy. The windows were drafty. And there was absolutely nothing between the outside wall and the plaster walls. I slept at night in my winter coat with the furnace on blast.When I gutted the plaster there were holes and gaps on the outside boards (the old shiplap exterior) so the inside of my exterior walls (no insulation) were essentially the same temp as outside. And plaster is a great conductor of cold. Even with the horse hair inside the plaster. So my walls kept my house freezing. It was just an amazing turn around with the insulation. But ideally your attic insulation is one of the most important to insulate.Plaster sucks for many reasons, but in cold Michigan winters it's really bad."
"Sorry, but I do belitte jobs that serve no purpose but to leech off other people's labor.

"They're ceramic and going on plywood, which to my understanding means they're not sitting on a dead flat surface. Contractor's excuse is the house was build that way 15 years ago so they're just re-doing it since building code doesn't require cement board or a membrane of some sort. If we want it done right, they're going to charge us more for it and we're trying to argue that he should've disclosed this shitty plan before accepting a down payment instead of assuming the client's too stupid to catch on. Unfortunately I think getting money back via insurance or a bond would require a lawyer, which would be more money down the hole. They did not provide a proper contract, just an invoice confirming the homeowner paid the deposit.Thank you for the details you provided."
"/u/AbsolutelyPink is on the money with her answers, but I thought I'd add just a bit to it.It is fairly normal for an older house to have used 1.5"" galvanized pipe for the washing machine.  Back in the day the machines were smaller, and discharged water slower, than the extra capacity units that are common today.  If you have a big unit you may see the water backing up on you through the standpipe.

"Not familiar with those particular hinges but adjusting height is not your issue. Your top hinge needs to be pulled tighter to the jamb.One way to do it is to open the door just enough to access the jamb hinge screws. Shim under the door tightly to support it's weight/lift the handle side. Replace the screw closest to the center of the jamb with a 3"" ? screw [or one 1"" longer than the existing if the screw is already 3"" long].Lean strong into the screw while driving it into the framing behind the jamb.  It is possible to overdo it so you may need to adjust after the fact by slightly loosening the screw.If your hinge will adjust depth? Try supporting the weight of the door by shimming before adjustingIf your long screw doesn't help? You can remove the top hinge and chisel the jamb pocket deeper or remove the bottom hinge and shim the hinge away from the jamb [you already have a large gap at the hinge side so this may be ineffective]edit one type of adjustable hingehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bcHqfR2Pwo"
"This is 100% ***NOT*** the correct way to do this, in case anyone other than OP is wondering (since OP already got it figured out).    First off, OP's house exterior is brick. Natural, seasonal expansion and contraction of the wood part of the wall is going to cause the threaded rod/mounting bolts that go ***completely*** through the wall to the outside to cause the brick and/grout to crack. Once it cracks, it's no longer waterproof. Only someone who wanted to cause water infiltration and rot behind the brick would do it that way. It is insane what people convince themselves and try to convince others is the correct way to do something.    Second, metal rod will conduct heat and cold through the wall, which could potentially cause condensation ***inside*** the wall itself.    What u/firematt422 proposes and u/ZeikCallaway backs up is moronic unless you live in a trailer/inexpensive house and you don't give a feck how badly you screw up your walls.    Save yourself a lifetime of headaches and don't be like them."
"Make sure all your vents are open and getting airflow. Strategically scatter car air freshness on the outgoing vents throughout the house. Super convenient, low maintenance, and in my opinion car air freshness tend to be less likely to build up to that overwhelming perfumey smell. I'm not a big fan of scented candles for their smells. Don't get me wrong: I love the aesthetics of a candle lit room and the nice smell for the next couple hours. But it seems like high risk low reward for its scent abilities. The actual smell is pretty faint unless the candle is actively burning and it only lingers for another hour or two. Especially in a house with younger kids, I feel like needing to have mini fires constantly going is not the best strategy. I would check your specific model before doing it, but you can add some essential oil to a lot of humidifiers and basically have an industrial strength diffuser. Personally I'm a lazy bones so if it requires me to do it more than once a week, it's pretty unlikely I'm gonna do it. I love set it and forget it scent stuff cause then it's like a pleasant surprise for yourself. Like you walk into your house after a long day and your like ""oh yum, what nice unexpected sensory input greeting me at the front door!""Also- try to rotate between scents after a while. an easy way to keep the rhythm is to have different scents for different reasons (even if it's not a ""seasonal"" scent). It helps cut down on the nose fatigue where you need more and more to be aware of the smell being present. "
"I wouldn't even bother getting it tested (has implications down the line). I'm 99.99% positive it's asbestos, treat it as such.If it's lifting off the surface without breaking it that part either needs to come off or be encapsulated with a secured down product (e.g ply) or something along the lines of fibre reinforced self leveler in combination with a primer for non-porous surfaces.It *can* be DIY removed relatively safely (it's a pain to set up a proper negative air pressure environment, so while it's an ideal thing to do to basically remove exposure risk, it's not something most DIYers would do), it's not the end of the world (neither is the fact you've already done a bit - it's generally 2-4% chrysotile in these backings, so unless the backing is sanded exposure *is* limited), just take care. If you are going to DIY the rest of the removal then let me know so I can steer you in the right direction.Interlocking LVT needs a floor with minimal height variation under it. You *could* skim it but it's one of the few situations where I'd say it's easier to just use a *self smoother* (so you can feather up to the same height as the edge) provided the floor is close to level.Glue down basically just requires a smooth floor, but you'll feel anything underneath telegraph through.If height transitions aren't a major issue, I'd recommend securing a new sheet of 1/4 ply over top then laying over that.Also, in that pic, it looks like floating floors in the room to the right but from a glance I'd say that type of bar is incorrect - you ideally want some space under the transition for expansion/contraction. If that was subbed out and you ever have issues with your existing flooring there buckling and/or gapping, it's an installation failure (no recourse with manufacturer)."

I would be more concerned about why there is such a big difference in temperatures. Have you accidentally blocked off the heat vent or covered a radiator in your bedroom? If you can't figure out why the heat is so uneven I would contact the landlord about that issue.

Holding the right side with a pair of pliers and hitting the left side might work out.The screws that hold it together are about a half inch long and the head is on the outside of the box, they are tough to adjust once the box is in the wall.[this is similar to what the box looks like.](https://www.gescan.com/products/boxes-covers/t-b-iberville-bc1104-4229)"
"&gt; From my understanding, the foil faced stuff is legal to leave exposed. If it will be for longer than a few months it might be a better thing to use.I don't understand why this myth is so popular... the foil has no special relevance in the code at all, and as far as I know it never has. All foam plastic insulation needs a fire barrier (or ignition barrier in crawlspaces/attics), unless it has been tested and approved to be left exposed, like Dow Thermax and competitor products that have passed the NFPA 286 test."
"&gt; Strange to have a gas-fired water heater with both a control box with LED and a standing pilot.Is that right? My water heater is only a few years old, but it matches OP's description dead on. It's got a Honeywell t-stat like this with a status LED. https://i1.wp.com/learnbyblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Honeywell-Module-300x298-1.pngMaybe I'm just not following.

"A lot of spiders are a symptom, not a problem. If you have a lot of spiders, it means they have a lot of bugs to eat to sustain their population. Seal up around your foundation, doors, and windows with expanding foam and caulk (a cheap infrared thermometer can help you find spots outside air is coming in), make sure all shrubs and foliage are trimmed so that nothing is in contact with the house, and apply a perimeter treatment of bifenthrin. Otherwise, just put masking tape over the hole until you patch it properly."
"I bought seating furniture from them. It came in like 4-5 large boxes so they had a courier drop it off instead of UPS/FedEx. Assembling was a matter of connecting the pieces together. The boxes were average weight. I was able to move it on my own, but having another person definitely made it easier. I ended up returning it as I didn't end up liking it. The return process was so easy. The courier came and picked it up as is. I didn't need to disassemble or repack or anything. I just had to eat the courier fee of ~$75."
"If you are only planning to stay in the property for the next 2 years I'd consider buying higher end late model used appliances from craigslist.  I bought a used Bosch dishwasher for $50, a used Frigidaire Professional Series Over the Range Microwave for $70, a used Jenn Aire fridge for $60 and a used Frigidaire range for $100 - all of them in stainless. Full disclosure: the range was less than the quality I wanted but my wife got tired of looking.You can find GREAT deals on craigslist, you just can't be in a hurry."
"It seems to be the loops/pile are compressed and raised. It isn't the backing. You can tell because where it's raised your feet spring on the loops and it is flat/compressed in the low spots.It sounds like that's a good thing in this instance... It will fluff back up I hope.I'm a bit too nervous to use the steam thing but it sounds like it would work.It's pretty dry these days and house pumping forced air. Would putting humidifiers nearby work at all? Doing it anyway for airn quality but maybe it'll help carpet."
"Thanks for the suggestion, I'd love to get rid of the cabinet altogether, so filling the hole and adding sister gussets sounds like a good option.&amp;#x200B;I'm really curious if there's something behind the insulation on the exterior wall that made the builders decide to re-route the exhaust pipe. If not (hurray!), I'm wondering if they added the exterior vent before seeing where the stove vent would rest?&amp;#x200B;Anyways, I'll probably need to remove the internal cabinet before I can reach back that far."

"Yes- any valve partially turned will restrict flow. By how much- hard to guess. The first turn back from fully open tends not to restrict a lot of flow since pressure is high and the ü__holeü__ the water flows through isnü__t that much smaller. You get much more effect the closer to fully closed you go. What specifically is your problem? Low flow? If so, and itü__s also from the cold side, your invoking water pressure may be low. If itü__s just the hot side, your on the right track turning these two valves more open"
"You can try some glue, but it probably won't work. The part that is hanging down is just the symptom of a bigger area that has lost adhesion. It's not a difficult fix, though. Just start scraping the texture off until you reach a point that doesn't come off easily. Once you have the bad part removed, dab some sheetrock mud onto the ceiling with a sponge, leaving little peaks hanging down. Then take a wide blade and ""knock it down."" You will have a little time to play with it if you need some do-overs before it dries. "
"redid a master bath last year and came to the conclusion that tubs, while nice really don't pull their weight compared to the space savings and use of a shower. We nixed the tub and don't miss it.  On buying a house that does not have one, its a traditional part of the home, people expect it if they have the need (young children, elders) but it really comes down to the people's choices, and you really have no accounting for taste in buyers, there are so many things they weigh, some that make sense and some that don't."

"I guess my info came from various forum posts I've read over the years that discussed this very topic. Basically, they generally said that the purpose of heat pads/adhesives/pastes was just to fill in the gaps between two pieces of metal with something that conducts heat ""better than air,"" which is pretty much anything, and regular epoxy was listed as having decent (though slightly worse than ""specialized"" substances) enough heat conductive properties that were much better than air and only slightly worse than aforementioned specialized substances. They also mentioned ""liquid metal"" as being the only substance one could put between the two pieces of metal to get very good conduction, but obviously that has none of the physical adhesive/retention properties I also want."
"When the deck is level with the back door and has a railing, it's very kid-friendly. You can use it as an extension of the house with toddlers. Just put a child gate on the stairs down to the ground. No railing is obviously difficult with little kids. Steps down from the door to the deck are not as big a deal, but also an added worry with really little ones. Also, if you are going to have a grill on the deck, having it level with the kitchen is handy. It doesn't have to be the whole deck, just a grill area beside the stairs down to the main deck. That's how our deck is set up and it works well (french doors from kitchen to a small deck that's basically just a landing with a set of wide stairs running down to the main deck, and a small 6x6 grilling area to one side."
"You need to measure the spring wire diameter and count the coils, and also measure the inside and outside diameter of the coil. Springs are normally sold for specific garage door weights in two pound increments.

"Ohio Masonry contractor, The advice you are getting is the right way to go! When dealing with water start with what you know is broken before you get into the big fixes! Grading, water should run away from the house! With patios and driveways they tend to settle more at the house and drain water against it( replacement is best but you can caulk it with urethane for a temp. fix! Gutters and downspouts and the drains attached to them! If you have trees you have these issues, you have to clean them regularly! Often times when the drains are installed the pipe isn't glued! One thing I see often is that the elbow next to the house will get blown off of the pipe causing a leak, pull the downspout and look with a flashlight for clogs or disconnected pipe! Sometimes basements will continue to leak and you may want to waterproof it, I only recommend exterior waterproofing, think of it like this, if the roof leaked you wouldn't hang a tarp in the attic to divert the water into a drain. Water over time will damage your foundation!"
"Some others are on the right track. Hereü__s exactly what I would do. Remove those slats that were holding up the mud bed to fully expose the joists below. Sister each joist including the ones under the wall with a joist as big as what is there now. Since these are old, they are probably true 2x8s or something which would actually be 2ü_ù x 8ü_ù. In that case use a modern 2x8. Attach each one with two screws 1 1/2ü_ù from each edge of the joist every 16ü_ù along the joist. Use 3ü_ù SPAX screws. Or if you can get in there okay, you can use 16d framing nails, same nailing pattern. As you attach these, it is most important that they are level with each other, not with the existing joists. This is the time to correct the floor and make it flat and level. Then at the ends of the room, install blocking perpendicular to those joists in each bay. You can screw these in. Predrill on an angle before you put them in place to make it easier. When you nail in your 3/4ü_ù subfloor plywood, nail only into the new joists and blocking. "
"I'm just saying that there are a lot more things that can go wrong when you have a a compression clip or teeth holding in the wire versus a proper twisting that holds on its own and if I'm putting my name on a job, I'd rather trust my own abilities to twist a wire properly than a few spring loaded clips, teeth, or plastic lever that may or may not hold.  In my experience, I have seen a lot more of those pop out than I've seen wire-nuts fail.  The only times I see wire-nut issues is when someone didn't twist the wires right.  Normally on a 20 amp circuit, nothing is supposed to melt off so I wouldn't want that either way but I was just mentioning that to show that a mechanical connection would hold until the whole house is pretty much gone even.  For the sake of argument, there are applications that you want the connection to hold till the last possible minute before it self destructs - for instance fire pumps where even the overload protection is designed to let them run as long as possible. Anyway, you don't have to take my word for it. I know Europeans think that Americans are backwards for using something so primitive but if something works great for both solid and stranded wires, is very cheap and available, I don't see any reason not to use it.  &amp;#x200B;"
"I've done this, but only because my basement was a permitted area of work and I wasn't allowed to sheath them until I had my in wall inspections, for insulation, plumbing, and electrical.  I had exposed XPS insulation in my basement for about a year as all the work was done.  My plumbers didn't use fire shields while sweating pipe (Chicago area so we are required to use copper) and burned/melted some spots of insulation.  There was no issue with ignition.  DOW puts a good amount of fire retardants in their Foamular product.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPoY6nsh1Vs  I can't find videos of it self igniting after a certain point.  I've seen other UL style tests of it in building assemblies where it burned, but didn't self ignite.  If you are wanting to do a proper job, make sure you tape and air seal all the joints in the foam (DOW makes an awesome tape for this).  You don't want warm moist air hitting cold sections of your foundation.  A ramset gun (powder actuated fasteners) with insulation washers makes quick work of installing the sheets.  Good on your for recognizing the code and wanting to accommodate it.  Another alternative would be to use foil faced polyisocyanurate insulation as the foil face takes care of the code required ignition requirements.  "
"Ok let me first say that the majority of these responses are anecdotal and I have concerns about the advice given. I'm an Industrial Hygienist, here are the facts: For asbestos to be hazardous to human health, it has to be friable, and you need to be exposed to an airborne concentration in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average (TWA) or in excess of 1.0 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (1 f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of thirty (30) minutes. I don't expect you to be able to figure out your level of exposure as you need instrumentation for that, but you should consider having an environmental consultant come into your home and conduct the assessment. Depending on the results of your assessment that should be able to provide the answers you are looking for: Should you move, are you at risk, whats you level of exposure, etc. In the meantime do not handle the tiles, and be cautious of the dust (personally I would cordon off the room that the tiles are in just to keep family out and to be on the safe side). A professional remediation company should come in to do any abatement if it is determined that it is in fact necessary (not joe-schmo, go with an environmental company). Also in the meantime you can get an air purifier with a HEPA filter which will help keep your air clean (though it will not solve the problem). Hope this helps. Edit: Actually re-reading the other responses I have to say you have been getting some incredibly dangerous and ignorant advice.   "
"Thereü__s a lot going on. PO parceled off and sold a piece of the property to his relative. Relative sold it off to neighbor lady, you bough original property from PO. Now you got your land surveyed by a land surveyor, I imagined licensed by your states land surveyors association, this surveyor would be using the survey information determined by the original parcels, and would be essentially word of god as far as anyone else is concerned regarding the boundaries. You should receive a certified document that identifies the dimensions and locations of the boundaries. The neighbor removed some of the stakes; this is where it gets annoying. If you can still tell where they were, thatü__s okay for your knowledge benefit, but you need to determine what you want to do. Are you fencing the boundary? Landscaping it accordingly? Etc? Depending if you just wanted to alleviate curiosity, fine no big deal, doesnü__t really matter. If you are wanting to grade and landscape your property according to the stakes, then itü__s something that needs to be replaced, and your neighbor willingly removed these, thus the cost to replace is solely on her to do so. Ultimately, the majority of these instances falls down to the courts. She is going to dispute you, and likely cause damage from here on out. You need a judge to determine the validity of the survey, and that will be taken as whatü__s what. Then you need to have the judge make judgement on the outcome of the damaged stakes which you may or may not have intended to use for construction purposes. If she disagrees, she needs to come up with her real property report for her land, and compare against yours, and then compare both to the survey. If she doesnü__t have this, thereü__s nothing she can really do or say, to dispute it. "
"I know you wanted solutions, and I can't really give you one, but I can share my recent experience with red oak flooring.We recently had ours refinished as it was under carpet for who knows how long. The flooring was in good condition to begin with so we were lucky. The stain/poly however was very yellowish and we didn't like it at all, so we had it all refinished (including stairs to both levels in our bi-level).My first bit of advice is to do the floors last after everything else because they WILL get damaged/scratched.Anyway...we went with no stain, just natural color, a sealant + 3 coats of Bona Mega HD water-based poly in satin (semi-gloss and higher show dirt/scratches much more easily). Bona makes good products, and perhaps the Mega HD wasn't the best choice, I don't know. I made the mistake of only asking what brand of poly they were using, not what the actual type it was under the brand.We didn't walk on the floor/stairs for like 3 days after they were finished, which was plenty of time to let it all cure. However, there were scratches immediately after walking on it in socks. That being said, the scratches are micro and were probably within the poly layers, so the wood isn't actually scratching.If you're going to replace/refinish hardwood stairs, get tread covers. Poly is going to scratch no matter what. We don't even have pets. I think I wore sneakers a few times going up and down and that's most likely what scratched the poly. My son even ran a car toy or two across the floor and there are marks in the poly layers. That said, they are hard to see. I'm just a freak and examine everything closely since we just moved in.I guess tldr; Your dogs will most likely damage the flooring very quickly and you'll need to refinish it often. Keeping their nails at bay may minimize it.[Stairs 01](https://imgur.com/3Pnn156)-edit- Actually...thinking about this...part of me wants to believe the company we hired didn't actually do 3 coats.

"Holy shit that's sketchy as all hell.  Of note: I'm not an engineer,  butttttt lets do some math. Im going to likely be wrong.&amp;#x200B;Googled some averages here: 4 door sedan is 3900 lbs and 15 feet long. 70inches wide (5.8 feet)Now I don't believe you can just design your floor for  weight of the car because the contact points of the car's weight is transferred on is so tiny. Your car tires contact patch is dependent on the tire size but an average 225mm width tire,  is roughly 37 square inches per tire of contact with the ground at any given time (googled this).So your subfloor ( plywood)s needs to withstand the deflection of the weight of the cars tires contact surface area multiplied by the weight of the car per tire/. This load will be affected by the spacing between joists as i assume the compression of plywood over a joist would transfer the load adaquately enough without crushing the plywood too much.You need the joists need to withstand the weight of the car over the area its loaded on but its not that easy because the car is carrying its weight on the tires, located in corners of its surface area (birds eye view) several feet apart. The effect this has on the beam is weird and completely foreign to me because essentially there is a cantilever effect of sorts (that's probably the wrong term) as the weight is closer to the supporting foundation when parked.  Further, it is certainly not evenly distributed over the beam. or even parked in the middle of the beam. so you have to calculate beams for having huge loads on them in only certain areas.The strength that plywood has to support is dependent on the joists spacing due to the moment arm length. but you have to accomodate 1000lbs per tire / 37 square inches = 27 lbs per inch now that tires contact point in . which is fucking heavy.&amp;#x200B;I wouldn't trust that redneck engineering you have and certianly not with my child's life when shes in the back seat. get an engineer man.BTW if you want to build this properly you're looking at lvl beams and reusing those steel posts, you have have to pour new footings depending on if there is any.My ""fuck it"" answer : ensure your foundation is grouted a couple layers where the lvl beams will rest gunna have to notch this out without fucking up the walls/sill plate...then lvl beams probably double 9 3/4 x 1 3/4 x your span length. 1 foot apart under where the tires are likely to drive, then double up 2x10 on the joists to the left and right of them nails 3 high every 6-12inches , then single 2x10 for the regular floor . put a railroad tie or double laminated lvl beam perpendicular and underneath each set of lvl beams and jack post every 1/3 of the span ensuring there is a 2ftx2ftx 8 inch concrete footing run plywood 1/2 perpendicular to the beams then another layer of 1/2 parallel to the beam. fuck steel plate for the tire tracks wouldn't hurt either. dont wanna do LVL beams, triple 2x12 or 2x10 laminated with 3 inch nails either side 3 nails tall 12in apart.Cheapo answer, double or triple 2x10 under the tire tracks, then 2x10 12"" oc again notched into the foundation after ensuring it's grouted. posts every 1/3 of span with footings underneath. sheath it the same. Pour yourself a drink, ensure your neighbours are not anywhere close and hope it stays up."

I did this.  My house had horse hair plaster.  We re did the walls with drywall so that we could run new wiring in the house and put in insulation.   We had knob and tube wiring which isnü__t good.  If you are upgrading your insulation or wiring itü__s a good idea.

I mean yea you could do that. Those should be long enough. Why are you anchoring a table though? Especially one that heavy. Not sure if your aware but you have to use a hammer drill to pre drill hole for those screws. The carpet may get all tangled up in your bit too.
"I think it's clear that it was originally a wall sheathed with horizontal boards, covered in wallpaper. At some point, someone decided they'd rather have a plaster wall, so the plasterers nailed their lath directly over the existing wall. No more mysterious than that."

"If your trade off is a macerating toilet vs an ejector pit, IMO itü__s half a dozen of one, six of the other. Both are not pleasant to fix issues with. But if your alternative is below grade out of the house without a pump, absolutely go that route if at all feasible."
In addition to this....If you call your landlord you should also immediately send a follow-up email. That way if they choose to not have it fixed immediately and it causes a lot of damage they cant place blame on you for not contacting them. Always have a paper trail!
"Is it though? It would add two more bedrooms and one more bath to our home. I can do the finish work myself. I feel it could turn my house into a $90k-$100k home.Besides, if we were to move instead, $30k is better than the cost of moving and restarting our mortgage."
"It could be because of poor priming or painting. It also could be something more acute, like a leak. You shoudl investigate further for signs of water infiltration. But even in the best case I donü__t see how you fix that problem without repainting at least that wall."
It's kind of the same here in GA. The homeowner can get their own permits and do the work themselves if they want or get the permits and then hire someone income do the work. Passing inspection is key and there is plenty of GA code literature readily available online.

Lightning is so crazy sneaky with the amount of damage it does! You need to take everyoneü__s advice on calling professionals. Our house was struck and it took us WEEKS to fully realize the extent of damage. If you donü__t use things regularly itü__s so hard to tell. 
Make sure you frame walls with the correct thickness. You need more space for plumbing drains.  This is one of the many things the prior owner screwed up... and I didnü__t know until the day of closing because they hid the drain popping out of the wall with a dresser.
"No. Screw him. Iü__ve been in the remodeling business forever and there have always been guys who are ü__too busyü_ù to return calls. They suck and they give the rest of us bad names. He didnü__t have the time or courtesy to call you, so why are you worried about him?"
"Not necessarily. There could be  waterproofing on the outside of the foundation, which would mostly protect the walls. Dirt is a lot more porous, and it can also give off radon gas. It's worth trying to cover all the dirt even if you don't do anything about the walls."
"Oh that :D well i'm from Croatia, we had some wars going on 28 years ago, we got a plane drop two bombs on my house, one fell in the storage area one in the living room, luckily none of those went off on the impact, we were lucky to have just two holes in the roof :) "

Thatü__s soooo helpful thanks! Iü__ve saved this comment for future reference :-) itü__s about to be the rainy season here so we probably wonü__t get to this until next year. But I would be interested in seeing your leveling tool if you get a chance to share the pic! 
The amounts youü__re dealing with are unlikely to produce enough fumes to be harmful. I would simply wait for the first to evaporate to avoid the slight risk and the smell. Safety wise youü__re fine to go immediately after assuming itü__s a moderately ventilated area.
"The outlets are GFCI protected, which makes them safe to use around water. There is a rule about tubs but not faucets or other water sources. And this is just a pipe, not even anywhere water will be coming out of. I woudnü__t worry abou it (other than the aesthetics)."
"There are specific types of sealant to use with EIFS, which you want to make sure you use when you reseal the hole. Don't just grab any tube from the big box store. I don't remember which ones are recommended, but a little online searching should turn up some results."
"They are replaceable, but I've not been able to find them in big box stores before - you can definitely order them from mcmaster, but you've got to buy like 50 of them.  Easiest thing would be to buy the cheapest/shortest hose you can find and rob the washers from it."
They work like a Chinese finger trap and the spring tension is pretty stiff since it is preventing the wire from pulling out and causing a fire. Even if you pigtail smaller wire you will need to insert it into the terminal and should not be able to easily pull it out.
This could be it here. The pipes that I see vibrating are copper but it's very possible they are connected to steel somewhere down the line. Or they may be copper all the way to a problematic valve somewhere. I'll investigate and report back my findings for posterity.
"What about wrapping it around the outlet to cover the screws/exposed part of the wires, especially when the box is metal?  [http://www.hammerzone.com/archives/elect/repairs/outlet/elrcxc31a.jpg](http://www.hammerzone.com/archives/elect/repairs/outlet/elrcxc31a.jpg)"

"&gt;It's a huge red flag that a customer will try to renegotiate the pricing after the work if they don't want to pay a deposit.That's a fair point. I suppose it all depends on the research done and overall credibility of a person's company. I would be more accepting of a contractor wanting a down payment if they have visible credible work. I had a couple friends that long ago paid 50% down on a large renovation and the contractor skipped town. Probably doesn't happen like that anymore, but always makes me cautious. "
"Air into the house must equal air out of the house. If you've found a way to break the laws of physics you better be submitting for a nobel prize.That freezing cold air MUST come into the house somewhere, better to have it only be in the 1 bathroom than moving thruout the whole house, driving up your heating costs.If you don't like the cold air just wait until leaving the room to turn on the exhaust fan.

"Go to a plumbing showroom. Everything at big box stores is crap. Even ""good"" manufacturers make specific models for the big box stores, replacing the brass components with cheap plastic.Seriously. Go to a plumbing store. You'll be amazed at the quality and selection.We got a Brizo with a pull-out sprayer and we love it.Tip: Nobody pays retail at these places. You can expect ~30% off the retail price (ask for the ""contractor price""). Generally, final prices are comparable to efaucets.com or other similar websites."
"Good comparison [here](https://www.pexuniverse.com/types-of-pex-tubing).  PEX-B is cheaper and more popular; Iü__m usually in a minority with my preference for A.  Why do I prefer A?  PEX-A has the highest cross linking and fittings are performed by tubing expansion not crimps; over time PEX-A fittings grow tighter while B fittings grow looser.  PEX-A and ProPEX fittings are stronger and wider diameter and less restrictive whereas every PEX-B fitting is a considerably smaller inside diameter than the tubing itself.  "
"I'm not really sure what you're asking at this point. If they're coming back to fix it and your dryer is smart enough to not run until it is, there's not much left to do but just wait until it's fixed.Unless you're wondering if you should override the dryer and run it anyway?No, you shouldn't.Best case, the dryer can't vent air, your clothes won't dry, and you waste a shitload of energy for nothing. Worst case, you create a lint dam in the vent and burn your house down.Have them fix it and move on. Good luck."
"If you are looking to completely repaint, head to a Benjamin Moore retailer and ask for cabinet coat. They will likely recommend a primer specifically designed for cabinets, which you apply first. Then you can apply coats of cabinet coat as needed, usually 2-3 coats depending on the tint of the paint. I also recommend using a silver tip Wooster brush, as they donü__t leave as many streaks as normal brushes. In addition, they sell these little yellow roller heads that are great for rolling the doors and cabs themselves."

"Looks like that's meant for new-work.  They make some that can be [installed as old-work fans](https://www.homedepot.com/p/NuTone-EZ-Fit-80-CFM-Ceiling-Bathroom-Exhaust-Fan-ENERGY-STAR-EZ80N/205130123). Another option is to do something [similar to this](https://www.handymanhowto.com/panasonic-whisperceiling-vent-fan-old-work-installation-steps/) where you build your own frame around the fan to screw into.  Just curious, what's the model for your fan?

"Since you already have answers on the hole, I'll just make a trap suggestion. [These work great](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005V6BQMY/), easy to set, and are quick and humane compared to glue traps. I have kids and pets so I don't do poison just in case, but these with a little dab of peanut butter in the cup has been working great for control over the last couple of years.

"There are websites that sell all the components to do it yourself, the cost is a few hundred per 500 square feet and about 750 for the commerical size dehumidifier.   So you have to ask yourself if 8k for labor is worth it when it would take a crew 1 day, maybe 2 to do it.  Encapsulation is the hot button term right now so everyone is capitalizing on it when it's cheap and doesn't take any special skill to do.  I was going to pay someone to do it, but not when they are charging 10x the cost of materials for an install."
"When this has happened to me in the past, it wasn't the base or wax ring at all. It was loose tank bolts, allowing water to slowly, but steadily, seep out and run down the back of the toilet, and collect on the floor.The reason wax is used is because it takes very little precision when setting to toilet to deform the wax and make a tight seal. Plus, water isn't just constantly sitting against it, anyway. It's probably not leaking. But I'm sure it's happened before.If the tank cracked, it was likely already leaking."
"Wow... I have one that looks scary familiar to this. My father (has 20+ years of experience with custom tile) built a ü__customü_ù shower for me in my first house.

"You are correct. I think that /u/chrisbrl88 is referring to that fact that some insulative materials can become waterlogged if entombed behind heavyweight plastic.  This sometimes happens in basements that have fiberglass batts against the foundation wall, and then a vapor barrier atop that.But he would have to verify that I am understanding his post.The best way to stick your barrier to the walls is to use acoustic sealant.  It is not cheap unless you buy a case of it, but it has a grip that will last for decades."
"Are there any furniture items, throw rugs, or other items that were in the basement before the water problems were fixed?  Smells can stick to any porous items.  If you have things like plastic tubs that were there, you may want to try just wiping them down with a spray cleaner.  If you have uphostered furniture, i'd get close and take a big whiff and see if it's coming from there.  I recently inherited some wooden furniture from my grandmother, who kept a very neat home but also abused Estee lauder perfume, and when we wiped it down with wood cleaner, the paper towels came away black, despite the fact that the wood looked and felt clean when touching with dry hands.  It still smells a bit, and I've wiped it down again, but at least this time the towels came away clean."
"Is this a custom home or a tract home with custom options? (It sounds like the latter). Whether itü__s fair or not probably isnü__t the right question; theyü__re going to charge more for whatever is popular right now because they can. You could request primed trim/doors and get quotes for painting everything yourself. They are lying if they say they canü__t get it....but they may charge a premium for it because itü__s not in their pre-negotiated package. I would also be super wary of any kitchen that comes with a tract home and consider installing something youü__ve designed yourself. There are so many fantastic options of drawers and organizers that will make it more functional for you. With the amount of use a kitchen gets it would be worth some additional expense. "
"Plaster and Lathe.I have these walls.My house was built sometime around 1920.There is no insulation on the exterior walls. There is a thin weather resistant insulation on the exterior under the siding.The siding is also hung on long 1"" boards, not osb or plywood so there are little gaps everywhere on the exterior.I had to redo my bathroom to move in. I pulled the plaster, and left the lathe up, and drywalled over it. I put insulation in while doing that room, and plan to do the same in the rest of the house.I also need to insulate under my floorboards in the basement.I have blown in insulation in the attic.If you want to play with plaster you can replaster,  its expensive, and if you want colored walls, you can dye your plaster for a nice permanent color."
"Assuming you don't have radon issues to address, I would close the vents in the summer if you have AC.  With AC, the interior air will be cool and dry so there shouldn't be elevated levels of humidity in the crawlspace.  However, if you close the vents in the winter, that may be a bad idea.  If you're not using AC or a dehumidifier the air from your conditioned space which is warm and full of moisture will travel from high energy to low energy, meaning it will move from your conditioned space down to your crawlspace since your crawlspace will be cooler.  All that moisture would have an escape path to the outside via the vents but if you close them off the moisture will condense on your foundation walls and you'll have mold.  To counteract that you'll need to have a dehumidifier in the crawlspace.  If you study conditioned crawlspaces and crawlspace encapsulation you'll see that you need a system in place to properly seal your crawlspace comprised of vapor barriers, mechanical ventilation, dehumidifiers and insulation.

"&gt;The electrical wire coming into the box is grounded to a ground screw on a piece of metal in the back. The receptacle isn't sitting in a metal or plastic box, just has a metal strip in the back that the ground is connected to.Do you have a picture of what you're referring to exactly?  What do you mean the receptacle isn't in a metal or plastic box, what is the ""metal strip"" in the back of exactly?

Check hot wire to ground **carefully** with power on and verify you have 120v.  Turn power off and check continuity between neutral wire and ground wire.  If both of those are true, you can pigtail a ground wire off that existing ground wire.I'm not entirely sure what you're stating in your first paragraph, so make sure all splices and receptacles are installed in outlet boxes (plastic or metal).  If metal, the box itself must also be grounded by screwing in a copper wire into the back of the box.  All ground wires on the same circuit should be spliced together within the box.  "
"This is purely anecdotal and lots of others said similar things, but sometimes it helps to hear things from multiple people so here's my little bit of info.Hubs and I bought 2 years ago, house built in the 30s. Been through multiple owners, multiple updates, some done well and some fly by night diy jobs. Lots of stuff that is kind of a pain, garage is stuffed onto a tiny space, couple of settling doors, bowed floor, chimney needed tuckpointing, strange plumbing choices, some basement leaks, ANCIENT cellulose insulation, on and on. That said, the house is beautiful and while it's taken some $$ to fix things when they come up, it's all been doable. The house has stood for 90 years, it's unlikely to collapse anytime soon and fixing the previous fuck ups, well that kinda blows but at least then we know it's done right.Your place has stood for 60, it's unlikely to fall down now. Just make a list and start knocking off things that bother you one at a time. It may take some investment and some experts, estimates, tear ups, etc. But you'll know it's done correctly and you'll love it that much more. And you might find out that some stuff that you find alarming may actually be totally normal. Just don't panic and find out what the next step on the list is, and it'll be great."
"You shop vac is not HEPA, you would know it if it were because you'd have to wash the filter every 10-15 minutes of use and it would have cost 50% more. If you buy a HEPA filter, consider buying 2 because you have to wash and completely dry them constantly.Normal vacuuming spreads the dust everywhere. So does sweeping. Pros will typically seal a work area off with plastic, that's the law in many places. I think in my state that is the law and home owners aren't allowed to do it at all unless it's a tiny spot.A wet mop is good for picking up the dust that just landed on hard surfaces, not what is still in the air and hasn't landed or landed on something else. The dust will be on furniture, under it, on curtains, in fabrics, rugs, carpets, on your kid's coat and clothes, etc. You might get the visible stuff but kids and pets are notorious for getting into places you didn't think of. If it's just a small spot then it *might* not be a big deal and I'm over reacting, but I'd be super paranoid around a little kid.

"Do get more quotes.  It is just like buying a car.  You can buy a Yugo, or you can buy a Cadillac.   The prices for the different brands of openers vary wildly.If this is going to be your forever home, I'd like to caution you on going with a budget opener.  They weigh less, and use more plastic.  Which translates to more breakdowns and a shorter lifespan.  If you can afford it, go with a commercial unit, designed for apartments and gated communities.  They can give you more than 20 -30 years of trouble free operation."
"For all the people talking about tearing out plaster walls, if you're in North America it's a really good idea to have a small sample of the wall tested for asbestos before proceeding. Asbestos was commonly added to plaster from about the 1940's to the 1990's. Often only in scratch coat on top, but there could be more. As long as the walls are in good condition, they can sit there for decades and won't be any health risk, but once you start tearing them down, that's when asbestos fibres could get released into the air.

"Go get a copy of the landlord tenant act for your locality.  It's a guide laying out landlord responsibilities and legal requirements.Example:  Back in the day when I was renting, I had a problem with the furnace that the landlord didn't fix.

"I am not sure if you are simply using the wrong term, but I would never do serious drywall with spackle.  Spackle is for minor repairs, like nail holes, not for taping joints.  If you are in fact using the wrong product, get yourself some proper drywall compound and you are going to be amazed at how much easier it is.  As for the picture... that is a real mess.  I would cut the tape out, properly embed new tape and skim the whole area.  You have to tape the transition wherever youü__ve installed new pieces of drywall."
"I had a friend in high school whose house was hit by lightning. Her father was bent over putting something away under their bar or working on something on the bottom of their bar.

I lived for several years on the third floor of a 3-story multi family home with a tankless water heater in the basement and low GPM. It would take several minutes (5+ no exaggeration) to get hot water up to our bathroom or sink if we hadnü__t run hot water for a few hours. It was the freaking worst and such a waste of water. We recently bought a house with a tank water heater and it feels like sorcery to get hot water mere seconds after turning the faucet on. Iü__m not sure I could be convinced to ever go tankless now.
"I used them in my bathroom refresh. Our town inspectors are sticklers (fined the previous homeowner thousands for an improperly permitted deck and made him demo it and rebuild) so I put an access panel on the other side of where I was installing them.  Inspector sees the shark bites and makes a comment on how expensive they are. I joke that it was less expensive than a plumber and he laughs. I tell him about the access panel I put in on the other side and he just goes ""nah you didn't have to do that, they'll be fine""."
"I would never move my family into a house that wasn't as clean as possible. Before I moved into my current home with my then-eight-month-old daughter I set off a bunch of bug bombs, then paid about $1400 to have a forensic cleaning service come in before we moved in. The house was absolutely spotless from top to bottom, including the basement and garage and vents and bathrooms. Even if there wasn't anything really bad to clean up, the money spent to clean the house was well worth the time saved vs cleaning it up myself."
"If you don't have a sawzall, you can use a hacksaw to cut the nails.  Probe around with the hacksaw to find which side has the stud, then cut the nails.  There should be two nails, and they'll be on the same side.  You can get a one-ended hacksaw handle, or just hold a regular hacksaw blade in you hand (wear a workglove).  I've cut out several new-work boxes this way.  Once you find the nails, you should be able to cut through in about a minute.  They're not high-strength nails - they only needed to hold a device box."
"Itü__s reasonable to ask for reasonable updates, but it may be helpful to define your frequency and format so you can ask your PM for something specific.  If you want a 10 minute weekly phone check-in on Friday afternoons, ask for that and I bet youü__ll get it.  If you want a full email summary at the end of each work day, your guy will need to budget a bunch of extra time for you and may just flake on it because itü__s an unreasonable ask.  He is running a job in addition to talking you through the process, after all."
"Well, what is on the drainage easement? Is it a buried pipe, a ditch, utilities? If you told us what there is to justify their easement we could give you a better answer. If itü__s just a drainage ditch, I donü__t see a problem. Before you decide to move forward, just be ready to accept the fact that there is a chance they can have you remove the screen and pavers. No one knows the chance, but if youü__re fine with that then you have your answer.IMO, five feet extension isnü__t that big of a deal on that easement."
"You're right in that 8 is more than I would need at any given time but the reason behind originally picking the 36"" was to have 6 full size burners as I constantly run out of room on the 30"" I have now. So going from 6 -&gt; 8 isn't that much of a change. This would also give me two full size ovens which would definitely be utilized.  Price wise for the ranges it's actually pretty close, only about $1000 difference (which seems like a lot, but when you are putting $1000 into the price of a new house, it's negligible.

"its only been installed on like a dozen homes very near to tesla as more of a test than anything.  the installation was apparently exponentially longer than they were led to believe, but was covered by Tesla within the original price (again, probably testing).The fact that they have not expanded suggests there is an issue with the economics of it right now.  Also, the homes they picked were very simple roofs, large flat surfaces.Long story short, look at conventional panels if you want ""solar"" rather than ""tesla""."
"&gt; Possibly add a dehumidifierIf you are going to use a power-hungry appliance to dry your clothes, why not just use an actual clothes dryer?&gt; I guess the door will need to be water resistant...A door that doesn't get damaged by moisture will still allow mold to grow on it. Same with the paint.&gt; The space is reasonably big - so there's a fair amount of air.Meaning the arched space you want to close off? I don't think that's enough air to absorb all the water from a load of clothes without further circulation. They will dry slowly and get musty. I think your best option will be curtains with plenty of space above and below to allow air movement while still looking nice. A fan angled to pull air in or push air out of the space would certainly help too. "
"Defective products are defective. That does not mean all similar products are defective. Overall copper piping has been subject to more defective product lawsuits than PEX has, so should we assume all copper is an issue? The copper piping manufacturers are unwilling to offer any type of warranty where as PEX manufacturers will back their product for 25 years.I deal with piping failures of all types on a regular basis. Copper failures aren't some foreign concept to me. There are numerous installations I've dealt with where any material other than copper would have been a better choice.I'd suggest rather than trying to dig up data to back your prematurely biased view you consider material choices are far more nuanced than simply claiming one is superior to the other."
"I think you are underestimating how much work it's going to be to correct this. Your ""drywall guy"" kind of screwed you here.You may or may not be able to get those new work boxes free with what little clearance you have (might need to use a metal cutting bit on an oscillating tool to cut the nails). Then you can't reuse them so you will need to get some old work boxes, hopefully the wires have enough slack so that you can fit them into place. Try to avoid making the holes any bigger or else there is no chance of ever getting the old work boxes attached properly.In the end you may have to just cut out large openings around those boxes to give you enough room to work (12""x16"" or so, try to end on a stud), but then there will be a bunch of drywall seams to mud and tape."
"I'd hazard a guess they purchased them loose. At best, it'll have the name of the manufacturer on the back of the tile, but even that is slim odds.I'd definitely check out JB's forum and see if anyone can match, or take it to a local tile supply store and see if they recognize the pattern at all - though it's pretty unlikely.Odds are it was donated out of a bunch of old supplies, and it's discontinued. If you're lucky, it's something timeless (a la subway tile or winckelmans) which will still be produced today. In all likelihood you can no longer get the exact tile you're trying to get more of, in which case you'd be better off 'randomizing' it in with other tile. Beware of tile sizes, a '600mm' box measurement can be anything between 594 to 600mm from my experience."

"Same thing happened to me. Water department told me I used 3x the water in a month and believed there was a leak off the meter. I didn't think I had a water shut off at all in the house side, only the meter. I checked crawl space, found where the main entered, went just outside to where the pipe penetrated the foundation and started digging. About 8 inch down I found a covered tube, opened it up and it was full of water. Took a cup and tried to drain it, found a really old PRV and shutoff. Found the leak. Ended up hiring a plumber to replace the full underground line with Pex, and put in a new shutoff and prv. Cost about 3k. It was the middle of summer when this happened to me, so as others said the ground was really saturated and I was able to narrow it down quickly. "

"BIN is a shellac-based primer/sealer, as opposed to water or oil based.  Because the shellac separates from the pigment much more readily than either water or oil do, BIN needs to be mixed much more frequently than other primers.  If it appears to have separated, which it will between refillings of whatever smaller container you were painting from, then you need to stir or shake to re-mix.I would advise purchasing in one gallon containers, for ease of shaking.  We have found this far outweighs the cost savings for the 5 gallon containers.  That, and clean-up after spilling a 5 gallon bucket of BIN is a nightmare.  Never want to repeat that.From the sound of it, what you have painted with BIN so far should be fine.  The shellac is what seals, so you applied more shellac (tannish) and less pigment (white). You may need to apply more than 2 top coats of paint, due to the lack of pigment in the primer, but the sealer component should be more than adequate. Good luck.-GC, New Orleans, specializing in historic restoration"

Vermiculite from other mines has much less to no asbestos, but regardless you should always treat it as asbestos containing material.If you blow in new insulation with existing vermiculite, you run the risk of disturbing it and exposing yourself to asbestos. Personally I just had all the vermiculite removed from my attic and it was done in a day. Cost was over $4000 however, and unfortunately tested negative for Libby so wasn't covered by the trust. Still glad I got rid of it though, and now I can blow in R60 worth of cellulose, as well as update the attic routed electrical and air seal everything."
"Your inspector may be liable, depending on what his inspection states &amp; the length of time that has passed since inspection.  I would contact your realtor first, they may have seen this in the past.  Even if they hadn't, their network is large, from coworkers, lawyers, quality inspectors to structural engineers, etc..  Also, that realtor will want to sell your house again, so this is a great 1st/ inexpensive step.I had a foundation problem many years after buying.  I contacted my insurance, USAA.  They sent out their engineers after their initial inspector denied my claim.  I asked why I was denied, I got a bogus answer and then I  asked about this guys qualications and certifications.  A month later I received a 58pg report.  Bottom line, I was told the settling occurred due to soil expansion &amp; contraction over the many many seasons.  My claim was denied again.  USAA categorized the issue as ground movement/earthquake.  No sh1+.  Not covered under normal policy. Cost me about 10k to get it fixed.   Best of luck-"
"Not going to lie, I'm a master electrician and it took me damn near 10 minutes of staring at the switch diagram to figure it out and it seems like you're right.You are correct about the top button. It is a double throw switch with the middle position being neutral and left and right.  The line input is the black wire on the switch and the two outputs are either black or red depending on the side.  They can not be more than 5 amps each which is plenty for lighting but not enough for heating.You are also correct about the bottom and middle switches which are more traditional and have a common screw line and two load outputs on the screws one of which can be for the fan and the other for the heat.The fan part is easy enough - just follow the diagram for the junction box and keep track of your wires.&amp;#x200B;**A few words of caution** \- having two 12/3's and a 12/2 goes over the volume of your old work single gang box. With the device it comes out to be 24.8 cubic inches and it looks like you're doing the harder way and running 3 12/2's and one 12/3  so you're up to 27 in^(3) which will never fit in an old work single gang box since even the deepest ones are only 22 in^(3) so you need a 2 gang box.  And if you're going to put in a 2 gang box, why mess with that ridiculous switch in the first place? Just get two Doogles and make your life easier.  Or hell, get a 3 gang box and put the heater and the fan on its own countdown timer so you don't accidentally leave it on over a weekend and risk a fire.And of course it goes without saying that all your grounds should be together and neutrals should be tied together and this should be on a dedicated circuit given how much power it uses....and strip all the wires nice and neat, etc. and don't sue if something goes wrong."

"The bathroom is certainly an eye catcher, looks much better than the original!Also, did you have any photos of the waterproofing stage? I'm in the industry, so always looking out for the preparation work and was sad to see it progressed right to the finish. Cheers! "
"&gt;Put the scrap directly into bags or trash cans and haul it outside, skipping the part where it gets dumped onto the floor in a huge mess.Seems obvious, but this saves a ton of work.  Moving debris twice instead of just once really drags out the demolition process."
"3M makes these which will stick really well. 3M Safety-Walk Tub and Shower Tread, Clear, 2-Inch by 180-Inch Roll, 7641NA. You really want something which will attach to the tub directly. Any movement at all from a teak mat or those suction rubber mats can cause a fall. "
"As a heating contractor I'd suggest a small amount of spray foam just to fill the gap on the floor. Ideally you want as much space as possible,  so I'd spray foam it then use a dull blade to scrape most of the foam back away if you're unable to correct it any other way."
"Be careful adding cans to cathedral ceilings.  If you live in a northern zone, and arenü__t cautious with ensuring there is insulation between the can and the roof there is potential to have a warm zone on the roof.  This can cause an ice dam effect and create a leak.  "
Completely killed the smell.I donü__t think you need to take it all down.  Just saying what I think is going on.  Take the plates off all your receptacles and caulk the gaps around the boxes and any gaps you find elsewhere and I think you will notice a big difference.  
"Even if you find the same wallpaper, the colors won't match due to natural fading.A couple of questions:1. Has that stain dried? (Can't tell if it's oil or just water.)2. Would you consider wainscoting? It could look outstanding if done properly. Best to you OP."
"FYI, some of the lifetime warranties aren't transferable, so if you aren't the original purchaser, you may not be covered. Sometimes they'll make a one time exception. I just had this pop up with a leaky Moen - they sent a new cartridge, but it was a one time exception."
"For animal and especially urine, if you know the source, I love a product called Anti Icky Poo on Amazon. Itü__s a enzyme spray that eats through the urine crystals (also does does vomit, fecal, etc). It has been the only product to completely rid my house of the smell."
"Honestly, it just never even occurs to me that renting is an option half the time haha And there's no such thing as a ridiculous number of tools. I have 14 different kinds of saws, and I'm still not covered for many jobs. I really need a scroll saw for intricate work."
"I agree with everything but the plug. What is it that you think that will do that the gussets won't on their own. The member is compromised, no filler will change that, wood or air or otherwise. The only option is to add sister members to make up for the discontinuity. "
"I am very confused by your layout description but here are the basic rules:- any wall section that is at least 2ü__ wide needs at least 1 receptacle. So your 26ü_ù wall needs one.- no point along a wall can be more than 6ü__ from a receptacle (measured horizontally)."
"I did the same thing. Previous owners left it. I had planned to use it, but realized there was no power running to it, and I didn't want to hire an electrician to come set it up. I wound up calling up one of my buddies, and we made an afternoon of chopping the thing up."
"I eat most of my meals on the deck, as long as it's sunny - and it's sunny most of the time here. I go in and out of the house a few times for a meal, getting things or whatever. If yours is just for weekend brewskis or occasional entertaining, that's a big difference. "
"I had an customer give me homemade smoked salmon for lunch one day and homemade venison jerky and pepperettes every once in a while when I was on break. It was fantastic. As long as you donü__t get offended or the food goes to waste if itü__s not liked, I say go for it."
"I have both. The wall switch controls an outlet below that the push button is plugged into.  Itü__s not too late. I wouldnü__t say I couldnü__t leave without but itü__s def convenient when your hands are wet and you donü__t want to drip on the counter/backsplash/wall. "
"I know there are come commercial grade outdoor electric heaters, that I've seen on patios and such, but these are not traditional, ""decorative"" fans.  That Amazon link you keep posting, is not going to be nearly enough to generate any amount of heat in an outdoor space."

"I would look for some double-loop chain, cut one of the loops, and then form it so that that loop can wrap around one end of the shelf and pull against the top. I'd put something on the glass shelf if you are going right against the glass; perhaps some electrical tape. "
"I would put in a regular gas fired heater into those kick crawl spaces.   you can use a smart thermostat and don't need much more than a couple of vents.   You will sacrifice some storage space but this is IMO the better option.  how often does your are get below 0F? "
"If you literally have no cavity and no insulation you have two options: remove drywall, put up insulation and add drywall back. Downside(s): lots of work and the space inside is smaller. Or, insulate the exterior walls and re-apply siding on top of it. Neither is cheap."
"It looks like the water is being drained as soon as it gets in.Make sure that the drain pipe makes a loop that goes from wherever it is attached at the back of the washer, up above the water inlet pipe (or at least higher than the washer's tumble) , then to the drain. "
"It was regular faced insulation that we had from another project. Not sure of the R value. It was my mom's suggestion and our contractor thought it was dumb and didn't really want to fool with it, so my mom installed it for us one night and then contractor sheetrocked. "
"Just use the remote. Seriously. When I put fans in, I ran 14/3 to each fan box to have a dedicated switch for fan and light. I abandoned that since it had a remote and different controls built into the fan. You bought a fancy as fuck fan that came with a remote? Use it!"
Make sure the hinges and any moving parts are stainless steel and you shouldn't have any mechanical or movement issues. but no matter what your going to have a rust issue unless you paint it or put a clear coat on it. There isn't much you can do that close to the ocean.
"Man, that is a great house!Super jealous of the hot tub and I like the green lower cabinets. What is the feature at the foot of the stairs?? Looks like it would be a koi pond in a Chinese restaurant.Whereü__s your laundry? Near the master or on a different floor? "
"Multi meters are cheap, and can help you diagnose further problems. I've come across problems of a loose neutral which weren't detected by the outlet tester. Aka enough voltage got through to allow the lights on the tester to come on, but enough for regular appliances. "
"Not sure of any models with external thermostats but increasing Air circulation could help. Might seem counter intuitive to have a fan and heater going at the same time, but this would help normalize the temperature throughout the room, especially if its a larger space."
"Of course there have. Funded by who and over what time span? There used to be studies that lead in gasoline was totally safe!Anyway, to me personally, common sense says don't store your food / drinks in plastic for long times. Period.You're free to do what you want."
"One of these will get 98% of that off:https://www.homedepot.com/p/Personna-4-in-Floor-and-Wall-Stripper-Tool-with-5-Blades-61-0420-EACH/100174544There will still be dark spots, however.  I am not convinced that you can remove it all without staining and re-staining."
"Professional cleanings were completed, and anything found broken or in disrepair was fixed/upgraded, but we didnü__t change the carpet at the end of each annual lease. Nor did I change toilet seats for every tenant. I guess I never even thought that was an expectation. "
"Recently took out a fence. We rigged up a system where we attached a 2x4 to the side of the post with 4 screws and then used our bottle jack to push up on the 2x4. Very redneck rig, but it worked like a charm, and whoever put those posts in used a crap ton of concrete. "
"Retaining wall for house is called a foundation. Vent out the shortest route (less than 25 feet) with the least bends, going downhill from the dryer whenever possible. Use rigid metal ducting. Follow code.Is the dryer gas? If not, there is no carbon monoxide or gas."
"Take a hose with you and blow it down the downspout (disconnect the bottom connector to see if same amount of water is coming out). If all comes out as clear and no clog is found, then contact a contractor to install a new downspout towards the middle of the gutter run."
"Tenting for drywood termites, soil poisoning for terrestrial termites. Those are the best non gimmicky ways to halt a termite infestation.No idea how you killed birds or thought you did trying to control termites.Unfortunately, tenting is only guaranteed for a year."
Thanks a bunch. Weü__re about a 1/4 mile from the St. Johnü__s river in Jacksonville and Our neighborhood is a mosquito metropolis so I hope i have good luck with the bats. Do you mind if I asked the cost of that project and how long the aluminum pole was that you got? 
"Thanks for reply! I knew I shouldn't have doubted him ahah! So it's a big job to fit insulation?We just don't have the money available at the minute to even consider a replacement, but worth keeping in mind thanks. Off to the shop tomorrow to pickup an electric heater"
"Thanks for the help.Is white trim paint different from wall paint? Or is it still latex based / water soluble like wall paint is? I've used oil based paint once in the past and it was a bear to work with. Hoping I don't have the same ordeal to just touch up some trim."
"Thanks! Reusing them worked quite well. The thought came to me after I started to take them out, and then they sat around for quite a while, but finally got them all installed a few months ago.   Was either the laundry room or the garage! Made the right choice though. "
"That's weird since stoves are usually 240 volts and on a completely different circuit. Since it's just that outlet, the logical thing is to open it up and inspect all the wires (test voltages to neutral and ground, etc. ) and put in a new outlet if it all checks out. "
"Thatü__s a really good question.  The manufacturer doesnü__t specify different allowances for different directions, but in reality it may be more tolerant one direction.  Youü__re definitely making me feel better about this if we canü__t get the whole slope corrected!"
"This is interesting.  I already have a gas line run in the garage, I suspect you mean it would need to be extended upstairs in order to operate something like this.Would it be possible to control it by connecting a WiFi thermostat like a Nest or some other equivalent?"
"This is officially the anti-reddit-deck, deck.  At any point in the footing design did you think ""hm, this might be overkill""?  In 500 years someone is going to come across the remains of your home and there will be head scratching.All kidding aside, it looks GREAT!  "
"To clarify, I wasnü__t saying to use either method. I was saying to replace the device, and as cheap as they are, it wouldnü__t be a bad idea. I didnü__t recommend adding more wire because of potential space limitations inside the box that already has 2 circuits in it. "
"We recently had our master tub and shower redone and we put in a Koehler Air Tub with white onyx (subway tile design) and Koehler Bancroft trim, and 2 big caddies on opposite side as shower.We love it. We asked ourselves the same question but ended up keeping the tub "
"Were you painting over old paint? I had this issue in a few areas of my house where peeling the masking tape took several layers of paint with it, because whatever primer they used before apparently didn't adhere. I had no issue in the rooms that I primed myself though."
"Woodpeckers also peck to attract mates. They don't like shiney things so the hardware store sells some shiney ribbon tape (and other items) you can hang near the affected area, they will lose interest and move on.  It worked well for me, they never came back. Good luck."
"Yeah that is highly against code. The recommended approach is to put a GFCI outlet, and then run new wire. If you replace them with 3 progng with no ground, if there is any issue, and you touch something you become the ground. That is NOT good. It's not worth it. "
"Yeah, off the romex going from the switch to the first light fixture, just use a larger wire nut and run another section of romex from the light fixture to the next, connecting hot/hot - ground/ground - neutral/neutral. Rinse and repeat until you wire the last fixture. "
"Years ago, when I first started painting, I was told to learn the trade not the tricks. If I can learn to cut in, anyone can do it.Edit: I did not tape any of this. It is all done by marking my lines and free handing the lines. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/S5VUZV6.jpg)"
"You can get faux windows for the garage door, and hardware/like a handle and brackets. We bought ours at Home Depot and for $200 they totally changed the way our blah garage door looked. You cannot tell they arenü__t real unless you try to peep through the ü__glassü_ù. "
"You could be in danger. You're going to want a good respirator. Work should pay for it. OSHA requires them to provide adequate PPE (personal protective equipment. Also, get a copy of the MSDS (material safety data sheets) and read up on the potential hazards. Good luck."
"You're living there, he has a responsibility to ensure that it's safe. If nothing else, call the health department and anonymously report. Also, don't rule out any tenant laws.You need to rip out the carpet, and possibly even the subfloor. It depends on what you find."
"Yup. Paint the cabinets and walls white. Upgrade the hardware. Replace the ceiling lights with either pot lights or white track lights. Is the fridge pushed all the way in? It sticks out quite far, If you agent can stage the kitchen with a few pieces it might help. "
"chamberlain is a good brand to go withThey're not hard to install with 2 person but if you buy them from the big box store i think they charge $100-150  to do it for you. It's worth it. I did it myself and it took me more than half a day and cut myself in the process."
"probably wont get 2k back (the next buyer could pay the same 2k for a brand new window, or not, so why would they value a used window at the price of a new window?), you'll never know for sure, the motivating factor for this would be for your own benefit if you like it."
"the squareness is one issue, but you need to be sure the wall framing you put in is also plumb.  Remove all the cladding and sister/add framing to square up the corner but you will need to figure out how to make this work with the rest of the adjacent wall surfaces too."
"Another thought. The top of the fence should be the same height throughout. Take a tape measure and measure from the ground up and see what the height looks like at each section.  Where you have a slope, use a torpedo level and make sure you are measuring straight up. With that gate, they could keep the right leaf level and make a custom sloped panel with the left. They obviously werenü__t using Mexican prefab panels on this job. They got lazy or built the gate panels wrong and didnü__t see it until they were on site. "
"Dispersing the clippings over the yard is the best option, as the grass clippings are the best fertilizer there is for your grass. As others have said, if the grass is too long, you get clumps. But a good side discharge or good mulching deck with proper grass height looks great and is best for your lawn. Sometimes when the grass is wet, or too thick, Iü__ll either mow it twice, or hit with with a backpack blower to disperse clippings. What you donü__t want is clumps, because clumps smother the grass and can kill it. "
"I had a bathroom remodel done recently -- 2 week job and we went to Mexico for the second week.  The guys doing the work really appreciated not having to ""clean up"" every night.  They were done with the job before we got home from our trip.  Small company a guy runs out of his house.When we left, there was a 12-pack of beer in the fridge with one beer in it.  When we got home, that 12-pack had 11 beers in it.  They did some extras, too.  Fixed a stair railing, rebuilt a closet...  Nice job.  10/10 would rehire.  _˘Æ_˘Æ"
"I'm by no means an expert on this but I've done quite a bit of reading on drainage issues, as my house is plagued with these issues, too.  You need to reroute the water away from your house.  To do this, putting in gravel pit, perhaps with a french drain leading to a dry well, would likely be a solution.  I'm sure if you google image these terms (e.g., gravel drainage house), you'll see what I""m referring to, but [this is the basic idea](https://www.askthebuilder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/B14-2-Revised-560w.jpg)"
"In addition to the great advice you've already gotten, do you have renter's insurance? It will cover your property in case it's damaged by something like this. It's often very cheap, especially for a college student who is unlikely to have anything more expensive than a laptop. In fact, I've even had my insurance go down when signing up for it because the insurance company that handled my car insurance provided a discount for having a second type of insurance from them that was cheaper than the rental insurance payment. "
"No alarm, just wanted to clarify the situation. If something like what you describe happened in a ceiling, would pieces fall off? I plan to call the inspector we used to see if he has some suggestions now that we know more about the walls than a walk-through could tell us. [This article](https://www.oldhouseonline.com/articles/repairing-historic-flat-plaster-walls-ceilings) describes something that looks very much like the alligatoring happening in our house.

Even my 6 and 9 year old daughters understand how it works."
"Thanks for taking a look and the time to reply.This is indeed a picture from the underside, I will update my post to reflect that. I agree they do look thin, I am glad I am not the only one thinking that. I can't add a riser to the front, they are covered in carpet and we are not planning to replace that any time soon unless we have no other choice. These stairs are the only way from our main floor to the floor that has bedrooms so I am looking for a minimal impact repair. Of course number one concern is safety though."
"That makes sense.  Cabinets are expensive, and your kitchen will look great, but it sounds like gap or no gap, that slope will be visible.Is the kitchen ceiling bounded by thresholds?  If so, it seems like a drywall guy aught to be able to level the ceiling.  Either by skim coating the whole thing or building up the highest end with drywall, then skim coating.  Again, I don't know if that's feasible with your kitchen layout, but you might put a post in here about leveling a ceiling.  Somebody should have some ideas."

"You're getting a lot of upvotes, but most tradesmen have to cross trades a bit. Roofers often make their own curbs and crickets. Most of the people in here don't even know what  those  are.Anyway, at least the guy holding the licence **should** at least know a lot about what  the roof attaches to, what penetrates it, what sits on it. They have to work with it, they have the potential to fuck it up.Roofers, carpenters, and architects should know about things they do that makes for a bad roof design, like dead valleys."
"I suggest eye protection, gloves, and a dust mask (or better, a respirator). Good chance mouse pooh and lots of old dust are going to be falling on you. Keep the door to upstairs closed to contain the mess. Buy or rent one of those dumpster bags if it is a lot of drywall or buy good contractor bags. Have a shop vac running to collect some of the dust while you are working. No need for sawzall. Be careful with light fixtures or remove them if needed. If you have smoke detectors monitored by the alarm company, put your system on test and use the covers for your smokes first. Use a hammer and smash some holes in drywall and then grab with your hands and yank large chunks down. Use a cats claw, and sometimes the hammer for extra leverage, to remove the nails that are left.

"I'm a LiftMaster (owned by and same internal parts as Chamberlain) dealer.  Their circuit boards have been going downhill the last few years, as well as wall controls.  You could try to reset the frequency, but more than likely, it's the circuit board.  They got better for a while but we've had to replace three circuit boards within the last few weeks on brand new units.You mentioned it's ""relatively new"".  I would call them and ask for a new head to be sent under warranty.  Just be prepared to sit on hold for about half an hour and know the model and manufacturing date.  They have a pretty good warranty so it shouldn't be an issue getting a new parts.  Also, don't mention the power outage if you don't have to.  I'm not saying lie to them, just don't volunteer the info."
"I've had good luck with a Diablo 5"" diamond angle grinder blade lately on some pretty abusive weld grinding tasks and the recipro blade mentioned before.

I've got recipro, grinder, portaband, and circular at home. But not the rest. And not a great selection of spare drops of nasty metals to try these against.  "
"Right and when he paid for a job both he and the contracted roofer agreed that the job was XYZ (per comments it seems it was $3,500 to remove the old shingles and put new ones in) that deal did not include lumber and labor to reframe a roof. Thatü__s not how it works. Itü__s not like when you buy a used car and it surprises you with a failed transmission a month in, you have to replace it out of pocket to have a car again. As a laborer you get hired for a job, when you get there you do the job you agreed to, you donü__t become beholden to the homeowner for uncovering more severe damage. However, him wanting to just shingle over it would make me be very cautious with working with him. He should have stopped all work and told you heü__d be back when you were done fixing it."
"The previous owner of our house had bamboo installed in the living room and dining room. That was about 3 years ago. It's really scratched up bad now and there's some portions that have deep gouges (probably from them moving furniture). It looks pretty nice  but it's certainly not very hardy. :(We've installed waterproof LVP in three of the bedrooms and it's proven to be far more resilient. I've dropped chisels, hammers, and other various sharp implements all over those floors (I'm clumsy af) and not a scratch on the vinyl. Have also dropped water and paint and it cleans up super easy (just wipes off). Dragged ladders and workbenches, my miter saw, solid core doors all over it and I can't see or feel any scratches.

"There is no risk at all.  Every bag of thinset states acceptable substrates, and exterior grade plywood is  on that list. Of course any substrate must be solidly attached to a solid joist system.  Oh, and plywood is far better at helping with deflection than other substrates.The OP is ready to roll.  Tile time.On a side note, the main reason Ditra and other membranes are so popular is that the manufacturers have spent many millions in making sure all the DIY 'reality' TV programs use those products, often with no purpose or benefit whatsoever.If there is any doubt at all that your substrate is not solid and stable, you should not install tile.  Having a separation membrane is no substitute for a strong base.  And plywood is a strong base and an excellent substrate"
"Well done.   Looking at your photos I would categorize the location of the splice as accessible and easily located so if you need to dig it up again it would be easy to do so. Sharkbites are great butthey haven't been on the market long enough to determine the average service life which is why you wouldn't want to put them inside a wall cavity. That's not to say they won't be a lasting solution. For this applicatiin though, I think it's fine and you went the extra mile with the silicone wrap which will keep the assembly moving as one to reduce micromovements at the joint which will improve the life of the repair.  I wouldn't be surprised if the repair lasts decades.  You can't beat the value of the repair. Be sure to inform the future owner where that splice is located. "
"You did a great job! So glad to see you put in the tie backs. That's what's gonna make that wall last 30-50 maybe even 75yrs or longer if it's regularly maintained and if you can keep the termites off of it. I learned the lesson of fluctuating prices in lumber the hard way too when I built my deck 8 years ago. I started the tear down in March and because I was mostly a single handed weekend warrior it took till June to complete the build. By the time I got around to purchasing the lumber for the decking and handrails it was a lot more than I'd priced it when I began so it threw my budget out of whack by hundreds of dollars. For any future builds I'll buy my lumber in January, February, or the beginning of March at the latest instead of buying what I need when I need it."

"&gt; Even 2m would be generous. I definitely don't have the funds required for engineering like is needed for building skyscrapers in NYC!It's not engineering, there's sheeting panels designed for this.  I merely used that as an example.However, if funds are an issue, the excavation itself will not be cheap.&gt; I looked at the drainage map for the city and didn't see any dwellings without sewer connections, even those in lots which did not adjoin the road.So sewer is going to be a bigger issue than drainage.  Drainage you just need to hit the road grade and it will flow. Sewer you have to have a gravity flow the entire way down to the sewer, which is likely at least a few feet below road grade.I think you are finding out there's a reason why this lot is so cheap.  Not only that, but if you're concerned about engineering costs you likely need permits and engineered drawings from the town.  I'm thinking you may be severely underestimating the costs involved in building a house if trenching is your biggest concern."
"Sorry if I wasn't clear.  So from the boiler, it goes [Ball Valve 1] -&gt;&gt; [Pump] -&gt; [Ball Valve 2] then goes all the way around the zone, at which point there's the Return spigot (usually closed) and then Ball Valve 3 which returns to the boiler loop.  [Here are some extra pics](http://imgur.com/a/EStMYRg).  You can see the hose attached to a return spigot in the second pic.So usually to bleed I close ball valve 3 and open the return spigot, keeping the water topped up with by manually triggering the feed-pressure regulator.What I did was close ball valves 2 and 3, disconnect ball valve 2 from the pump so I could drain there, hook up the garden hose to the return spigot, then open the spigot and then ball valve 2, draining the now-disconnected pipe into a bucket.  So high-pressure garden hose water was going the opposite direction through the entire zone and draining above the pump.  To stop I closed ball valve 2, then the return spigot (so no air got in), then reconnected the pump and re-opened all the valves."
"Consider the path that the appliances will have to be moved through to get to their destination. When I bought my place it came with an old washer and dryer, and I already had a set that I wanted to use. I bought mine from a guy who fixes and sells older washers and dryers (not super old but not new-fangled either). They were in much better shape than the ones that came with the house, so I arranged with the movers that they would move in the ones I owned and take the old ones (they actually said they wanted them, probably to sell is my guess but who cares). Anyway I didnü__t think about the difficulty of getting them down into the basement, which was a very tight fit in both of the landings at the top of the basement stairs and at the bottom. They ended up doing some damage to my wall downstairs.The set that I had moved in is newer than the older ones, but still not super new. No computers in them or anything, easy to fix if they break. I decided that Iü__m going to do whatever I have to do to keep them running until I sell the place, and then theyü__ll be a part of the sale. If I were to end up renting it rather than selling, they will still stay. I would rather have to fix them for the tenants than have them try to move in their own appliances and end up damaging the place like my movers did. So I guess it really depends on a lot of factors, but definitely make sure you consider this when making your decision. It might be easier to just get a used set for a couple hundred bucks and then leave them when you sell/rent. "
"You're opening walls to the dining room and replacing floors in the dining room as well?&amp;#x200B;Was your quote itemized?  Are you going with high end finishes?

"You are far from the bottom rung of society. You're self-employed, which is something most people only dream about. You've simply discovered what other business owners know - it's lonely at the top, and all the burdens of keeping things going are ultimately on your shoulders. If you are overloaded with work, you aren't charging enough. If you need some time today, just tell the guy you aren't feeling well and will have to come back tomorrow. Maybe you need to hire some help, or maybe you're taking on jobs that are too big with not enough time to do them. Use your time today to figure that out. I have had similar thoughts in the middle of projects before, and the best solution for me is to take a breath and remind myself that it doesn't have to get finished today, but I do need to make progress. With progress as the goal, slow down, take your time, and just keep doing little bits that will eventually result in completion. Right now, somewhere there is a surgeon losing a patient on the operating table, a lawyer who can't figure out how to win a case, an accountant trying to decipher someone's disorganized records, a store manager trying to figure out how to run the store when half the crew didn't show up for work, an architect whose plans got rejected for approval, a financial advisor trying to explain to a client why they've lost money, and so on. I don't mean to minimize your problems by an means, but you have a lot of positives. You've managed to stay in business for two years. You have at least one commercial account with repeat business. You have more work than you can get to. You have two years of experience in running a business. This is pretty much the jumping off point. Either scrap all that and start over with something else, or use that to build your enterprise.Sam Walton, who started Walmart and became one of the richest men in the world, used to drive all night in a pickup with a flatbed trailer to buy goods to stock his little store in rural Arkansas, and stock the shelves when he got back. He even slept on a cot in the store sometimes. Work is good for you. At times it is a grind, but idle time isn't healthy. You don't have to insulate an entire building today. You just need to measure for the next piece. Then go cut the next piece. Then put it up. Same with the drywall. You don't have to do the whole job, just measure for the next piece. A couple of hours from now, you'll have more done than you do now. Hang in there, take the weight of the world off your shoulders, and just do what's in front of you."

"OK.  The outside unit unit is called the compressor, the interior unit is the air handler.  The furnace (if you've got one) would be attached to the interior unit.So the power for the blower motor is coming off the exterior unit.

You tell the unit to turn on and off, and this device is what actually does the heavy lifting for you.  May be stuck in the on position.Fairly common.  Moving parts can and do fail occasionally."
"Sorry the stringers are all n the LEFT top side, not on the right.  Some reason I said right in the original post.  You can see those deck steps will be right where a beam would be from the beam plan.  As far as the concrete steps by the slider, yes I don't want to remove them.  There is an existing 4x4 fastened to the top of the steps that acted as a beam for the old deck that was improperly built.  I was going to reuse that portion as a beam for the joists.  The old deck had the decking right on the beams and no joists."
"&gt;electrical tape wrapping a copper crimp around 3 grounds that were twisted together in a boxJust to clarify, was electrical tape the only thing holding the grounds together or was there actually a crimped piece of copper around the wires?Most (all?) US/Canada codes require a mechanical connection for all wires (wire nut, crimp, etc.); you can't just tape them together. In your example, the risk is a wire coming loose and un-grounding part of your circuit.I wouldn't just go around opening everything up if you don't know what you're doing, but yeah all wire connections should be held together with a wire nut, not tape. If you're going to do that, make sure you read/watch a few videos so you know how to properly install one or you'll risk making the situation worse."
"Iü__m a little confused as to what youü__re planning on doing exactly.

Iü__d add furring strips to that wall to make it square at the minimum. But really you need to remove the wood floors and frame out the shower. You need the walls next to it and the RO for all the glass. With all that needs to be done, youü__re better off reframing that whole wall thatü__s out of square. If thatü__s out of the question, you can make new plates that are tapered to what you need to be square, then sistering in new studs and just making that side of the wall square and good to go for the shower.

I would say let the pro evaluate it before going too far, going to brown paper is no problem really as this coat is incredibly forgiving and actually one of my favourite to do for a couple reasons. First it can fix and bring back damn near any wall. Second it leaves the customer with a flawless surface that looks like a brand new wall once primed and painted. I hope that helped!! "
"Problem #1: You have to make the choice on what you want to do. Can't really help you there.Problem #2: I'd add a gutter along the back there. You are getting a lot of moisture running up that back wall. Is the garage just slab? Other option (which would be either more expensive or labor intensive) would be to do some kind of ground covering (I have gravel left over from the driveway behind my garage for this reason. Works OK, but its a metal garage, which also helps avoid the wicking problems.) to allow for quick draining and less splashing.Wouldn't hurt to cut back those hostas so they aren't leaning against your foundation, either. That will be a never ending battle. Had those things up in Maine back in the day. Every other year they would double in size. Its crazy."
"Samsung makes good TVs, but nothing else.I bought an expensive Electrolux gas range with electric convection oven. The oven was excellent ü__ best Iü__ve ever had ü__ but the range sucked the big one. We moved, and our new house came with Kitchenaide appliances, including the range, and itü__s pretty good. It has a bread proofing/warming oven that I never use but would be a god send to bakers. The cooktop is superb: lights instantly every time, five burners including one long one on the left side that can be used as two separate burners or one long grill burner, heavy-duty cast iron grates, and easy-to-clean knobs. The oven is accurate, but it doesnü__t have a temperature probe, which I miss terribly. Overall, I like it fine.My son bought a Wolf. Iü__m deeply envious. "
"So..  Im going out from the window 6 inches, onto the drywall / plaster.   So its easy to adhear to.  So picture the window and 6 inches of the wall on all sides covered.   Its painters tape, so it ""Should"" come off easy.  Also, the walls in this place are due for a painting, filling.  Cracks in the plasters, paint chips.  Its literally a shitty rental house.    I installed an outside security light a few years back (Literally there was no porch light at all) and drilled through the wall in the attic.  Land lord noticed the new light and inquired on how I did it.   It looks fantastic (im honestly proud of it) but he laughed and said ""Well, dont plan on getting any of your security deposit back now then"" ....So.. yah. i really dont give a crap if it marks the walls lol"
"Step things back slowly.  Start at the 10/2 connection to the water heater, and confirm you are getting 250v.  Be safe about this, a 250v shock will seriously injure you.   If you confirm you have a good 250v load (accounting for voltage drop, which should be minimal) then you know the problem is with your water heater.   It sounds like you actually have a water flow issue in addition to your heating issue, and the two are probably closely related.   You said your heater fills fine, but you get little or no flow to hot fixtures (but cold fixtures like the toilet work fine).   All water heaters, even old ones have thermostats, theyre usually integral to the heating element.   These things do break, it could be that you lost a thermostat or an element in the move.   "
"Tile or polishing the concrete are about the only things that would be flood-proof.But vinyl or waterproof laminate or really anything can be fine in a basement if it's not flood-prone and/or if you're willing to deal with it in the unlikely scenario of a flood. Plenty of basements have carpet or laminate or whatever.Vinyl is a fine choice. You can get some that are certified as ""waterproof"" meaning even a total submersion event won't ruin the product. Though in a total submersion event you might need/want to pull it up to dry out underneath it.Any floating floor will need a very flat surface. Vinyl right on slab is fine--but your slab will likely need some prep to be flat enough for floating vinyl. Glue-down vinyl is more forgiving, though also less appealing (imo)."
"Wow... Untouched from the 60s! For lighting, I like the ""disk"" LED fixtures that cost $20-30. The bathroom is very fixable, ""just"" move a wall and put in all new fixtures, including a small size toilet. For the shower, find a shower pan that fits and DIY the cement board and tiling. I had amazing results with a dark  untouched 60s bathroom. (Concrete block walls in the original shower, lol) drywall for the ceiling. Ikea is great for small bathroom sink.Around the furnace, I would remove the ??? Wall, have the furnace serviced, and put in a new wall. Get rid of the basement fridge unless you really need it. Epoxy paint flooring is great. Re: basement bedroom, it needs paint on the panelling and a new floor. Also an egress window if it is going to have long term use. "
"Whoops, read spot check as spot fix. Only just woke up lol, doing the daily run before jumping in the shower.Spacers are useful to prevent slumping, although if you're having problems with adhesive setting off its better to use a longer life adhesive or mix it a bit wetter.First row goes in, although some like to use ledger boards, and then use spacers as you work up. Wedge shaped spaces for ensuring the bottom row is level. Sounds like you've done it the right way, and completely right with dependant on the area to be done. Spread as much as can be handled without adhesive skimming over.Better to use a score and snap cutter instead of a wetsaw (pet peeve of mine). Levelling systems are bloody great on the walls, stop all that slumping and are a key reason why I can work so fast but like everything they have their time and place.Dealing with kids while you work brings up fond memories of my father doing our family bathroom, fun times, keen to watch and get underfoot but they sure don't want to help for long _˘Æ_˘Æ"
"Sand or chemically strip them...clean them really well.  Use a good primer...and a paint made specifically for cabinets.  I used an enamel paint from Sherwin Williams,  and it turned out beautifully.The biggest tip I have for painting furniture/cabinets  (keeping in mind that youü__re new to this) is take your time.  It took me two weeks to paint my cabinets...people think I hired someone because they turned out so well.  Take the door fronts off- take off all the hardware...label your hinges and doors.  Give at least four hours between each coat.  As soon as  I finished applying a coat to all the cabinets, I went back with a dry brush and ran it along all the grooves in the cabinet, and around the edges to keep the paint from collecting into globs.  When you flip your doors to do the other side, give it 24 hours to cure before you flip it, and make sure you put it on something that wonü__t scrape it (I used old towels on paint cans to prop up my doors). When you see drip marks (and you will), use a fine grit sand paper to smooth it out (and then wipe off all the dust).  I ended up applying about 5 coats of thin paint to each piece.  It was painful.  But the more careful you are, the better it will come out.  If you apply paint thickly, youü__ll end up with globs. "
"To be honest, 'sealing' is a wild variable and can mean different products to different tradespeople, so I'm not going to guess at a yes/no answer, instead recommend that you check with the contractor (""I'm concerned about the smell, what product are you going to use to block it and how does it work?"") what product exactly they're using and why - a good tradie is going to be willing to explain what they're doing and why. If it's a primer it needs to be shellac based to stop the smell as far as I'm aware. Alternatively, it's actually something very easy to DIY - just make sure that you do so at a stage of the project that's appropriate (I'd check in with your contractor about when if you're looking to DIY that part), and follow directions on the tin (and remember, you can always re-coat if it seems a bit thin, but you want to let it tack off first).Small dips can be smoothed/leveled out with floor patch compound pretty easily. It's a good idea to get your subfloor in good condition prior to the LVP going down, as you'll probably notice a bit of extra bounce where the hollows are and it may cause problems eventually. As I said, check the manufacturers specs if/when in doubt - they test the shit out of their products and if you're within spec, it's very rare to have problems."
"Michigan Handyman here: your handyman is worried about it freezing and ultimately bursting the pipe in the wall. He's completely justified in warning you about this, that faucet looks to be around a decade-old. And with each passing year the risk of it freezing and bursting increases. You're not high risk at the moment but there is noticeable amounthe woul probably charge you something in the two to $300 range to replace it and the pipe, depending on your state and local pricing. A plumber would probably charge something in the $500 range. If the pipe does burst at some point, water spring inside the wall could cause some serious issues; mold, water damage, flooding extra. long story short if this happens you could expect several thousand dollar bill to repair everything depending on how it burst.in the meantime be sure to turn the supply valve to this exterior faucet off (this will probably be somewhere inside your home, near your main water supply valve). Then open the valve on the external faucet and allow it to drain. This will remove almost a the risk.If you live in northern states where you can experience freezing weather on a regular basis, replacing it now will save you a headache later. They cost a few hundred bucks but it will be cheaper in the long run. on top of that if you use this faucet on a regular basis there are some really impressive options for a new style of garden hose attachment that are vastly better than the faucet.""Will provide a link later don't have it""Hope this helps best of luck."

I use a local door company that machines doors to match. Simply bring them the existing door and they mortise and drill another slab to match.  Usually they charge more for doors that they donü__t provide but it would probably be easiest and cleaniest way to get it done. 
"I went this route, but the biggest drawback is I can't see the front door from my kitchen sink. I had to install one of those expense doorbell cameras just to watch the action. In retrospect, putting the button where I could see the front door may have been a better idea."
I would personally. You can rent a powered snake for pretty cheap at the depot if a $10 hand crank one doesn't do it. Follow the pipe first to see if there's a trap on it. I'd doubt it but would mean standing water is actually OK. If it's getting capped drain it anyways. 
"I would raise that cost estimate significantly here.  Often the fixtures and tile cost $5k alone for a modest level of finish.  But adding drains(often a big deal in a finished space), water supplies, roof vents, wiring, supply plumbing, HVAC........It adds up in a hurry."

Sometimes you can fix it by tightening the packing nut (wrenchable piece the stem of the valve goes in to) or..... sometimes just finding the sweet spot on the valve rather than fully open will work also. Still recommend replacing it. But this could get you out of a bind.

"That area is likely part of the roadway (right-of-way), so digging it up may not be an option. Also, since its probably part of the right-of-way, there is likely utility lines down there (water, cable, electric, ect.) so fitting a French drain might be a little difficult."
That was an estimate for using the nearby outlet. He would have had to cut out about eight feet of lathe-and-plaster and drill through five or more studs to use it though. So we're going to look at different options. I'm not looking forward to fixing that plaster though. 
"The installation manual for your range hood should dictate what size of ducting you need, but if itü__s a high cfm unit itü__ll likely be an 8ü_ù round minimum or itü__s rectangular equivalent. It should be rigid ducting too, less air resistance and less of a grease trap."

"This [video shows how to do it pretty well.](https://youtu.be/1pC2XLzr1Po?t=30).    Basically you just block any air holes with caulk/foam/ Then you stick insuation batts in between the joists and hold them in place with little metal sticks that jam between the joists."

"Your HWT is on borrowed time. Theyü__re engineered to last just past about 8-10 years nowadays in most water conditions. That being said, replacing a T and P is easy and theyü__re cheap (under $20) and if your tank fails soon, you can keep it for a spare on the next tank."

"sounds to me like you have a handle on it, put a beam under all the joists to jack against. I would guess that shimming under the joists at the plate would be as effective as posts etc unless you feel the joists are undersized. No point in trying to straighten the bend..."
"""what is technically subfloor and what qualifies as underlayment?""You have examples of both.  The boards+1/2"" ply are subfloor, the 1/4"" ply is underlayment. Usually 1/4"" (generally  5/16"" here)  ply is GIS-Good One Side. The first two layers are structural, to carry weight and limit deflection.  The 1/4 ply underlayment is likely there to lay linoleum or old VAT at some point in time.  The boards plus 1/4"" ply would be too wavy together, thus the 1/2"". What do you mean by finished floor?  You have underlay and carpet?"
"Easy solution would be to paint all sides then tap in some [nylon furniture glides](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-7-8-in-Nylon-Glide-4609744EB/203670875). That will raise it up off the floor a little.Another option if you don't want a visible gap would be to paint all four sides and caulk the bottom seam. I would run the bead of caulk along the bottom of the wall, then lower it into place. That should make a pretty darn waterproof barrier.But no matter what paint it. That should take care of 90% of your concern."
"Greenhouses have terrible insulation, which you would know if you build greenhouses. The difference in temperature won't be much, and in most cases doesn't justify the cost of the greenhouse. There's always exceptions like trying to grow mangoes in 9a where being 3 degrees warmer might be enough, but in most cases it's not going to make any difference.  Not to mention there are many cheaper options for extended growing season like starting seeds inside at that end of winter and then transplanting them after the frost date."
"Have you tried asking your Trash Company if they provide yard disposal service? Very few know so I asked. In my entire neighborhood, thereü__s only two of us that have it.

"I've used 1/4"" plywood before which doesn't look too nice. Matching hardwood would be better. Either way, you need some decent tools to shape the wood to fit whatever hole you cut out of the cabinet... Hand tools would be a complete pain and probably not very accurate so there would be gaps and the glue wouldn't set up correctly. Which is why I suggest router for removal and table saw to create flat pieces for replacement.Precision is the reason why cabinetry is one of the hardest and most difficult forms of woodworking."
"If you have plaster and lathe walls, either look at your baseboards for the finish nails or pull them off and see behind. Usually they don't lathe all the way down to the floors and leave a gap there. To install my floating shelves where I wanted, I cut a few strips of wood and painted them the same color as my self I was installing so once the shelf was up, you couldn't really tell that it was not on piece when attached.

"You probably need advice from a pro in your area because there are a lot of variables. I recently asked about ductless for a workshop area and was told since I have ducts it would be better to put in a regular system. What they told me was the vent part can only be put on outside walls and you need one for every room. If you have a room with no outside wall, it won't be heated (or in my case, cooled).  In the end it would have cost almost as much as a ducted system and been less efficient. I'm in Texas for comparison. "
"You're missing the math behind the cost. How long will 60K cover the cost of your electricity? If your electricity bill was $300/mo, $3600/year then it'll take 16.6 years to pay off. That's assuming you're paying cash. If you borrow the money then you also have to count interest which I'm not going to take the time to calculate. My opinion: if you are wealthy and concerned about the appearance of your house then the Tesla power roof might be for you. Otherwise, get a good 50 year roof and put typical solar panels on it. "
i hate to say this but it sounds like that floor is going to need to come up.. iü__ve worked in restoration for years and in every situation in which that kind of flooring gets wet itü__s ruined. Another thing to consider is that the water will travel fairly quickly since it is trapped between your flooring and the concrete slab and has the potential to affect a larger area if not dealt with. My advice would be to go ahead and try to find out what the issue is and fix it before it ends up causing more damage. Best of luck!
"the problem with depending on labor from ""friends"" its always secondary priority to to them.  Renovation/remodeling projects put huge strains on couples and it can be just as bad with relations with friends. The big thing here is how to proceed in a manner that you can currently stay in the house and have the work proceed in a timely manner.  That takes lots of knowledge of the processes involved.In a dream situation, a GC would love the owner to vacate the property.  for a number of reasons, most time, its not possible."
"Don't use FlexSeal on drip pans. Spend $100 and get a new one made. A leaking drip pan can cause thousands in damage to your house if the pan is located in or above finished space. This happens relatively frequently with water heaters, air handlers and washing machines in living areas. We just bid an job that has $50k in reno and mold remediation after someone's 2nd floor air conditioner pan was leaking for weeks and the client only noticed when he realized the can lights in his dining room were filled with water. Note: insurance often covers water damage, but not mold bc that's a secondary problem. So, insurance was only covering roughly half. Call a HVAC or sheet metal company and they will custom fabricate a proper metal pan to your size spec for usually $60-$120. "
"Honestly, it depends how fussy you are. I've seen people seal concrete *without even using a grinder*, but to be entirely honest it looked like dogshit. I've seen pros doing it and their results could range from what I'd call poor all the way to amazing. The guys that did a poor job often had issues with the existing floor (i.e varying degrees of hardness across floor, floor being too soft). The guys that had the amazing finishes spent a not insignificant amount of time on grinding and attention to detail - it was comparable to what you'd see in a home magazine finish. If you want that magazine finish look, it's expensive and time consuming. If you can accept a so-so finish, you may not have to spend even half as much time and effort as the guys doing a high quality finish."
"I suppose I fit that description. My painting skills are so-so, maybe a bit above average from having to paint more than the average person, and I have no problem admitting it. For that reason, I use BM Aura exclusively now. Just did my SOü__s condo earlier this year, and she bought a premium paint from Rona. Apparently good shit. I hated using it. I will gladly fork over the extra money for paint that goes on easily, quickly, only needs an hour between coats, and is guaranteed to cover and match for touch-ups. The amount of time and aggravation I save is worth the premium. Those people that are recommending good paint in threads like these understand that the person asking likely isnü__t a pro, or canü__t ü__paint worth shitü_ù, and are trying to help, not being snobby.

"It's not really this job I'm upset at... It's life in general. The system we live in that turns most humans into slaves so that one or two percent of humans can live like gods. I don't really want to be part of this. Someone suggested I hire help, but I feel like a douchebag taking advantage of a system that leaves people desperate for money to eat and have a place to sleep at night.

"Question: If I want the biggest glass-door area on a wall that is non-custom and best value for money, what should I plan to go for?

Single story and shed-roof gable-end, so supporting what's above the door is quite tractable.I must confess that it's the glass-wall look that is my inspiration, but I'm willing to have some stiles and top/bottom rails in view as long as I can get as much glass as possible between a shear-panel at the outside corner and the main house."
"Should be able to. I have a slop sink in between my washer and dryer. The sink itself acts as the drain for the washer. Sink is hooked up normally. Water lines are T'd before the faucets giving the washer it's hot and cold. The washer drain line goes up and curves into the sink with a zip tie holding it in place. The only thing with this setup (and I'm prob going to redo the laundry room anyway) is that you have to cautious with anything that may block the sink drain. Had a small sock cover the drain; wife ran the washer and the sink overflowed. Just tap into the existing water lines for hot and cold. Run the sink drain into the same pipe as the washer drain. No need to reinvent the wheel with creating another drain. Just angle the sink drain pipe so it can do its thing. "

"The leafs/leaves are the individual plates of the hinge. Each hinge has 2 leafs/leaves. You shim behind the leaf of the hinge that is attached to the jam. You can use the door leaf but the jam leaf is easier to work with as it is stationary. The effect is when you place a shim under the leaf next to the stop it pulls the leaf away from the jam slightly causing the leaf to act as a lever thereby moving the pin toward the jam causing the door to shift toward the hinge jam. To move it in the other direction place the shim on the opposite edge of the hinge mortise. This video explains in detail.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-WEM9qN_t4 As it turns out the hinges for that particular door have an internal side to side adjustment and you would not use shims for adjustment.

"A few things... Possible that a over sized furnace already has a hole in the heat exchanger from increased 'wet cycling' and that could be what is tripping the limit, hot combustion gas mixing with the supply air. What is the model and make of the furnace?Was the filter intact when you replaced it?

"Some of the carpet cleaning companies use these big rotary machines that look like hard floor buffers but with soft pads on them.  You don't want those.  I'm not sure if the GP poster was intentionally not posting company names but I don't and never have worked for carpet cleaning companies so I'll do it.  The national brand I have heard of that does the ""buffer"" type cleaning is Chem-Dry.  The national brand company I have heard of that does steaming I have heard of is Stanley Steemer.I've had my carpets done by local franchises of both of these places, and other, local companies using both methods and I'll never use the buffer-type cleaners again.  They run their buffers until there is nothing left on their pads and then it just damages the carpet.  It's clearly operator error but it's happened twice and we just use the steamers (but a local company) now.  The worst they can do is over-soap or under-suck (which leaves it too wet).  We found a local company with a ton of great reviews and have been really happy with them."
"Sometimes this will happen depending on the base used.  If the oops paint was a grayish color and was at the max tint load to get it to that color (different bases are used to make different hues of colors), you canü__t add more without the paint most likely failing on you, smearing all over and not drying properly.  If it was a deeper base that could accommodate more tint, it probably would have been a much deeper color to begin with, most Home Depotü__s donü__t have deep 5 gallon bases though. They might have been making sure they were covered if it messed up your drywall.If it was a 5 gallon of interior paint at THD, it was more than likely a white base which wonü__t allow for very much tint to get close to a dark color. Edit: This is conjecture but if you do end up going in on a different shift, be careful because they may do it for you and it may end up messing your walls up. To cover yourself, look at the label and see how many ozü__s tint is already in there, and see how many the 5 gallon base recommends at max."
"Sorry, didn't mean for that to come off the wrong way. I come in peace. Your correction is correct and my way of trying to explain it was wrong. All good... We are currently on a single story ranch (slab, no basement) with boiler in attached (unconditioned) garage so I often forget that in my mind I have a hard line (firewall between house and garage) where conditioned/unconditioned spaces come together. Then for us, because of the slab, all of our hydronic pipes run up and across the attic and then drop down through the walls to each room.

"I gave gas tankless. The only occasional issue: Tankless water heaters often have a minimum flow rate that they can heat. There are limits on how finely the heating system can modulate, so if if tries to heat a very slow trickle of water it would make it dangerously hot.

"Being a commercial model, it was only available to purchase by our plumber and not me directly. It was a Takagi gas water heater. We went with gas because it is cheap in Kentucky.

"I agree they did a terrible job, but it does look like there is some existing subbase there... the quality and depth of it should have been determined prior to install.Of course, this may be irrelevant to your next step because the lack of compaction leaves the driveway vulnerable no matter the subbase situation. Id also be worried about puddling based on how it was hand graded. I also think they butchered the matchline... I would want a clean sawcut match to the existing pavement. That seam will only get worse otherwise."

"I built UP my patio so that it would have a high section, near level with the back door of the house.  As for why, because it makes the space more usable.  Stairs are a pain when hands are full, or lots of people around etc.The single use case that made most sense to me:  Imagine a small child is against a door that swings out to the deck, how do you get them out of the way without accidentally pushing them down two stairs?  Having a single level removes that issue.  (as does a sliding door, but i don't have that ability)"
"I do not know why you are being downvoted. Probably by people who don't know what they're talking about, honestly. Yes, there are SOME roofers out there who just do the grunt work of roofing and don't know anything beyond that, but a competent roofing crew will always have some guys who know how to make simple carpentry and framing repairs like this. THIS SHIT IS BASIC, EVERYONE. If this roofer has literally no idea how to make some rafter tail repairs, he's not a very smart person or hasn't been doing this trade very long."
"I'd get a quote from a well-reviewed handyman if you're strapped for time, but it's a simple DIY job. A few years back before we owned our home we rented a brand new ""garden level"" (fancy wording for basement) unit and the windows didn't have screens. I'm OK with spiders, but I don't need 100 of them in my house all the time, so I just bought the frames/screens. It took me about 4 hours to make 8 screens. Make sure your windows have the insets to accept screens - if they're wooden windows from the 1920's you're out of luck."
"I've gone so far as done a video recording walkthrough of the entire unit on move in day, calling out any potential preexisting issues. Then I send the video to the landlord, noting the issues from the video, and ask them to reply and confirm that they've watched it and agree these aren't my fault. Then you have it on paper in case they come after you for it later (which they honestly might not remember talking about it if you stay for more than a year or two, don't assume they're trying to fuck you, just get it in writing)"
"It seems to me that the quickest and easiest solution is to put it right into the recycle bin with other junk mail and not worry about it.  For me, all of my bills are paperless, so if I don't get junk mail, I don't know if the mail has been delivered yet, so I think of it as acknowledgement that the mail has come.Returning it seems to be a waste of energy and money, as the companies that send it pay so little, it's not worth it for the post office to deal with it, and the senders probably don't care either in most cases."
"They can get SERIOUSLY annoying and it's EXTREMELY detrimental to productivity. One time I had a basement drop ceiling job. It was for a retiree, and he sat on a chair the entire time watching me do the entire job from start to finish.

I was doing mental/verbal ballet around landmines while trying to focus on what I was doing."

"As others have said, you have cold water coming in to replace the hot you took out. If the burners can't keep up which its unlikely they would at that rate, then you will get to luke warm water in probably ten minutes.  You really need double that size (80 gal) which is standard for single family home thats normally expected it would run multiple (low flow) showers in the morning.  On demand water heaters get pricier the more flow/min you need. I see on the tag now it says recovery rate is 30.5 gallons/hour and your showerhead is 2.4/min = 144gallons/hr....it will never catch up. You need to start with a larger tank or lower the flow if you want steady hot water. Just lowering the flow, would need to reduce the flow to 1/2 gal/min to maintain constant hot water production."
"Careful relying on colors; these are NOT safe guides in older construction. There are also DIY electrical jobs done by overly-ambitious novices that disregard colors completely. If you are inspecting/replacing an outlet yourself, it is safest to shut off power to that circuit, remove the wires from the device (outlet), separate them as much as possible, turn the power back on, and carefully test each with a voltage detector. Carefully mark which wire(s) is hot/electrified (with electrical tape around the casing), then shut the power back off before you continue with your project. There are many video tutorials that can walk you through this. Please check with your city/county/parish code for guidelines re: permits. Some seemingly small electrical repairs require permits."
"Hey, I just moved here and I have to abide by the rules of said eco system.  The cat looks old enough to have been around for a while, so I accept that I am part of ITS eco system. What I am proud of is that the cat doesn't kill ALL birds or ALL little  lizards, evident by the plethora of sightings, so I still have an eco system despite the cat. Plus my partner loves cats and I am amused that this cat (and the scrappy other cat that comes around once in a while) both prove that cats are assholes.

"Main breaker panels outdoors are oddly standard in some regions, and not just dry ones- mine included.The only breakerbox to our house is located outside on the side of the house, immediately next to our meter- which makes it a giant friggin PITA to flip any switches when you pop a breaker in the middle of a thunderstorm. Can't for the life of me figure out why anyone'd think it'd be a good idea to mandate they go on the exterior (especially in Tornado Alley, of all places)... But that's the city ordinance, so we can't touch it.My in-laws' the next town over, though, have theirs in an interesting place: The basement stairwell... Halfway up the wall... So you need a ladder ON THE staircase... In order to reach it. Why, I don't know. But that's where it is for some reason."
"Right now I have a small shelf in the guest bedroom for towels and washcloths, and the extra sheets/bedding are in that bedroom's closet.The previous owners raised two kids in this house for 25 years and it couldn't have been fun with neither a linen closet nor a pantry.  The pantry is a whole other story.  The previous owners had stored food in the closet under the basement stairs (and I've seen a mouse in the basement, so that's a big NO for me, thanks).  I took out a kitchen wall so that I could put in an 18"" wide pantry cabinet plus a small base cabinet that would actually store my cookware (none of the existing base cabinets were wide enough for a medium-sized skillet).  It's a 1500-square foot house built in the 1980s.  The storage situation shouldn't be this dire!"
"All good advise but if your only painting rooms in your house how the hell is he suppose to practice?  A 30$ brush will help but won't make cutting in any better. It takes practice. The key is to tape is a clean surface. If its dirty the tape won't stick. Even if it looks clean wipe off the dust. If your walls or ceilings have medium to heavy texture the paint is always going to sneak behind.  I always use 1.5 in blue tape. Additional step if your good with a caulk gun is to put a thin bead over the taped edge and rub it in to fill the gaps behind the tape. Let it set up for 25 to 30 minutes and then paint. This method really works when doing stripes.  If your taping off baseboard or crown or casing make the extra effort to really press down the tape. Make sure the other side of  the tape is pushed down. Tarps can pull the tape off or your foot (baseboards) while underneath when rolling. Don't flood the roller and start at the walls where the tape is, start further away and use a brush if you can for the taped offed areas. "
"Before we poured the concrete leading up into the garage, I had an electrician run a line out To my garage Under ground (itü__s detached) for an electrical sub panel. The previous owners had a line that ran from the home overhead into the top of the garage that looked really ugly, it was hanging low too, so it always felt dangerous to me, but Iü__m not an electrician so what do I know. The line fed into that 1 light that was in the middle of the garage, and that was it. Previously my garage didnü__t have any electrical outlets, so I had the electrician put 1 in, and since the garage was still a mess at the time, I didnü__t have him do more.Later i ended up adding a breaker for the recessed lights, and 1 for the outlets that I ran prior to the drywall. I think I added 6 double electrical boxes for outlets (not sure the proper name) so each one has 2 outlets, each one is piggy backed off the previous so they are all run serially. The electrical panel is on the left side next to the entry door, canü__t be seen in any pic. "
"Good suggestions. The list is an odd level-setting of goals in my mind (DIY+hobby woodworker checking in). From a DIYer perspective, most tools I purchase are not lumber prep, but my woodworking tools are almost all lumber prep (example - planes, router, chisels, card scrapers, and i have a 14"" rikon bandsaw but the laguna 14bx would have been a smarter choice). So it's an overkill list by a wide margin for renovating, but I don't think it hits most of the tool requirements I would personally set to build a table. I think your first point is perfect, buy as you need. It does end up costing more up front but you have less unused stuff laying around, which ends up being most efficient as long as you plan each purchase.I would also disagree about the miter saw, but only due to the amount of trim work it seems like s/he has lined up. People way overshoot how a miter saw should work which makes them less useful. Single bevel, non-sliding. You don't to spend $1400 on a kapex for accuracy, just need simple rigidity -https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-15-Amp-Corded-12-in-Heavy-Duty-Single-Bevel-Compound-Miter-Saw-DW715/100384715Also, if you are doing a lot of tile, this thing with a good blade is fantastic -https://www.harborfreight.com/10-in-25-hp-tilebrick-saw-69275.html"
"This.I just picked up a DF304 off of Craigslist and have no regrets.It is 8 years old and in mint condition. It is by far the best cooking oven I have ever seen. Chocolate chip cookies baked using the convection feature, something we never used on our old Dacor, resulted in perfect cookies that did not have to be turned halfway through baking. The simmer on the top is excellent. Again, something that my old Dacor really sucked at. Some people may scoff at me for buying a used Wolf.  However, it is designed for 20+ years of commercial use. We cook... A LOT, as food has been a hobby for me and my wife for years. The Dacor we just got rid of was completely clapped out and there were absolutely NO parts available for it after 5 years.  Wolf is committed to making parts for years.  There are two things that I do not like about it though. 1. Installation is a bitch.  The DF304 (30"" and the smallest they make) weighs in over 350 pounds.  Also, the gas and electric have to be position within a very narrow area, for the range to fit up against the wall.  Electricity doesn't bother me and I moved the 240V outlet myself, then had it inspected. But gas is another matter and I especially have no knowledge of handling the bendable stainless steel line, so I spent the $130 for a plumber to come out and position that properly. 2. This is more of a nitpick, but I wish the gas valves for the cook top had greater range of motion.  Small movements of the knobs, equals a large change in temperature.  My old Dacor had a huge range of motion on the knobs, to adjust burner temp.  As I use the Wolf it is getting better.  In a few years I will probably stop whining about it. With that said, it is a great piece of equipment and I look forward to cooking on it for the next 20+ years. "

"It connects to the main stack. That's how it's vented. It *should* be connected above the soil line so it's not wet vented, but it often isn't because basement bathrooms often don't get used much. That's typical for basement fixtures. Might I ask: why does it need replaced?"
"It's great if you're at a point where you can comfortably assume that the basement will never flood.I personally just can't live that way. Maybe it's my region, or just the stuff I've owned/dealt with... But Basements are inherently prone to getting wet in my experience. "
"Much more expensive and usually can't be used on their own, no? But they make them in 1/4"" hex drive and I like those, usually you get them in a kit with a bunch of other bits.I will admit the socket ones come in handy more than expected, but usually just in metric sizes."
My wife has a Rainbow vacuum. It has a tub of water in a basin in the bottom of it instead of a filter. She sucks up creepy crawlers in it and they spin around in the water and die. They are expensive but I'm sure there is a cheaper alternative that has a water basin in it.
No problem.  We have a few of them in our house and so far they have held up very well for several years.  They do a very good job of blacking out the light.  If you can buy a size you don't need to cut that's better as cutting them down was the biggest pain of the install.

"As others said, flex seal is the wrong solution, when I did my bathroom I used red guard which is actually rated for what you mention, it goes under the tiles. Someone who wants to use flex seal seems like they don't know what the hell they are doing.Anyways, to me it sounds like your floor pan failed, you need to rip up the floor to find out how deep it goes and remove it, and then replace it the right way. There is no repairing it, that floor needs to be ripped up and stuff removed until you find how deep the water went."
"Cheap LEDü__s are cheap for a reason. The controllers are garbage and will burn out quick.Biggest mistake people make is not looking at specs. LED lights have specific install parameters and are more strict than incandescent and CFL. You need to make sure you install the right bulb in the right place.

Likewise a bulb over your stove needs to be ok with humidity or boiling water will shorten its life."
"Find your studs. I'm sure snap toggles may work, but for peace of mind, I would find the stud.Look at your outlet at the bottom right.

"I can't speak to the CO2 emissions from installing bamboo floor. However, I would be cautious when choosing it because it is a fairly soft wood. I grew up with it and it was constantly being scoffed/boards having to be replaced. This is for a family of four (and a 10lb dog that once scoffed it by dragging his leash), so your mileage may vary. However, I would still strongly consider the wear and tear it will sustain from your daily life. A less sustainable material that has a longer life could end up being more eco-friendly."
"I'd say since you live there now, you should enjoy living there now.  Put in the countertops that you will get the most joy out of using.  Besides, your circumstances could change 5-7 years from now and you might not move after all.  If you want to instead prioritize resale value over personal enjoyment now, then I think it makes sense to wait a few years and see what's trendy then.  Last I heard, granite countertops were just now starting to become less trendy.  (Or rather, that butcher block was becoming *more* trendy.)"
"I'm telling you about a trend that's becoming more common in the States, not what happened at your house.

"If it were my house I would use a 2x8. Framing lumber smaller than that is SPF (spruce, pine, fir) where as 2x8 and larger is SYP (southern yellow pine). The SYP lumber is much stronger, and as several others have pointed out, if you're using these to level the floor, the strength of the member matters (to a point).If using a nail gun, I would use 16d nail equivalents in a W pattern spaced 10-12"" on center. Screws or bolts work too, but nails are fast and cheap. Regardless of what you use, you should fasten in a W pattern."
"Not an electrician but...Is the device UL-listed? If yes don't fuck with it. If no, return and find one that is.I suspect the reason they can use aluminum wiring is because it is not a high power device. Aluminum expands more than copper when it heats up which results in loose connections when connected to copper. It also oxidizes faster which creates more resistance and therefore more heat. As a low power device neither of these things are really an issue. It doesn't use enough power to significantly heat up the wiring."
"Quick question. When you clean your shower, do you also clean the caulk? And do you use bleach when cleaning the shower? Bleach will kill the mold.

"Thanks for the suggestion of an engineer....not a bad idea.We've already been tossing around the larger water line, so that is on our radar.That's the other thing about the sewer. The property is extremely flat. The potential build site to the street is about a 1 foot drop. Based on my math, we'd need at least 20some feet worth of drop in order for a gravity system to work.

"You see stab-backs a lot in the cookie cutter subdivisions regardless of home value. It urks me when I go in to a half million dollar home to fix switches or outlets and they bought the cheapest ones they could and wired them using the stab-back.       Also, when making the loop put it on the screw oriented the same way as the screw tightens so that as you tighten the screw you draw the wire in instead of forcing it out. Basically if the screw tightens clockwise, which most do, your loop should be going clockwise as well. "
"share the street view, it's very easy to tell the difference between exposed fastener and the other two, however the other two are hard to tell apart with out getting up closer. But both are much better than exposed fastener, with standing seam being the best. To give an example, I had my relatively small roof quoted for both architectural shingles and standing seam. It was $5000 vs $12000. I ended up going with the shingles cause they have a 30 year warranty and we don't have hurricane or tornado type winds where I live. "
"1. Green tank is the expansion tank. Connect a bike pump to the valve on the bottom, and it should read a similar pressure to the system pressure. I think you can add air if it's low2. This shows zone valves and a circulator pump on the right.3. Upper right is a temperature pressure relief valve. It doesn't do anything unless things get really bad. But sometimes it might leak. And it will drain somewhere.4. On the right that is a pressure regulator. On the left I'm not sure, read the label.Look for an air separator. If you don't have bleed valves, the air separator theoretically gets the air out.It's probably worth having someone come out and check the system, explain how it works, and see if they can reduce the noise. But it can be hard to get rid of all the noise."
"Damn, thought for sure that was the ticket.  If there were a set screw in there it'd be right inside that notch- I can't think of any other reason for that little cutout to be there at all.  Maybe the notched ring rotates and there's a set screw elsewhere on the perimeter? I might be totally wrong but I'd check thoroughly.If you're replacing it, it'll involve some re-plumbing anyway, right?  Is there a panel or something you can remove to access this from the plumbed side? The whole thing may be bolted on through the wall from the back.I would advise against forcing it too much if you can- if you get too forceful with it and damage the tile or drywall, it's gonna complicate your project. At a certain point you might have no choice, but brute force would be my last resort."
"In no way would you ever bid a job to install a fence knowing you're going to misalign the gate. That's just a horrible assumption. Modular or not, you would never do this AND if you have no other options, you MUST disclose this. Must.No homeowner would ever accept this. No homeowner would know this is the guaranteed outcome of this type of fence, nor should they. No homeowner would or should have the foresight to predict this outcome.This contractor is being lazy. Cut the gate in the right down to match. He can obviously cut and miter fence panels because he did already on the far left. ""Structural Integrity"" is what he's saying because it's a serious phrase that makes people back down.This homeowner needs to demand it be fixed regardless of the contractor objections. "
"If you are going for a modern and industrial vibe what would you do instead?  How high is your ceiling?  I personally think itü__s a requirement and it is not outdated at all, at least in my area.Just note you want layers of light (so not just recessed, but also have fixtures  and lamps of some type in living room, under cabinet in kitchen)Also be careful of the color of light and try to match.  If you are looking for industrial look you are going to want ""cooler"" light, maybe 4000 Kelvin, 4500 Kelvin tops if you don't want it to look like a hospital.As to burning out easy, um no.  All the recessed lights you should be considering now would include LED trims and those last so many hours.  I have yet to replace any of the ones I have put in in 7 years.For LEDs consider the color of the light that I already mentioned, but also think about the CRI.  Min you want is 80, kitchen you might want 90+.  I like Juno cans myself.  They have all sorts of choices for LEDs and they also have ones that dim to warm if you want that."
"You are doing the correct thing, getting her tested.  I am not a physician, and this is not a medical opinion.  But I'm willing to bet you that she will have very low or no measurable amount of lead in her blood.  (Which is 5 micrograms per deciliter (Ùëg/dL), the reference level at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated).Lead can and is dangerous, but by and large it has been grossly overblown.  If a child were to eat leaded paint chips, it could require hospitalization, or worse.  But dust, in and of itself, does not have anywhere near the concentrations that the paint chips have.   She'd have to build big piles of dust and eat it.  She did not do that, did she?You can clean this up, if you are smart about it.  Moistened paper towels are excellent at grabbing and holding the dust, so that it can be disposed of.  You can dump the used towels into contractors garbage bags, ready for disposal.  You can use a HEPA equipped shop vac to clean out your ductwork and other hard-to-get areas:  https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-14-gal-HEPA-Wet-Dry-Vac-RV2400HF/202507683I am *not* dismissing the lead danger, but I am also not treating it as if it was some radioactive contamination.  Lead can and should be cleaned up, but this may not be as bad as you might fear."
"If you are at least somewhat handy, and are willing to learn how to do new stuff, go for it! Although quite challenging, it was really fun and extremely rewarding.Now if I was to redo it, there's a few things. I made a mistake with the wood in the kitchen and dining room area that caused a bit of frustration, so I would take my time and make sure I am accurate with my work. I would also be more open to asking for advice, as I made assumptions on how to fix problems with drywall, and it made much more work for me. There was a much easier solution, I was just impatient and decided to go with my ideas instead. In terms of what different choices would I have made:I decided to run a small copper tube along the walls from the sink to the opposite wall for the fridge water supply. There were a few better options that I should have considered, but didn't go for any of them. (I could have ran the same tube under the floor to the other side, and had it come out behind the fridge, or I could have run a new water line from the sink or even the nearby bathroom to a special fridge water line connection behind it. That would be a much cleaner and much more permanent solution. I would have also considered changing out the tile around the fireplace at the same time. I know we want to do it, but just wanted to get everything done at that time. Other than all of that, there isn't much that comes to mind on what I would do differently. I'm sure I'll come up with more later today, but all I know is I am very happy with the finished product!"
"You'd need to look at the original contract documents to find out how far below the surface the perimeter drain was installed (if at all).  Then you could carefully dig down to ensure that the drain is there - being careful not to damage any waterproofing that's hopefully on the exterior face of the basement wall.  Repair any damaged waterproofing and perforated perimeter drains, then correct grade to prepare for the slab.The stuff above is less relative to concrete finishing, and more relevant to excavation/site work - though many general contractors do both.  As for questions to ask your contractor to ensure you get a good concrete guy:1) How do you plan to cure the concrete? -If they don't have an answer at all, move on to another.  You're looking for someone with a curing plan (something like a curing compound, blankets, wet cure - at least SOMETHING)2) When and how do you plan to install joints in the slab?  -If they tell you it won't need joints because it won't crack - move on to another.  You're looking for either tooled joints in fresh concrete (in my opinion the prettiest option and definitely the best in regards to crack control activation assuming the tooled joints are deep enough) or saw cutting within 12-24 hours after pouring.3) What mix will you be using? I can't give you a good answer here because I don't know what climate you're in - but they should have a ready answer here, and shouldn't be caught off guard by the question - that would be a bad sign.4) Can you show me some photos of your past work?  This is good, but not a for sure thing.  Often slabs can look great a week after they're poured (when most photos are taken) and then scale to after the first winter.  Bonus points if they can direct you to look at some old work to see how it's holding up."

Off topic but you seem to be in the business.   I've got Plethora of 2 prongs and the last electrician I had out quoted me at 42 bucks per outlet to replace these with 3 prongs.   Do you think that sounds reasonable? I don't think I know nearly enough to try this on my own.

"&gt; Please be careful about making too many assumptions based on just a snippet of code referenceThis is what I struggle with the most.

"I wish I could say the same thing. When I bought my house I was renting a place with a full 2 car garage with quite a bit of extra length. House I bought has 1.5 car garage with limited length due to water heater and hvac. The other half got taken up with a bathroom remodel that Iü__ll eventually tear out and rebuild to itü__s smaller footprint.  I used our rental for hobbies, storage and cat litter, when we moved I didnü__t consider that my husband would actually want to park in it. Now all my shits piled up along the walls."
"Oh I wasn't thinking to insulate the whole attic. I've actually got a shear wall going down the length of the house that sticks up ~4 ft into the attic, and provides a nice corner in which to place ducting and box it in with insulation. A good thought though - the less surface area the better.Annoyingly, my attic does not have any soffit vents, so the only air flow is through some gable vents and a few roof vents. I was thinking about installing soffit vents (with baffles in the attic) to get some stack effect in the attic."
"So I'm in kind of a similar situation and looking to buy all new cabinet doors to refresh things.My plan is to buy them pre-painted (the company will spray them at the factory) and in the meantime sand/prime/paint my boxes to match.For the boxes, is a sprayer a necessity, or will I be able to get by with a roller/brushes?I'd honestly just prefer to find someone that deals with this and throw money at them, but everyone I've found in Chicago is booked for 6+ months solid, and most only refinish rather than replace doors."

"That's unfortunate. You could look for slightly smaller doors and use larger trim to cover the gaps.You could also look into what would be involved in widening the opening.  I've seen houses that were framed with standard sized openings but when smaller doors were used the openings were packed down to size.  If this happens to be the case with your door it might not be to hard to return it to a standard size.  Unfortunately the only way to find out is to tear open the sheetrock around the door to get a look at the framing. "
"There was not any wallpaper there before.. There was wallpaper all around it, but not in that area. It looks like they peeled the facing (decorative side, don't know the name?) then realized it was too difficult and gave up.. and maybe primed or plastered over what was left behind?

If it'd help I can take a closer up photo?"
"Usually old houses have shitty old wiring and ungrounded outlets in insufficient numbers, no insulation in the exterior walls, and yeah, they just generally look crappy.  Replacing with drywall is your chance to fix all of that.  Good opportunity to add recessed lighting, ceiling fans, cat5, etc.  removing plaster is a lot of dirty, heavy work, and it sucks.  Putting up drywall is easy sam fun though.  Get yourself an actual drywall gun and youü__ll be glad you did.  Get yourself an auto feeder and youü__ll be even gladder.  "
"What kind of pool is it? I would be concerned if it's completely empty. A lot of pools aren't designed to be empty; I've worked on a couple houses that had the walls bow in from the lack of water pressure helping keep the walls up.  In some places like in FL, I've seen fiberglass pools just pop up into a backyard.I'm also in ATL so I don't think the second scenario is likely to happen, but you should definitely get someone out there to check it out.  Source: Licensed GC that's seen a lot of shitty houses from 08/09 crash."
"Yeah, it sucks knowing that there's some wasted money here, but the bright side is he didn't get all the way to done, and end up with you having to tear out the shower in a few months because of the bad, leaky work.

Not only do they pull out more easily, they are not for wet areas and will rust out.&amp;#x200B;Honestly, seeing what he's done so far, I would not trust this guy to have the level of knowledge necessary to do the shower.  Really sorry you have to deal with this."
"Yes, that's possible.I would rip up all the carpet first--just wiggle the large stuff out of the way to get the carpet underneath it.Then you can assess the subfloor situation and make sure it meets specs for the laminate. If it does, you can start laying it, then move the large furniture on top of it when you have passed enough laid. No big deal. Put some felt pads under your furniture to protect the laminate. You can get shaggy slider pads, too, if you're going to have to be pushing this furniture around multiple times."
"After having used both, Ecobee hands down for remote sensing if there is any special cases or more than 2 rooms. Nest for single thermostat.The Ecobee allows significantly more control on what sensors are used and when. It averages the active sensors so only the areas you care about control the heating schedule. With the averaging it doesn't really need individual room control.Nest only allows switching between a single active sensor throughout the day. So if you have just a living room and bedroom it could work decent. I don't like that Nest only let's you change sensors by their schedule, not your own. If you have a weird schedule that can be bad. Works well for 8-5 though.I say Nest for a single thermostat because the schedule is way easier to setup and more flexible."
"Akron here, too! I'm over on Lansing in Ellet. And agreed - it's nuts that the expansion joint all popped like that. It almost looks like there wasn't enough gravel under it when it was poured and the whole walk went and shifted, pushing the joint out. But it's weird for somewhere that hot and dry... I'd expect to see that around here haha. Looks to be finished settling, though. I figured Sika was overkill, given OP's climate. Question since you're around these parts: any idea where I could get a good price on some caps for the [retaining wall](https://i.imgur.com/1fbBvvG.jpg) I built two years ago after the old neighbors backed over the old one?

It hasnü__t harmed my wood floors and the dogs arenü__t moving rugs all over. Works for tile floors and wood floors. Itü__s cheap. And if you donü__t like it for the rug issue you can use it in drawers and cabinets. You can wash it in the washing machine and let it air dry. It works under runner rugs because itü__s long and narrow, or you can trim it and make a more square shape by laying two rectangular pieces side by side. "
"Awesome.  There are some potential unknowns I'd like to throw out there.  Not because I disagree in any way but because I have a chance to talk to someone that actually cares. Are there maybe some ""loads"" that a 1.6gpf will perform better? We don't have to worry about the 100 year shit storm or anything.  No toilet is built for that.  But maybe the 2 or 4 week shit storm is worth considering.  I mean,  an extra flush in 4 basically nullifies any benefit here.  Also,  assuming you have freshly installed 3"" abs pipes with a proper pitch, 1.3 should be more than adequate to keep your pipes from forming plaque but if you have Any bellies or joints with to much glue or even worse, steel drain pipes,  would a the extra pound of water every flush keep everything running smoothly?"
"If you've got something rusty like a gate hinge, WD40 works great to loosen up and push out the rust build up. But then you should use a longer lasting lubricant such as oil or grease. If you don't, then the rust will be back very quickly. WD40 is also great to use when you want to keep something from rusting temporarily. Like if you're working on a metal project, but it's not ready for paint. The thin film wd40 leaves behind helps prevent oxidation.Thin lubricants like silicon and tri oil are usually used with thin clearances and parts that move/rotate quickly. You need to keep these areas clean from dirt and debris though. Requires more maintenance than grease.Grease is great for dirtier environments that wont be maintained often. Used for slower moving/rotating parts."
"It is a good thought in theory but what you are forgetting is the paint is also drying over the tape.  The paint on the tape is also the paint on the wall.  Think about peeling paint off your skin.  Sometimes you can rip it off in sections (or like dried glue).  That is what happens when you let it dry on the tape and then take the tape off.Might be a little too late but if you find yourself in this same situation, take a razor to the edge to cut the paint on the wall away from the paint on the tape.The previous owner of my house did the same thing.  I've been in my house for over 2 months and have still yet to fix it.  To make it look smooth you have to sand the area, prime it if you see any of the drywall, putty it smooth, sand it again, prime it again and then paint it."
"Mostly this but I would change one thing. Donü__t use a chisel on the hinge mortise when you are adjusting the reveal. Hinges have four screws per leaf. The midpoint between these screws is a fulcrum. Use cardboard shims, dense like shoebox is best. Cut strips approx 1/4ü_ù-3/8ü_ù wide and as long as the leaf, probably 4ü_ù for this hinge. To move the door closer to the hinge jam place a shim or two underneath the leaf along the stop side of the mortise. To move the door toward the strike jam place a shim or two under the leaf at the edge of the mortise closest to the pin. This will shift the slab left or right as is needed. For best door function make the reveal even all the way around the slab. Pretty sure the adjustments youü__ve been attempting are for a spring mechanism. "
"Single plate on bottom. Use a foam product called ""Sill seal"" underneath it. Both sides and the bottom need to be pressure treated because they rest against concrete if your garage is foundation poured. Single top plate. Since most of this wall is windows, I recommend just building it in place. None of your framing needs to be load bearing as the former header carries the load for the entire opening. In fact, if the windows are all tue same size, I would frame it from the double sill down. Then you have one opening from.the sill to the header for the windows. This will keep rigidity in a wall that otherwise would be separated posts and king studs. Now you can do your math and just frame in side trimmers between window openings. Sheet the exterior, wrap it with membrane. Ta da."
"Yeah, I live in a railroad town and there's a stretch of Union Pacific freight yard that is 17 tracks wide.I live in a hilly town in the Rockies, with plenty of tree cover between me and the tracks.  I live in a little depression/bowl and don't even have line of sight with the tracks.It's mostly just at night when you hear them and it isn't loud enough to really bother you.  More than anything, if I'm laying there trying to fall asleep it sounds like a teenage neighbor is sitting in their car listening to the radio with a subwoofer.  Just a low, rhythmic sound, but it's the train engines throttling up.  You can hear the boom of them linking cars, too.And I lied; it isn't quite 3 miles, but damn near 2.5 miles, as the crow flies.  I wasn't positive so I just confirmed it."
"Check out the third video in the OP. Basically I cut two cheap 1ü_ùx8ü_ù boards down to true 1ü_ùx7ü_ùs for the top and bottom of the shelf. Then I cut a bunch of 1ü_ùx1ü_ù that are about 5ü_ù long to glue and nail on the top of the bottom board. Since my shelves are 60ü_ù long, I think I put 5 of them evenly spaced. Leave several inches from the side edge to the 1""x1"" so it looks like you have an open side. I glued and nailed down the top board to sandwich the 1ü_ùx1ü_ù pieces and capped the front with a 2 1/2ü_ù select pine since thatü__s what will be visible. The top and bottom board were cheap pieces since the shelves were going to be placed at eye level and above so the top and bottom werenü__t going to be too visible.    Edit: I forgot to mention how I mounted them lol. I fixed 1""x1"" to each side of the wall with two 75 lb toggle bolts each. Then, I just slid in the shelves so the 1""x1"" fixed to the wall goes in between the top and bottom of the shelves (remember, the sides and back are open. Only the front it covered)."
"I can take some pics in the morning when itü__s light out again.

We tried hanging the box up ourselves, but it appears that there is nothing to really drill into with the bolts to hang up the box and then the fan.It looks like after researching online people use fan beams inside the awning. They didnü__t here so his suggestion is to bolt through the top of the awning to secure that box as opposed to bolting it to a beam."
"Tell them, when you meet them, that you require a detailed proposal.  If they don't give you one, cross them off the list, and get another from someone else.  Expect lots of people to never give you a quote, and lots of half-assed responses.  A lot of contractors get away with not providing details, and can't do it.  A lot depends on the size of the job, it's not worth it for small jobs.   If the gutter job is ""fix this ten foot section that's busted, and reattach a downspout"", you're not getting details.  If the job is replace them (or insatall them for the first time), it's perfectly reasonable to expect a proposal that says something like ""install approximately 100' of 5"" seamless aluminum gutters, three downspouts, layout to match exisiting gutters"" and if you say yes, a contract that spells out more detail.  The person doing the estimating has to know what he's planning on using, or he couldn't give a reasonable price.  Not wanting to tell the customer always makes me suspicious that the plan is to do substandard work."
"Yes, if you consider yourself pretty handy. We spent about $600 refinishing our entire 3 bedroom house. That includes the rentals, the sandpaper, and poly. We started with a random orbital sander, but that took too long and didn't do that good a job (our floors were god awful). We rented a drum sander for a second weekend and it worked like a champ. We also got 2 5gal buckets of unopened poly for $100 at Habitat for Humanity, so that really cut down the price. It was well worth it. My friend just got her living room and dining room professionally done for $2000. It also really depends on your home value. We purchased our home this spring for $86k, now that we've spent $10k in (mostly) diy renovations, we can expect at most $120,000 when we go to sell in 5 to 10 years (maybe $135k when we level out the backyard, get new windows, and install ac). If you have a $250-500k home, definitely go for a pro. When people are paying a higher price, they expect higher quality work. Edit: here's our dining room http://imgur.com/a/mXt73us"

"&gt;lol yay I got old stuff!  No, the life expectancy on the panels is about 30 years, at which point they become less efficient (and presumably technology will have improved to teh point where upgrading the panels will produce a lot more electricity and will save you money"
"A handyman friend of mine uses an app called Thumbtack. I believe you post pictures and describe work, and then different people bid on the job for the price they are willing to be paid. He does larger things, mostly full bathroom remodels, but it might be worth checking out."

"Delay the work. DO NOT give them any money. Get more estimates. Why is their bid so high? Are you a hoarder? Will they spend two weeks moving stuff out of the rooms and hallway? Are they painting a replica of the Sistine Chapel on your ceiling? If no, get more estimates, NOW."
"Didn't use the shop vac but went and got a new compressor (old one died last year and I've been lazy!) and blew out the return hose that went from the sink backwards and out popped a little something that looked like a rock.  It drains again.Thanks everyone for the replies!"
Do the moisture test....I would come off the wall an inch using a pressure treated 2x4 for the bottom plate and stud out the rest with traditional 2x4 and use R13 roll insulation. This will allow you to still leverage that drain tile and allow the concrete blocks to breathe. 
"Do what I'm concerned about...seems tricky to channel the water back into the shower pan. If that doesn't work then water, not vapor, will push it's way somewhere vs water vapor escaping through the walls.This may be a completely crazy thought though... I am only guessing..."
"Do your remotes have dipswitches?My wife bought two fans with remotes (not Hunter) and they dont have dipswitches but I have to press some reset button or two different buttons to code a remote to the fan. I made sure the other fan was off in order to avoid this very issue."
"Drywall is cheap at about 30 cents a square foot.  And likely all you need is to make a hole large enough to stick your hand and arm into the space.  There are patch kits for under $10 that'll do a great job of covering it back up.You need to play that kid's game:  Go Fish."

"I cannot help you with cleaning, but there is a good website that has lots of great information about noise control.  It is called soundproofing.org, and they got ways to help with apartment sound control.  You might want to look through it and see if anything appeals to you."
"I don't have an answer to your question, but I was curious about how you insulated it.  My garage is barebones.  It is attached to the home, but the remaining 3 walls simply have studs, not even drywall.  I am wondering if there is an economical way of insulating this garage."
"I donü__t know about the drain line being vented, but by now, Iü__d think all the traps have water in them. The smell isnü__t consistent, just when weü__ve run a few appliances. We havenü__t tried the dishwasher yet, but Iü__m guessing thatü__ll kick up the funky smell also. "
"I know full well the difference between corrugated and standing seam. Would take either over shingles. Shingles donü__t shed snow and the wind blows them off far easier than any metal roof. Metal also lasts longer than shingles in every situation Iü__ve ever encountered. "
I saw in the comments you are a software engineer. I also work in the IT field but enjoy dabbling in DIY and home repair. What was the first big project that made you purchase some of your larger items that really take you from handyman/DIYer to full on home improver/remodel?

"I'd stick the register to the t-bar using double sided foam tape. Other things can be made to not rattle by damping them with tape, silicone, any sort of padding jammed in there.Basically, you can't make the ceiling not move, but you can make it not make noise while moving."
"I've used Olive oil on door hinges for 10 years and it's never failed after an application.. WD40 is just fish oil.. how's that any better... Oils are oils is the point I'm trying to say, as much as certain advertising companies want you to believe, for certain applications.."
"If thatü__s the drywall tape, just slide a putty knife in there and pry down and put some joint compound in there and smooth over with a broad knife to squeeze out extra, let dry, apply 2 nd coat, dry, then lightly texture and paint. If itü__s paint, scrape it, patch, paint. "
"If the drywall is standard 1/2"", and the furring is 1"", then a standard 2x4 on its face, bolted to the wall, is going to be more or less flush with the wall. Then you're golden. You only need to cut two smaller holes for the 2x4s, rather than one big hole for the whole mount."
It will stop/start. Sometimes the pump will work fine and discharge into the drain line on the disposal unit like it should but the dishwasher itself will stop with 1 second to go on the cycle. So we open and close it or have to press The ü__drainü__ switch for it to finish. 
"It's a subcontractor and I am fairly certain the cheapest one at that. The original Company is going to come by.Can in expect a door and frame to be free of scratches?I luckily canceled the check for the remaining 2/3rd of the payment so I am holding the cards right now. "
It's not that uncommon for tile roofs. As a kid we'd pressure wash our tile roof every 2 years and repaint it with a latex paint as part of our summer chores. Kept it completely leak-free. But ours was pretty well-maintained and didn't have pre-existing leaks/extensive moss.

"Many of the old houses basically had plain 1 x 6 (6inches, not the standard measurement). It depended on time, style, etc. My 1919 farmhouse is very plain. Others are much more ornate. Go with the overall style of the house. You could also do some research if you care enough."
"Mice can be very vicious, and by vicious I mean destructive. Last month my neighbors new (6mth old) car wouldn't start. After the dealer couldn't figure it out I sent him to my preferred shop and they found a single mouse had made a nest in his car out of his wiring harness. "
"Never solder copper in an area that's not easily accessible...Never use crimp fittings in an area that's not easily accessible...What's with the push-fit paranoia? They are rated for inaccessible locations. There's no evidence they last any shorter than any other fitting."
"No 14 AWG laying around unfortunately. The instructions were minimal and did not specify - not shocking when buying cheap online. These panels are replacing basic sockets that had bulbs screwed into them, so the 12/2 Romex was existing - I did not install it for this project."
"Not a professional opinion, but anecdotal evidence, my grandparents and aunts all had hardwood floors and *large* active dogs (great danes, boxers, and golden retrievers). They always said as long as they had slip proof rugs in high traffic areas, their floors stayed intact. "
"OH! Good idea. Yeah, a big nice-looking fan cover could be built from the perforated metal sheets hardware stores carry as radiator covers. Painted, itü__d fade away more than the current fan cover and you could center the light in it. Add this to my other list of ideas, OP. "
"Probably not that big of a deal. We had about 5 ""tabs"" fly off in a bad storm this spring. I had a company do a full inspection and replace the five shingles but they said it probably would have been fine without the work. I think I paid $150. I feel better knowing it's done."
"Take care, not all tile guys are top quality. The grout around the edges is a cheap, quick and easy fix (comparatively speaking..). The [likely timber] hob may well not be. You're welcome, best of luck and here's hoping you get someone that'll do it the right way this time!"
"Thank you! They were the first thing I did when I moved in and I really like them, but the nice thing is theyü__re returnable if you decide you donü__t like them.You know itü__s funny, itü__s not until you become a homeowner that you start to appreciate things like blinds. "
"Thanks. I had already sent a message to Mayne. Their user manual specifically says that the piece is only available with the post, so I don't have my hopes up.I've never thought of the local woodworker... Is there a good resource for that? Angie's/Craig's Lists, or others? "
"They are expensive but I like the versa lok caps for our climate, unilok has had issues with our winters. I honestly don't know of any around cheap, I only have 1 or 2 in my yard. I am on the West Side on Beck I have a small company that does masonry and concrete restoration."
"Thx!If I shared the numbers about actual temps in the apartment, everyone would say GTFOH but itü__s really my wife...she gets super upset the moment the outside weather goes below 70. So this is more of an escape from that rather then actual need for heat.Thx for the tips!"
We did this too and went cheap. Do not go cheap on the pad. You can go cheaper on the carpet but the pad you will notice the soonest.  Also make sure you or they screw down your subfloor to eliminate squeaks. Put it in writing that they will do this. We learned many lessons. 
"We had a similar problem.  Called an electrician and he couldnü__t find anything wrong at the breaker box.  Called the electric company, they sent someone at no cost and found that the main connection to the unit (along with several other units) was loose.  No problems since."
"We split our retrofitted forced air HVAC system. Furnace is in basement and second story wasn't properly heated or cooled. Added another unit in the attic for the second story. Whole house is 2300 sqft, in midwest, cost about $7k. I expect the DC area would be more expensive."
"Well, i guess if the inside valve is leaking that is possible...not sure how long it would take to fill that section back up.  Might leave outside valve open a little just in case.  Otherwise it will freeze.  If you are handy at all replacing the inside valve shouldnt be hard"
"Whatever you do, put all the lights in appropriate dimmer switches. My electrician thought I was dumb for insisting but MY GOD how nice it is to use the bathroom first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night and not be blasted instantly awake. Dimmers. Seriously."
"When we remodeled our kitchen I saw something like this. I was painting a wall that had previously painted wallpaper. Do you have wallpaper underneath? The moisture from the mud can be lifting it. If that's it you have to sand it down till the ruffle is gone, mud it and sand."
"You have what was originally built as a 3-story single family house, and you are now using it as rental income property for three separate families. You need to invest a little to upgrade the mechanical, and probably other parts. But you probably already know that. Good luck"

a leaky shower pan that you have most likely needs to be redone from scratch and that will not be done for $1300.  Might make  sense to demo out all the old mortar base and walls and start with a pre-form fiberglass pan and correct wall prep for tile or laminate shower panels
"air seal and insulate your attic to R-40 or better first. Wall insulation is fairly low on the ""bang for the buck"" scale particularly if your walls are leaky/windy.Dense pack  is the gold standard because the wind/leaks are diminished but it is difficult to do as a retrofit"
"if I were to put in a drainage pipe that is 'L' shaped, so that one end runs parallel to the bottom of the wall and then turns upwards vertically (essentially to drain the water out to the street from above the wall), would water actually be able to travel up a vertical pipe?"
"&gt;If I wanted to do nail down HW what would the prep be like?It'd be uplifting the tile. Because to fasten through *past* the tile is going to take just as much time and effort in all likelihood.As far as floating floors go, u/vonroyale has some excellent advice, and u/rahchachany has solid advice on not skipping prepwork.I'd recommend smoothing out over the tile. Use a primer designed for non-porous substrates. Then use a feather finish compound to fill the grout lines and smooth out any areas where a tile sits proud."
"I can't speak to this model. But wood burning fireplaces with gas have always been a thing. It's for starting, so you don't have to cram newspaper in there, which gives off really light ash that doesn't always make it up the chimney and instead floats into the living room. It's also just a pain sometimes.I grew up in a 1950s house with a normal fireplace, with a gas port in the back. You put the wood in as normal, turn on the gas, light it with a long fireplace match, and let it burn for 5-10 minutes, then shut it off. Easy."
"I didnü__t too a ton of research on the floor, so Iü__m sure thereü__s way better options for it, just watched a bunch of YouTube videos for ideas. I just picked up a few epoxy cans from Home Depot and rolled them on. Maybe spent $100. I did do A LOT of scrubbing of the floor before hand with degreaser and acid to prep the surface.  Also used primer so Iü__ll be happy if it lasts me a few years, I wonü__t ever drive my car over it so hopefully that helps. I have used my power washer on the floor and itü__s been fine so far. "
"I have been browsing Sears Outlet online but I'm worried that the appliances don't have any warranty any longer. Any ideas on that or anything I should be aware of? For example I wanted to buy a discounted floor model oven range at Home Depot. They said that it would not have the manufacturer 1yr warranty any longer and that they only have 30 (or 90, can't remember) day return policy. Thankfully in that case they had a similar new model that they discounted to almost the same price, $20 increase cost after tax and fees. "
"I just built set of steps .60"" wide, 11 treads up. Used four 2x12 stringers, 2x10 treads, 1x6 kick boards, 4x4 newell posts, 2x4 and 2x6 railing, all pressure treated. Wrapped the stringers with blue skin I had left over. Bought some misc hardware. Cost me about  $1000 material only up here in canada. I never priced out the lumber before I built it, I just went and bought it. There's cheaper methods and materials to use.I'm very happy with the end product. Full 7""x11"" ratio so they are great for older people and kids. "
"I think it's important to note here that the cement board is not a waterproofing system.You should be using something like Schluter Kerdi or CBP RedGuard for that. As long as your waterproofing system is continuous from your floor up on your wall at least 6-12 inches, you should have no water problems.Generally, you would build your wall, cover it in cement board, and put the waterproofing system on top of that.From what you're saying, though, you've got some other issues to address with the ""gaps"" on the existing walls."
"I'd be wary of buying from someone who's never *been* in their attic. Where they think cutting a hole in a closet involves several trade professionals and a lot of money is completely beyond me. You're talking like thirty bucks for a piece of plywood, 2x6, and trim to add an attic access. Don't even need a legit contractor for it - any handyman can do it. Hell, any *person* who's ever operated any tool more complex than a butter knife can do it. It doesn't even require a single power tool: keyhole saw, miter box, and a hammer."
"If you have very hard water it will likely leave marks, and you may have to adjust how frequently you clean, but in my experience with fairly hard water in our house there's no water staining.  We have a shower handle/wand that I use to rinse down all the walls after I'm done right before I get out of the shower.  Once a week we use scrubbing bubbles, and maybe once every 2-3 months we'll actually scrub the walls and doors.  Been doing this for ~4 years now and the shower and tub still shine up pretty good when we're done.  "
"It will be fine, BUT......why not use 12/2 to keep everything consistent on that circuit?Also, the fact that there is 12/2 coming out of the panel may cause some confusion and lead someone to believe they can place a 20A breaker on that circuit. I guess if there was already some 14g wiring on that circuit then it doesnü__t matter. But if it is all 12g then I would use 12/2. It will probably make little or not practical difference which one you use, and as long as a 15A breaker remains on that circuit then itü__s fine. "
"It's probably an issue with the shower mixer.  A lot of them have debris screens to keep stuff out of the cartridge, maybe the hot side screen is clogged.  Or the cartridge is bad.  You'll have to pull the trim, see if there are stops in there or you have to shut off the water someplace else.  See if there are access for debris screens. Finally, pull the cartridge, make sure there's nothing in it.  All else fails, new cartridge.Tells us make and model of the shower valve (or post photos) and maybe we can make better guesses."
"Ok but make sure itü__s not the connection between the chrome pipe and the copper threaded connector , it can piss out and run down the back wall where you canü__t see it , hit the floor and run across as the floor is pitched that way . Once you clear that then itü__s time to do the bucket test as described Iü__ve been chasing nonsense like this for 35 years , Iü__ve built over A hundred walk-in and handicap accessible showers . Body sprays are sideways water and you have to be very vigilant when building this type of shower "
"Then you have to minus that cost from the cost of the solar tiles.   So your payback period will be lower.   The Tesla solar roof comes with a lifetime warranty also.  So it should be the last roof you will even need to put on your house.   So if the metal roof is 20k and the Tesls solar roof is 60k your solar cost is now 40k.    Then you have any local incentives for solar.   So say you get 5k back in incentives.   Now your cost is 35,000.   If it erases your $3500 power bill then the roof will pay for itself in 10 years.    "
"There should be a valve thatü__s normally closed so the dishwasher doesnü__t lose all its water during a hot wash cycle....  the steam alone during such a cycle could force all the water out without the valve.   You might see small amounts of water draining if the water pump has enough power to force some water past the valve or if the valve is only opening part way.Iü__d check the solenoid that controls the valve, make sure the connections are tight and try to manually actuate the valve if possible to check for blockages.  "
"To be fair- if you are demoing an existing building and erecting a new one, they have allowances because you donü__t know what crap pops up demoing an existing space.Itü__s pretty common for labor to be 40-60% of material cost. They should be able to provide a basic breakdown, some of it should be negotiable, however for a tear down and rebuild, 75k isnü__t too far off.

"To meet code, it needs to be minimum 6 mil, but Iü__d go with minimum 10 mil.  Overlap seams by 12ü_ù and tape with a thick high quality tape.

"You could look into a reverse osmosis system for the whole house or under the sink. If you just want to avoid taste and eggy smelling shower water you could get a shower filter and a better gravity water filter than the brita you are using.

"You need to look outside and trace the waterflow. It's likely you will find either:a) lack of gutters, overhang, or proper downspoutsb) ground outside that slopes towards the house.c) Ground outside that is too permeable Fix (a) by installing the right equipment, fix (b) by re-grading. Fix (c) by either adding a few feet of sloped hardscaping, or excavate down around the outside of the house, add a dimple mat the foundation, and create a path to a French drain system ($$)Edit regarding re-grading.

"I dig down to footer base about 2' wider than the window for easy working. When I get the opening cut, I pay to have an extra ""+"" cut into the concrete to be removed. This is simply pushed into the bottom of the hole, good for fill and drainage. Then I fill the pit up to about 16"" below the window with 3-4"" chipped rock. Big rocks= cheap and massive drainage. From there up to within 6"" of the bottom of the window they get 3/4"" chipped rock. This can be lessened if you want some pretty rocks like pea gravel for the top couple of inches. All this means massive drainage, and you could literally run a garden hose into this in most soil types and never even start to saturate the area enough to leak into the window. Good luck. Tips from a person who installs these on a regular basis."
"It gets my attention in this particular neighborhood we've looked at because the HOA architectural guidelines require metal or cedar shake.  The homes are 20-25 year old, so the original cedar shakes are starting to get to the end of the road, and it isn't exactly cheap to replace those either.  This place has what appears to be a fairly new metal roof, so there is value there in my eyes.  Having replaced my current asphalt roof a couple years ago, just getting the quotes and having the work done is a pain the ass I'd like to avoid.  Now, it does lack some other things I'd want that also cost money and require vetting of contractors (finished basement being one big one), so its not a slam dunk.  But I wanted to make sure I wasn't overselling the value of this roof in my head."
"It's not hard, just a pain in the ass. Here's what I did:took down all the doorsremoved all the hardwarefilled all the holessanded old paint to rough it up / smooth out the puttyrepainted doors and cablinets both sides. 2-3 coats each.then redrilled for new hinges. I reused the holes for the knobs. repaired all the drawer tracks, drilled for new handles, all same style, couple different sizes depending on drawer size. redrilled and reattached all doors.It took me about a week of evenings, couple late weekends. Totally worth it. Our kitchen isn't large. Maybe ~120 bucks for hardware, paint and supplies. One thing I learned, latex even when dry, is fairly fragile for a while. had a couple chips in the first few days. It's pretty tough now a few months later. "
"I'll just throw in my thoughts:&amp;#x200B;This is really location dependent. While I do think this is overpriced for just about anywhere, it's probably WAY more overpriced in place like Iowa than in a major urban area like NYC, Boston, Seattle, or SF. There are really two major items that drive this estimate's cost and are overpriced:\- Building materials - $15k\- Concrete - $17k&amp;#x200B;Building materials should probably be more in the $7-8k range and concrete should probably be in the $4-5k range (depending on the concrete).&amp;#x200B;The other big thing is that this GC is double dipping. All of these prices are fairly reasonable if you assume he's already applied a 15% markup. &amp;#x200B;If you reduce the building materials and concrete as I mentioned and cut the ""builder's fee"", you subtract \~$30k from this estimate and it becomes $45k. That would be a pretty decent price in a major metro area, but after reading these comments, it sounds like something in Iowa should be way cheaper. Best of luck."
"No, dont. A lot of HVAC people don't recommend cleaning ducts unless they're really really old. In most cases it does more harm than good. Whatever gets in your ducts and settles there, it won't move. When the cleaners come, they'll remove plenty but they will also just move a bunch of crap that the system will be able to cough out now since it's been jostled out of place. End result, you'll have worse air quality for a short time after the cleaning and only marginal improvement afterwords. Also, if you've got flex ducts, never ever clean your ducts. It's just going to break your ducts and cause more air leakage. Maybe there is someone around you who could do an air quality test or survey. They may be able to point you in the direction. You can also consult a doctor to try and pinpoint the issue. You can just start developing allergies. It's possible you've lived around the allergen for a long time and are just now being allergic. I was allergic to grass for one summer. Haven't been allergic ones. Allergies are complicated. "
"Belt sander if you want to do it quick, but it as another poster has mentioned they *are* very aggressive even at less aggressive grit numbers. You may still want a rotary sander/polisher even after going over with a belt. You'll also want an edger.. for the edges..By the looks of that floor, you may want to gauge how deep the worst of the scratches are and compare that against how much is left on the top part of the groove for the tongue and groove locking system before you end up having the grooves split from being too far worn down. I'm thinking you may even want to *begin* with something as aggressive as a 20 grit - but first practice a bit with a higher number grit (e.g 80ish) on the machine so you don't end up doing irreparable damage.Make sure if the paper is directional (on the back side) that it runs the right way. Empty out the catcher semi-regularly. Always empty it out at night and leave your rubbish bags of dust a very safe distance from the house. Only stain if you're exceptionally confident in how smooth your floor is (hint: it's still not smooth enough, and it still won't be). Take it up to at least 120 grit before finishing, and before finishing use a shopvac (take your time) over the entire floor thoroughly. Twice, even.Honest opinion? Good luck, godspeed."
"In terms of curb appeal you could hide a lot with a nice fence or wall. If you donü__t feel like dropping that kind of coin you could try landscaping or paint. Try photoshopping different colors on the brick and hardie. See which looks better. If I had more time on my hands I would help with a quick sketch up render. Maybe if I have time next weekend.The front facade looks pretty bland and Iü__d agree that the lower entry isnü__t the most appealing. If I had the money Iü__d consider details on the columns, landscaping, maybe lighting sconces, modern style fence with a gate. Possibly painting the brick but Iü__d definitely try to see how it might look in a 3d model first.  Roof skirt might help to break up the space between the entry and upper balcony.Based on the grade at the sidewalk compared to the entry, you may want to consider a lower wall even though your first instinct is to hide as much as possible. A 6ü__ wall/fence might seem imposing with that big blank front feature and the lower finish grade. A pony wall could be an option with a fence on top but Iü__d look around. Maybe brick to match the home?  Id like to see more photos, angles, neighborhood, plans if you have any. Doesnü__t have to be too much information if you arenü__t comfortable with it but it would help!"

It has stood the test of time. I don't know if it's the pattern or the fact that it's light colored but I never noticed any scratches in the floor. Also my parent's live off a bay and haven't had problems with the floor when it's humidity. However, they have just recently started having a small warping issue when their yorkie got old and started urinating in the same spot constantly for 2 years. But it's like barely noticable, which still impresses me. The floor they had before that was the cheap laminate that bubbled up after any spill no matter the size. So I'd say that this bamboo is 100 times better than laminate but not quite as good as a normal wood floor because it's not easily sanded down and refinished."
"&gt; I only remember being constantly freezing in this house Usually the fix for that isn't to change how you get heat **into** the house, but to add insulation to prevent the heat from **leaving** the house.If your electrical system is modern, you can always put a little resistive electric heater in often used parts of the house to add a little heat -- all resistive electric heat is equally efficient, and equally expensive to operate, but at least you'll be warm.&gt; For those suggesting pellet, how easy is it to get it set up in a new space as opposed to replacing current wood stove? I think I would prefer it in the center of the house in the living room.Many pellet stoves can used a simplified through-wall or through-roof venting system and don't require a full masonry chimney.   You'd want an expert to help determine the complexity of your particular install.   Similarly, many modern propane heating appliances are available as ""direct vent"", this means they can be vented out through a wall or roof without needing a full chimney.  And propane is only slightly more expensive than oil and unlike pellet stoves, propane ""wall furnaces"" can be set to run automatically without requiring semi-daily cleaning and reloading.&gt; I was hoping in a magic world it was just as easy as switching the oil source to electric, hooking it up through same system! There are sometimes options to ""simply"" replace the current oil burner with a huge ""electric furnace"", but that'd still bring with it a doubling of your annual heating costs :)"
"It has been my experience that almost all the times that a roof has failed, it is due to a faulty installation and NOT the fault of the product.All those big companies make millions of tiles a year.  They have the manufacturing process down pat.  The chances of getting a bad batch are almost microscopically small.  The chances of screwing up the installation is pretty much 50/50, though.  You've really got to do your homework on choosing which company to go with, IMHO.It is unfortunate, but in the roofing industry, there are a lot of unqualified people out there claiming to be professionals.  There are manufacturer's programs to address this, but not every company is willing to meet the standards.  GAF, as an example,  has their Master Elite Roofing Contractor certification. It is a good program, but it's costly to the contractor, and requires a commitment to a training schedule.  As a result, only something like 3% to 4% of the US roofers are actually certified.I am not saying an uncertified roofer will screw up your new installation.  There are companies in my area that have been doing this for over 75 years.  I have them in my contact list.  They have done work for me in the past, and stand behind their installations. But in your area you may not have that luxury.  I would suggest that if you do not have, or do not want to pay for a certified company, that you go with longevity.  A local roofing company with a verifiable track record goes a long ways towards insuring that you get a roof that will not fail for decades."
"No, sadly she won't let me touch the new house. Like nothing, not a single thing. And the historical society nazis are out of control. The barn and one other outbuilding is done (vintage 1820's) but still trying to push the house plans and other building restorations through. Old house that was on property (was vandalized and burnt down) was like 12k square feet. That's stupid big. We don't want to raise kids in something like that. We don't ever want them to think something like that is normal... We want something much smaller --in the 4000-4500sf range. Because we don't want to rebuild what was there last, now the historical nazis are saying our only other choice is something that resembles the ORIGINAL house (ugly) that was built back before dirt was invented. It's been a royal pain in the balls. Also, we have the wonderful luck of picking old properties with cemeteries on them. Took us like 5 months just to confirm that the cemetery was actually decommissioned (like the f'ing town records said) and that there were no bodies buried in the back yard. So dumb. F'n lawyers are going to be able to build something bigger/better by the time we are done. Oh and we are height limited to X feet above grade (so you don't build some monstrosity and cock-block the neighbor's view) which has also been a pain. She wants a traditional home (pointy roof, etc.) and I'd do a reverse floorplan with a GIANT roofdeck, flat roof, etc for the views. Fighting with a knocked up wife is... well... good luck... they can be batshit crazy sometimes. :) "

"Absolutely break it up  Even if you using tile throughout, using some different tile will break it up enough. Personal oponion, I hate tile in bedrooms. I also dislike laminate flooring. I have seen some really nice cork, it is interesting. Good luck hope it turns out great."
"All you can do is watch it.  Cracks in foundation are normal as the house continues to settle.  If it gets bigger or you notice cracks in your drywall upstairs along the same line or doors swinging in ways they didnü__t swing before, you should talk to a foundation specialist."
"Also check the faucets' aerators.  I just bought a house that had the same issue. Turned out the lines had a bunch of gunk in them and when I turned them on it pushed all that gunk into the aerator causing it to trickle.Taking them off and cleaning them may fix the problem. "
"Alternately if you have a long screwdriver you might be able to turn the thumb screw in the center of the light behind the bulb in that picture, to remove it from the ceiling, instead of breaking the glass.  That might have added benefit of allowing you to further investigate."
"As long as you donü__t spray it freely everywhere, just small light burst over the hinges,I found  little tissue under it to absorb all drips stops contamination of any sort, and the ü__strawü_ù is pretty essential to stopping it spray in a larger area...precision is key :)"
"As others have said, yes. Those are 1/4 turn ball valves. As the name implies, 1/4 turn (90 degrees) will shut the valve. The direction the handle is going indicates the water flow.  (Handle in-line with the pipes = water flowing. Handle is perpendicular = water not flowing). "
"As per their label this is strictly for finished wood.  Unless the doors have a full unbroken coat of sealer this is not the product to use.If the doors are bare then a proper deep clean and finishing will keep them looking good for a long time at the cost of some labor now."
Depends on when they last ran.  But yes there is likely water puddled in the bottom.  When you go to take them out if you can tilt the unit ~45 degrees towards the outside before removal and it should let most of the water run out.  You will still have some though most likely.
"EcoSmart are cheap because the electrics built into the base of each bulb cost only pennies.  In this case you get exactly what you pay for.  Go with a name brand bulb.  They cost more, but will do what you want.  I personally use Sylvania, but there are many to choose from."
"First of I'd try to locate the part. If not or too costly, I would honestly buy a door seal at a home depot and epoxy it in place. Probably won't be as efficient as if new, but cost benefit you'll probably save money on a little extra cooling cost with the $10 worth of parts. "
"Getting quotes canü__t hurt. Itü__ll give you an idea about whether you want to do it yourself.Itü__s not an insurmountable task. You could D.I.Y.Personally, I hate drywalling. Iü__d do everything up to the drywall repair, then have a pro do that, and do my own repainting."
"Heh, I would not give one momentü__s thought to online reviews for a 4x4.Anyway, definitely check out a local building supply shop / lumber yard. The quality should be as good or better than HD, their prices are often better, and most will offer free or cheap local delivery."
"I did a similar project in my last home.  I donü__t remember how many bags I blew in, but I remember it wasnü__t fun and it took a LONG time.  The box box store blowers work, but they are low volume compared to what a contractor would use.   I likened it to watering a lake. "
"I don't know where you are but $250 a square is a median price. That's for tearoff of one layer and archys. You need to contact a couple of local roofers. There are variables that affect price like ease of access, height of roof, hips and valleys, dormers, chimneys and locale."

"I wouldn't try that. Ozone is very toxic though it does dissipate fairly quickly after the machine is turned off (in about 30 to 45 minutes).  I am not sure simply shutting the door to a room while filling it with toxic gasses while you are in the same house is a smart idea."
I'd get the foundation looked at by a few people they're all going to tell you it needs to be fixed hoping to get a job but it might help you find out how if its serious or not by how high the bids are. Throw some spackle or joint compound in the cracks and slap on some paint!

"If you dont mind me asking, where are you located? PVC isn't allowed for potable water in my state, and i thought it wasn't allowed anywhere. Surprised to see it made of pvc, and buried so shallow. Had to replace my water line a year ago due to a leak, it was buried 5 ft down."
"Is it GFCI protected? If yes, it's all good. If no, don't be a fucking moron. My guess is if it's an ungrounded outlet it's not protected, but check either way. You would then need to install a GFCI. It should be weather resistant, tamper resistant, and with an in use cover."
"It doesn't need to stay completely dry, just not soaking wet. The roof keeps the majority of the water off of the top layer of wood, and the top layer keeps it off the rest. Most firewood is either air dried in large stacks similar to this, without even a roof, or kiln dried. "
"It's possible to get just one property line surveyed. This could save you money. If the original subdivision and amendment were done legally, then it is documented in his deed. (If it effected the property line between your lot and his, then your deed will also reflect it). "
"Leave the TV where it is and run an extension cord from an outlet to the TV from another circuit and see if it still happens. Also try the Wii on another circuit from the fan. Also, you may have hung a picture on a wall or placed a table somewhere that lets a signal bounce. "
"Maybe a bit, but not really any considerable amount. Everything in the house is different, he had wood on one door and metal on another. I'm thinking I might have to use something like a corner trim just to cover it up, and avoid inviting anyone that will insist on tripping. "
"Might want to just abandon it and put a new hole to outside near the dryer. Iü__m not sure about the construction of the wall behind it, but if itü__s just wood, etc. itü__s pretty easy to cut through. Thinking of doing this on ours since the dryer vent goes behind a cabinet. "
Not very pretty solution would be some kind of barrier that would keep her away from the spindles. Cheap would be zip ties and cardboard (high enough that she canü__t grab them) more expensive/prettier would be some kind of clear plastic sheeting following the same principle  
"Pictures would help diagnose this.I painted houses in the summer growing up and can confirm that itü__s not difficult but it is labor intensive.  Having the right gear and knowing the proper techniques make a world of difference, and are probably worth investing in/learning."
Some strong 2 sided tape and mirror acrylic sheeting would be my route.  Mirror acrylic is fairly light which will make it easier to attach with 2 sided tape and will not overload the hinges.  Most plastic suppliers will carry the mirror acrylic and be able to cut it for you. 
"Stupid question, but are the bits you are using meant for an impact driver and not just a regular drill/driver?  An impact driver bits are made of a stronger steel to endure the impact force as well as the rotational forces.  I ruined quite a few bits before I discovered this."
"Take the aerator off the kitchen sink and see if it will flow.  If not, leave the aerator off with the tap open, and find your cold water shutoff valve.  Turn it on and off a few times to see if you can use the water pressure to help push whatever is clogging the ling out.  "
"Thanks! It sure feels great to finally work on a big piece of the home. The fireplace is a big focal point since it is in the family room where the kitchen opens up to, so it's a big gathering area where people spend most of their time. I'm so glad the project turned out well."
Thanks.  I was confused what could be the cause because I was watching various YouTube videos where some people said you needed to move the strike plate while others said to insert a shim under one of the hinges.  So I had no idea how to go about fixing my particular problem. 
"That depends on where you are.  Some plumbing codes are happy with 1 1/2 shower drains, which is perfectly reasonable, since 1 1/2 pvc will flow over 5 gpm  (vs maybe 2 or 3 from the shower head) with 1% slope, and the higher flow rates provides better scouring of the pipes.  "
"That is an amazing ivy growth. It's like a strangler fig. Never seen anything like it outside of Angkor Wat. This is not a job for an amateur, unless you are just cutting the whole mess down - possible if you have the skills and tools. So curious what the arborist will say. "
"The UBC hasn't been around since the 90's and, oddly enough, the words ""license"" or ""electrician"" are nowhere in the 2018 IRC.And aside from that, the IRC carries *zero* legal weight in and of itself. The ICC simply provides codes for AHJs to adopt and alter as they see fit."
The one brand I was really impressed by was from a local bamboo flooring specialist in Honolulu. Iü__ve installed all the Home Depot bamboo flooring and itü__s all garbage. I would say just look for a reputable flooring supplier and donü__t spend less than $2.50/ square foot.

They are heavy as fuck.  Friend of mine was getting rid of his and called me to help him carry it to a trailer.  Got there and there were like 10 other guys he'd invited as well.  Between a dozen or so of us we barely got the damn thing moved.  That mofo was extremely heavy.  
"This may be the easiest route then. $60 GFCI breaker. I can work a few extra hours for simplicity. This is the most difficult part remodeling the basement so far. Adding and rewiring everything else was a breeze until I hit this old 2-wire cable.Thanks a bunch for your time!"

You also need to watch for them having their subs doctor their invoices so that they line up with what you have pictured so basically the gutters cost 500 and he has sub write it at 750 making 250 plus that 15%.  Negotiate the line items with the one you had the best repor with and then negotiate that 15 to 10 percent. 
"I have experience with tankless water heaters, the pro is that you never run out of hot water (given sizing is right). The con is that unless you add a recirculation pump you have to wait - 9 seconds to get hot water given a standard branch riser set up. If you have a manifold system this helps, if you have a recirculation pump, this helps more. If you have none of these things and are trying to retrofit into an old house, your costs will be astronomical compared to a standard $500 water heater. You probably won't see a return."
"I like an angle grinder with a masonry blade, myself.  It is less abusive to the surrounding stone.  I plug it into an AFGI-GFCI protected circuit, then trickle a little water on the places I need to grind.  Cuts way down on the dust that gets produced.Safety first.  You need to wear a real respirator (not a dust mask), gloves, and eye protection.  Stone dust is no joke.  It'll cut the shit out of your lungs if you get enough of it.  Cough up blood one time and you'll remember for all eternity.Ask me how I know this........"
"I use an indoor/outdoor rug in my garage and another outside on my patio under a few of my sonü__s toys. They were bought at Costco, they look [nice](https://imgur.com/a/JHWAKOV)  ,sorry I only have a picture of my backyard, and are super easy to keep clean. If it gets wet it just dries up quickly and they donü__t have a backing or  pad to get smelly.  I use my shop vac to vacuum them clean of leaves and dirt. Once a year I take them out and hit them to knock all the dust and sand out and air out then back out they go again. "
"Just polish and seal the concrete, then put giant area rugs or carpet remnants down.It will help water seal your floor, you can always easily inspect it, and the vinyl plank will need a level floor or an underlaymentWe put floating wood (no adhesive at all) over concrete slab in living room. Used a 3-in-1 underlayment that was 2 vapor barriers with foam in the middle. Worked well to smooth out the floor. You could do this and forget any adhesive.You can dry lay all the planks out and walk on it and see how bad it creaks."
"My wife did the exact same thing, not 2 weeks after we moved in (brand new oven) to the house...because she wanted to catch cheese dripping off a pizza.We scraped. got some of it. 2 years later it is still scarred...but it is the inside of an oven so it is minor in that no one will ever see it.But don't put tin foil at the bottom of a modern over...it even says specifically not to do that in the manual. the bottom gets hot because the element is close to it...and that melts aluminum. melted metal to metal is not coming off."

"The white stuff is efflorescence. Itü__s moisture getting into the bricks from the outside and pushing slight moisture and minerals through the bricks. This happens most of the time because the waterproofing on the outside of the house is no good. Also the fact that there is seepage tells me you have water issues. Itü__s likely you need an exterior waterproofing done or an interior drainage system with sump pump to help remedy the issues. I think if you finish it without these being fixed, itü__ll be a breeding ground for mold."
"Think about what you want it to be. Do you want it to be an extension of your home? An open, outdoor room of sorts that you can walk onto the same way you walk into the kitchen. You can open the door and walk out to BBQ while overlooking your yard or do you want it to be a part of your yard separate from your home? A standalone deck that allows you to look up at your house and be on the same level as your yard.I can tell you as someone looking for a new home the houses with walk out decks score way higher with my wife and I.

"To fix it you would need to replace the outlets with brand new ones. You would have to choose if you want them controlled by the switch or if you want them on all the time. In either case, it will involve re-wiring and safely and properly capping off the circuit you donü__t want to use. I wouldnü__t recommend doing any electrical work unless you are very skilled with it. Electricity is not something to DIY if you donü__t truly understand how it should be done. An electrician could do this in &lt;20 min, should be pretty cheap. "

"Eh. For appliances, I can't say either way.For laptops and TV's, they worked for me. I bought a Best Buy warranty and was able to turn a base-model Toshiba laptop I bought in 2002 into a new Macbook in 2005.Also, I bought a Samsung 43"" Smart TV from Target in 2015 and got the Asurion warranty. This past November, the motherboard and wireless card were going out, so they had me send it in to get repaired.When I got the TV back, I cracked the screen pulling out of the box. They then sent me an LG 43"" TV as a replacement, but it had a dark spot on the screen so, they took that return back and sent us a 50"" LG 4K TV. It really worked out for us in those two situations. The advance in technology that took place during the warranty period meant that we got superior replacements. "
"Ideally, the toilet flange should be installed after tiling, so that the flange sits on top of the tile.  If it's not, a standard wax ring will not be thick enough to bridge the gap and you'll have leaks, although there are solutions to bridge that gap (thick ring, flange extensions).That said, it sounds like the flange is already installed and that you're not planning to redo any plumbing. So, if I were you, I'd go with option A. There's no point shimming anything before tiling - for the tile job you'll need to have the toilet out of there entirely, and when the tiling is done you'll have to deal with flange extensions or extra-thick rings.I assume this is a concrete floor? If wood, make sure that the floor is strong enough for tile - you may need to beef up the sub floor. "
"Iü__ve used Klean Strip before - itü__s really effective, but you donü__t wanna get it on your skin. It burns. Itü__s pretty effective, but itü__s kinda a jelly like substance so you need to put in on, cover it with plastic and kind smear it down under the plastic.Iü__ve also used some stuff called Bean E Doo (something like that) - itü__s made from soybeans and is specifically for mastic. That stuff is liquid and less caustic, but I still wouldnü__t get any on you. Itü__s super greasy (donü__t slip!) afterwards so you define need to clean with TSP or another strong degreaser afterwards.That said, a pregnant woman probably shouldnü__t be messing with adhesive strippers because of the fumes. If your SO canü__t do this, I would probably just wait or carpet over it.Good luck!"
"Pro here, you have thinner ceramic tile so pulling it won't be as bad as it could have been.    Having said that, and only seeing a very small part of the floor, you never know exactly what you are getting into when you pull up floors until you get into doing it.    We use long crowbars and cut down straight hoes to make short work of tile removal. That area isn't big enough to use a power stripper.

"We absolutely love them. The amount of customization and flexibility they offer is amazing, none of the other manufacturers came close (sorry!). The base cabinet drawers make things so much more accessible than standard base cabinets. They do come flat-packed and I assembled them. That's part of the fun! IKEA flat-pack is like grown-up LEGO.

"I have a Samsung gas range. It's nice - standard range. I cannot speak to convection because my oven doesn't have that function (I think?).Functionality: I do mostly basic cooking and baking, everything seems normal. Baking tends to take a bit longer than what recipes say. The only unusual thing I do is canning, and it does just fine heating the giant canning pot to boiling. I use a corner burner but I bet the center burner would be better - haven't tried it. Oven panel is very easy to use. Knobs slide off for cleaning.Cosmetic: I like the way the glass goes to the edges, the grill ""pattern"" is also nice looking (hate how Frigidaire stoves look). It came with a griddle pan that goes on top of the center burner. I would've preferred a center griddle pan that replaces the grill and I could leave on the stove all the time. But that's only because I don't have any counter space next to my range and I wanted to put my spoon rest on the griddle pan. That baby simmer burner is useless, but I think most gas ranges have a simmer-sized burner.I have one model ""up"" from this one - has silver knobs and came with a flat griddle pan, not whatever they show:https://www.lowes.com/pd/Samsung-5-Burner-5-8-cu-ft-Freestanding-Gas-Range-Stainless-Steel-Common-30-in-Actual-29-9375-in/1000045551"
"Hey I'm late to the game but just want to say I've been there. Keep in mind a few things... Houses will have cracks. It is what it is. Especially in the corners near windows and doors. Doors are good to stick as humidity changes. My doors stick a bit in winter. Hardwood Floors are going to swell a bit in higher humidity. Now also keep in mind that this is your first home and your mind will play tricks on you. I was telling my wife ""omg that crack got so much bigger. Something is wrong with the house. I know it."" I checked our inspection report with photos. Same size as the picture. Didn't expand like I thought it did. New cracks might also pop up. Why? Before people sell a home they cover up the cracks. Typically with some sort of filter. Rarely do they redo the area with a proper patch and sanding. So all those cracks that weren't noticeable open right back up with any movement. I called two structural engineers out. House was fine. I was sure something was seriously wrong. And this house actually had some pins installed (very common in the area) for our south wall and  they both said the work was great no issues. So just breathe a bit. Your house isn't going to collapse. Take a pen and mark where the cracks are. See if they get bigger. And take pictures. Getting longer isn't a big deal. Getting much wider is more cause for concern. Don't stress about hairlines. Call out a structural engineer that does inspections for piece of mind if you want. Find one with a good rep. And relax! Your first year is the worst. It gets better. "
"You forgot the rest of that passage:------**(I) Receptacle Outlets.** *Except as covered in 220.14(J) and (K),* receptacle outlets shall be calculated at not less than 180 volt-amperes for each single or each multiple receptacle on one yoke.

This provision shall not be applicable to the receptacle outlets in 210.11(C)(1) and (C)(2).------Hmm, let's see what 220.14 (J) and (K) say:------**(J) Dwelling Occupancies.** In one-family, two-family, and multi-family dwellings and in guest rooms or guest suites of hotels and motels, the outlets specified in (J)(1), (J)(2), and (J)(3) are included in the general lighting load calculations of 220.12.

"Wasp/hornet spray is a good defense tool to have to rid yourself of flying stinging insects, and even an intruder that needs to be taught a lesson. Pepper spray works, but the blow back can harm you too, wasp spray works at a grater distance, and make sure to aim for the face. "
"What's the price of sod versus planting grass seed? The area is about 50'x10'. What types of stores sell sod? I honestly don't know much about it.I dug up another area so I could level that out, and it was all topsoil. Is it ok to plant grass seed there now or should I wait?"
"Where are you buying them from? You can but lots of cheap good quality led bulbs on Amazon, the reviews will help you decide whatü__s best, never believe hype which is just marketing bs. Heat is the #1 enemy of led bulbs so getting decent bulbs in an enclosed fixture is a must."
"Will probably need to use something like Kilz on the paneling before painting (or the stain will leak thru the paint, guess how I know) and even then it still wonü__t look great. Iü__d replace it with Sheetrock. You can do it yourself, just watch some videos and take your time."
"Yea you want a miter saw for cutting baseboard. Not because the table saw will tear up the MDF, but the miter saw is just the safer more accurate tool for the job. I've cut MDF baseboard on a table saw before and it worked fine but a miter saw would definitely have been easier."
"Yes. Just in case you didnü__t know, normally the water supply valves are below the sink. But sometimes theyü__re missing (was my case in the bathroom). The only option when that happens is to shut the entire house. And while the water is off, get valves and a new cartridge! :)"

"&gt; a reason they didnü__t place another window like utility lines etc.Virtually anything can be moved. Electrical is trivial, plumbing not hard either, and there's unlikely to be any plumbing there anyway, unless that spot is directly above or below a bathroom.&gt;  how would find out if there is something there?Well, the person installing the window will cut out the drywall first, then you can just see what's there. Non-destructively, do you have a basement where you can see if any pipes or wires head in that direction?"
"/u/rhinorulz and I are talking about two different things.  I was referring to Brita style filtered drinking water.  His is what is called a 'rock stopper', in that it captures particulates in the water.  His is good, and you may like the taste of it.  It is not a bad system at all.  In contrast, many R.O. systems use five or six stages, to get the water just right.  Some folks are fairly picky about their drinking water, and that is where R.O. really shines.  But it is slow, and requires a storage tank for the filtered water."
"I agree with the comments regarding figuring out if you have water conditioning issues, i.e. really hard water. This is something that would eventually cause issues with all appliances in the house that heart the water to it makes sense to get a hold on that.Second, see what the power supply requirements are for the unit and make sure that those are properly meet and that there isn't a ton of other stuff on that breaker.Third, check to see that the drain line that you're connecting to doesn't get backed out run very slowly.

"If by ""Northeast"" you mean New Jersey, yes I would seriously consider AC of some kind, especially if you don't want to leave your windows open for some reason (noise, crime). If you live in Maine, that is a very different climate.Also are you talking about window AC units, central air, or something else like a mini split? If you are only in 1 or 2 rooms you may be well served by window units or a mini split (again, depending on your climate).Solar has nothing to do with this whatsoever and is a completely different question."
"Know your rights as a renter: the landlord has to take care of everything, including appliances and especially the building/property. The answer is almost always, ""the tenant is fine, the landlord has to get it taken care of,"" even if the landlord says it's not true. Seriously, though: if you're renting, research renters' rights.And, as others have noted: ALWAYS document everything, even if you get a verbal agreement, it's not enough. Always assume the landlord will try to screw you over, no matter how nice he/she/they is/are."
"Menards rents ladders.  I can rent a 28ft extension ladder in my area (if I didn't already own one).  Look at it this way.  You want to gain access to a particular height on your house to hang something.  Eventually whatever you hang is going to need to be serviced in some way; either repaired or taken down or whatever.  That means you're going to need access again in the future.  You're going to need this size of ladder more than once.  Depending on how often you need to get up there you might be better off buying the ladder."
"Nest requires servers at google to be able to run. In 20 years are they going to support those servers anymore or require you to upgrade to a new product?

"Well, unfortunately there is no easy fix to make this disappear.  As far as I know you canü__t just spot stain and clear a spot and have it perfectly match.  Exactly matching the stain color for a spot fix is next to impossible, and unless you know the type of clear used and the specifics of the application, matching the sheen on a spot finish canü__t happen either.My bet is on stripping and refinishing the whole top for an as new look, but someone over at r/woodworking may be able to point you in an acceptable direction. "
"Yeah whoever said that is spreading hearsay. Sharkbites are 50+ year fittings and perfectly fine for using behind walls and other inaccessible locations. If it doesn't leak when you first test it, it won't. At least that's my experience working with them.You can fuck up soldering a copper joint. You can fuck up a crimp or cinch. Either of those can be broken by something crazy happening like severe stress on the pipe. There is no evidence I've ever seen that any of them are more durable than push-fit connectors like Sharkbite."
"You *should* rehang that door probably. But that doesn't mean you *have to*. In my experience that can often be fixed by messing with (adjusting) the hinges. Are you sure they're all tight?Try driving a 3"" screw into one of the holes on the jamb side of the top hinge (not door side, obviously) sometimes this will straighten out the door when the screw bites into the jack stud. Hope that makes sense.Really though you probably have to rehang it man but I know that's a pain so am guessing you want to try everything else first. "

"I always use oil based paints for cabinetry, because it dries to a rock hard finish.

Don't get me wrong; oil based paints are a bit harder to work with, and require more time for clean up.

"My Chamberlain was opening by itself during the day/at night and I couldn't figure out why. I thought the neighbors had a door with the same frequency.   I eventually broke it because I was stupid enough to lock it and forgot to pull the quick release! Don't do that. Well I had someone at work sell me another Chamberlain and I installed it, same thing started happening. Well my opener button was located on the inside of the house and I have two 80 plus pound dogs, so I started getting suspicious because there were markings around the button. So I undid the button and moved it to the inside of the garage and low and behold the door stopped opening by itself. So I guess the questions are, do you have large dogs and is the button on the inside of the house where they can get it?    "
"Yes the connector itü__s self was warm. I think these things are fine for ground connections and say up to 5A circuits all day. But a 20A circuit no. If your in the middle of wiring try what I did. Run the microwave from the circuit you used these. In fact turn everything on that you used on that circuit so your pulling max current and go touch it after running for a few minutes. This is why I stopped using them. I had to extended a few Rolex wires and I was a little lazy so I used the junction boxes where the smoke alarms were so Iü__d have access later since by code your not suppose to bury connections like this. However there were two cases where I had no choice so I twisted the wires and then soldered them before burying them. Then put a wire nut with heat shrink tubing. "
"If you are interested in safety and keeping all your digits, I think SawStop tablesaws are well worth the extra money, especially if you will be working alone in your shop most of the time. Also, for cordless nailers go for the Senco, I was really skeptical as to whether I really needed to spend that kind of money on a nailer, but now that I have it, I never use my pneumatic.  I love that damn thing... and I certainly donü__t miss dragging an air compressor and cord around.Also, as a long time woodworking teacher at several different schools, I have used many different brands of machines and tools over the years. I would never buy Delta, ever! Or most of Dewalt products. Everybody will have preferences, but I found these brands breaking frequently. Delta is notorious for discontinuing replacement parts. If money is not a big concern I recommend looking into Festool products as well. The tools are excellent and dust extraction canü__t be beat. I recommend starting with a mid-size vacuum and random orbit sander. Life changing:-)"
"Its worth doing it yourself. Im sure you can read a tape measure, use a saw, a screw gun. Its not that hard to tile. Demolition is a good chunk of work.

I left the shower cause it was fiberglass and in good shape. If i had a contractor it would have cost $3000-$5000. Took me about a month and a half because i worked on it only on the weekends "
"The earliest construction project I ever did was help my dad build a shed/workshop in our backyard. It was only about 12x10, but it gave me the chance to try a lot of different skills on a small scale. We trenched and ran wire inside conduit for power, poured a slab foundation with concrete, framed the whole thing including a couple windows and doors with properly sized headers and a hip roof (a bit more advanced than a gable roof), insulated, drywalled, painted, shingled, cedar lap siding, trimmed all the windows and doors on the inside and built some shelving. No one task took more than a weekend and if you wanted to, you could stretch the build out over an extended period since itü__s really a non-essential living space, and that would help make it easier on the pocket book too. If you do your research on each individual task as you get to it, itü__s not really a massive dump of information all at once so itü__s easier to retain. At the end of the process youü__ve got a nice spot to store all the tools you bought along the way!"
"We work with an inspector/consultant who specializes in building envelopes and heat transfer pretty regularly - colder upper Midwest climate. His typical recommendation in older homes would be to run any and all electrical you are ever going to want and then use an expanding foam insulation across everything to stop air leaks. Then do high density cellulose over the top but keep the soffits unobstructed. If you donü__t want to go with spray foam, a layer of heavy vapor barrier taped at the seams over everything - especially the tops of walls and any penetrations. He says it is far better for the attic to be colder and to ventilate well and to prevent warm moist air from the home moving into the attic than worrying about too much ventilation.  This prevents mold in the attic and reduces the chance of ice damming.Our preferring insulation tech says excessive venting and fiberglass insulation is bad because it creates a windchill effect because fiberglass doesnü__t stop air moving through it in the way cellulose does as an aside."

Cheap and big impact to take down the shutters and paint them maybe a deep red to tie in the brickwork. Tear out the shrubs and keep the landscaping simple with some tall and short grasses and flowers where they fit. Replace old outdoor light fixtures for something more modern. 
"Correct.  You can install a main breaker panel and like 5 subpanels no problem.Besides cost, the problem is the sheer amount of wiring!  You better have good attic/basement access and some big joists, because you'll either need open space or space to drill a shit ton of holes."
For ballpark estimates doubling the material cost is a decent way to do it. It might end up being 3x or 1.5x but 2x is a good guess for flooring.  Vinyl is usually easy and fast. Carpet in the middle. For other projects like tile 3x materials cost is probably a better estimate. 
"Good luck.  If your landlord makes it hard to talk to him, remember he's probably doing it on purpose to train you to leave him alone.  Be careful not to overplay your hand, if he's within the terms of your agreement he's probably not going to enthusiastically take care of this."

"Sounds like a standard fluorescent light to me.  The ballast in them heats up the mercury vapor, which is the sounds and flickering you're seeing.  The extent of the ""ping"" and flickering will be due to age, so you likely won't be able to duplicate this with a brand new light.  "
"Thanks for response. [Here is more of the door frame where the storm door will be mounted - which requires 1"".](https://imgur.com/KHTIPMV) Hopefully that provides a little more context.Would I use a wood shim to essentially fill in the valley and then mount through the shim?"
"That connector would work fine.I'll try a better description for what I was saying. If you had a 4x4 sitting on top of the ledger, you would drill from the roof side of the 4x4 vertically so a screw driven from the top would go all the way through the 4x4 and into the ledger. "
Vinyl fences I've seen just feel cheap. Plus the sound of them creaking and squeaking in the wind is annoying along with black lawnmower skid marks along the edges. There's just something I like about a wood fence. You could do treated wood and it'll just age to gray eventually.
"We have a recent Fujitsu heat pump with a 200l tank. I checked the temperature a couple of times in the past days (because I was reconfiguring it to maximize COP), the temperature went down about 1 degree every 4 hours. By default, it heats to 55 ÙõC (and once a week to 60 ÙõC)."
We just had a house built and our gas fireplace was the only gas appliance not working. Found out the gas line needed to be bled(get any air out of the system) before it would function properly. May not be the case with yours but just wanted to give my experience with a new unit
"We've used a simple oscillating space heater overnight for years to warm up our bedroom in the winter, since I'm too cheap to warm the while house to my wife's preferred temp.  So long as this fireplace has a fan or something to push warm air around , it seem like it would work."
"What if you donü__t have an access point to the attic? We donü__t have a chimney, so I guess that meant they didnü__t need to build a firemanü__s door/hatch. Does this mean I need to ü__makeü_ù one? If so, what would you recommend? Picking a closet upstairs and cutting one out? "
"Yep, I ""practiced"" in the hallway and living room on white trim/light gray walls. My cutting skills were pretty spectacular by the time I got to the rooms with dark walls.Also, good painter's tape is expensive, considering it's basically paper and getting thrown in the trash. "
"Yes, I believe that, in theory, the screws which secure the outlet to the box should be enough to ground the outlet to a properly grounded box, but I don't think code allows you to do this anymore. I do believe you are required to use a pigtail now, but I am not an electrician. "

"&gt;Do not drill with any type of masonry bitCarbide masonry bit in non-hammer function is by far the best way I've found to drill through soft tile like this ceramic.You can get the leaf-blade glass and tile bits, too. Those work well.I've used diamond dremel bits on glass tile. They work, of course. But I would rather handle a drill than a dremel.If OP already owns a drill and an appropriate sized masonry bit, he should at least test on a scrap piece of tile. If that does the job then there's no need to go buy anything."
"Congrats and looking good. I'm about to get the final phases of my attic improvement going next week.

As well as installing insulation fabric and blowing any interior facing walls. Doing the insulation aspect myself, gotta wait till the new system is  complete before doing that aspect though. xv20i heat pump and TAM9 hyperion blower, along with all new ducting.

"I just did my deck. it ain't on water though... So the first consideration I would think is getting something that is made for a dock. But anyways.. I didn't go with power washing because unless you're skilled, there is much higher risk of doing damage so the wood than say sanding. You need to be good with the pressure controls and also be smooth with the gun. Power washing is absolutely not a 100% necessary step, you can sand. The sanding will take longer, but is less risky, and personally, you'll end up with a smoother finish. "
"I see loads of hand and power tools, but nothing for working in the yard. if you have trees, big trees, like *all around your yard*, and especially if all those trees are mature oaks, buy a wheel-around leaf blower.  best investment I ever made, in terms of time saved cleaning up the leaves in the fall.  used to take 8 hours of raking in my back yard one day on the weekend, and the other day was for the front yard (ok, I don't have a 5000 sq ft lot - it's almost an acre). that aforementioned leaf blower saved me 6 1/2 hrs a day!"
"Outside your house, along the edge, somewhere closest to the meter on the curb, will be a pipe coming up out of the ground, there will be a valve to throw or turn before it either goes back into the ground or your house. That is your main shut off, after the meter, from the street. If you have landscaping supply there will be a T off and another valve that goes to your lawn watering, pool, etc. This is so you can turn off water to house, but keep lawn watering schedule going while you are on vacation, between renters or whatever."
"The exterior structure is primarily stone and mortar (lime), the roof is wood packed with clay and straw, these parts of the structure are original and date back 220 years or so, this was once a single room home but when my great grandparents bought the house they built the interior walls with plaster and lath, and put stucco over it all. Some of the original thatching is surely caked into the roof but itü__s been done over several times over the years. Somebody is coming out here from Belfast to assess the structure on Monday."
"The funny / sad thing is, I am ""book smart"" in a lot of this stuff. I love watching the home improvement shows on TV (well, I used to before they all started being dumb competition shows), I subscribe to several home improvement / old house magazines, I watch tons of videos on YouTube... but I am mechanically inept in every possible way, you have no idea... every project I attempt to tackle runs off the rails so quickly.I *want* be better and more confident at this stuff... but so far, I've proven to be my own worst enemy!   :("
"The right answers here are that these should always duct to the outside, that the fan can break and get clogged so you keep it where it can be worked on, not in  some crawl space or wall where inaccessible,  and also if you put the fan motor near the outside you may have to do extra waterproofing.You can get quieter ones.  They get louder with age (dusty motors whine), so get a new one.  Also often the glass fixtures will rattle which can be an easy fix - just tighten the screws or put a little masking tape at the rattle-y bit."
"True. Not much more than an eye bolt, a ladder, and a piece or chain. being in Florida, you may want to take it down for the worst storms (and definitely want to mount it to the ground in regular weather) so it doesn't become a whip and knock out all your windows ;)The other problem I forsee, is water coming off that portion of the roof probably has quite a bit of momentum to it. The chains would look well for water with no horizontal velocity, but I would worry that in your case the water would just shoot right past the chain."
"I can repack a valve stem, or decide it can't be done, in about five minutes.  Replacing a valve has never taken less than two hours, and there's always a complication on old steam stuff.  Start easy, work your way up.  The threads of the valve-spud connection are not the joint.  the joint is the machined spherical surface.  By not replacing the spud, you don't have a proper seal.  Pipe dope isn't for making that up.  Spuds are part of the valve assembly, and need to be replaced when the valve body is.  The first thing to try, after the god damn ear breaks off is to remove the reducer the spud is in, if there is one.  If that won't move, take advantage of the spud being brass.  Make two cuts through its threads, at about 11 and 1 o'clock, and then use a chisel to peel it out.  "
"I have Mohen (Banbury) with spot resistant finish.  I was skeptical about ""Spot Resistant"" but ended up impressed with it.  Not spotproof; but they do look better then faucets in the other bathroom given similar care.  I see several manufactures offer that and I think it is something to watch for and purchase if available.  As for Mohen: The sink had a leaky cartridge after a few weeks (new one sent out under warranty - easy to replace).  Shower head/valve has worked fine (two years).  I'd buy another one but would not be 'brand loyal' based on my experience.Most have very good warranties now. Mohen covers parts for leaks for life (I assume for as  long as you own the home).  (But not labor.)  Just remember to register any product at the company website and/or keep receipts."
"I have a 2-story house with a couple of gutter downspouts that are basically impossible to reach safely with a ladder. I ended up putting a ""little big shot"" nozzle on a good quality rubber garden hose and shoving it up from down below (after removing one section of the gutter at the base). It took some patience (and I got very wet), but it cleared downspouts that were fully plugged with a thick mud-like paste of rotted maple seeds. Here's the nozzle -- crazy amount of water pressure in a tiny package.www.homedepot.com/p/Little-Big-Shot-Super-Nozzle-LBSR-1/202514529This method won't work with a garden house that is expandable or overly flexible. You wouldn't be able to push it all the way up to the downspout. Go with a good rubber hose (I have an older Craftsman rubber hose)."

"We got one a few years ago.  $6750 with installation.  Powers the whole house except 2 outlets that we never use anyway.  Wife works from home so when powers out she loses work.  Itü__s Pretty rural when I am so we are low on the totem pole and when powers out , sometimes it would be 5-9 hours before it comes back up.  Gas Powered, Generac. My house is a tad over 3000 square feet.  Well worth it especially if you have kids.  Longest we ever used it was last winter during an ice storm, 14 hrs total and used about 70-80 gallons of propane. Biggest Expense was running the gas line piping to the generator.  The unit had to be a certain distance from the our underground propane tank to meet our building codes.  In our case that ended up being pretty much opposite sides of the house. "
"As u/Kuboos765 said, get it tested. You can often bring it to a lab yourself in a ziplock bag if you're in decent sized city.After that, assuming it contains asbestos it's really going to depend how much work you want to do up there; now and in the future. If you really want to air seal and do a pro insulation job you're going to be disturbing the hell out of the stuff. Some people wouldn't be bothered by this, but it sounds like you are. In your situation I would get a few quotes to have it actually removed and have fresh stuff blown in, maybe even with a layer of spray foam depending on a few other factors (climate, current moisture barrier). As someone who has spent \~20 hours up in the attic doing similar work, I would have it removed (pending it fits your budget) and do all of the work in a nice clean attic; you don't get many chances to do that! I'm currently scrambling to get work done before the attic is insulated to meet the rebate deadline for an environmental program we have so I'm basically covered in insulation 24/7."
"Civil engineer here. That's a big big job. Very hard to ballpark without knowing the specifics. I'm in Canada too so I don't want to throw out numbers which may not be applicable. A contactor would be able to give you a number.In your situation, I'd recommend hiring an engineer as well. You don't want to do all the work and then things don't work because the contractor put in a typical 3/4"" water line...Other things:Water: you will have to run a big enough line - probably 2"" or so. Otherwise your pressure at the house will be crappy. Sizing depends on pressure at the city system, and your building elevation.Sewer: Ideally your site would be gently sloping towards the street/city sewer with no high/low points. Do you have low areas on your site? Those will need to be infilled otherwise your sewer could ""come out of the ground"". Do you have any hills/high points along said trench? If so, your sewer will be deep there ($$$). For that long a stretch, I wouldn't go less than 6"". Put clean-outs all along so you can access / flush."
"The pressure in the line is so low, just turn the gas off and go for it. No need to relieve the gas in the line. Just don't try to light anything. I had a gas man tell me once (the guy came out b/c I had a small leak inside the house and couldn't get the meter off) that the pressue is SO low after the meter that you can stop it with your thumb/hand etc if you can't turn it off before the spot you need to work on it. Now that being said, I DONT recommend that at all, but I've done it successfully on a 3/4"" line. Just prepped everything before hand.&amp;#x200B;Also (at least where I used to live), if you call the gas company b/c you have a leak after the meter and they turn the meter off, they are required to do a pressure test of all lines past the meter. If it fails they take the meter and you have to get a plumber out there. The plumber will pressurize the gas system way beyond whats needed, creating more leaks in an older system. Don't get your meter taken kids...it's a HUGE PAIN.. This is why I was given me the advice above."
"yep, once you dig down, you can measure the pipe,  they are standard sizes, and run by the half inch, so its all but impossible to mismeasure, its sized by the internal diameter, but you can measure the outside just the same.&amp;#x200B;You cant use 2 simple couplers unfortunately, since you'll cut out the broken section and the remaining ends are locked in the earth, there is no space to spread them apart to fit in the new peices that need to overlap the old.&amp;#x200B;so you get 1 regular old coupler  and one of these[https://www.homedepot.com/p/Homewerks-Worldwide-2-in-PVC-Compression-Coupling-511-43-2-2H/206667873](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Homewerks-Worldwide-2-in-PVC-Compression-Coupling-511-43-2-2H/206667873)This lets the pipe slip through it, so you can fit it in, then slide it back over the existing pipe in the ground.  Im sure there are videos on youtube if you cant picture it in your mind.  Juse search for compression coupling.  This is very common not just for pools, but also underground water sprinklers."
"Chandeliers can be difficult to price for many electricians because of some unknown factors. 1. Who unpacks the shipping boxes and assembles the chandelier. In your photo that chandelier has a million glass/plastic? pieces. Sometimes the ship individually, sometimes in small sections, etc. Electricians often hire low pay guys to assemble the fixture. Depending how the photoü__d picture is shipped, it could take a few days to unpack and assemble. 2. The rate of $100/fixture to install a standard fixture is a fair rate. I doubt this electrician understands the size of the photographed chandelier. In addition to the scaffolding heü__ll have to hire a helper (or you) to lift it. 3. If the fixture is over 10 pounds youü__re going to want to reinforce the junction box to withstand the weight of the chandelier. If your junction boxes werenü__t prepped during their initial installation to support heavy loads, that chandelier will fall quicker than it gets installed. To reinforce the j box you may have to demo and patch drywall to get supports in. Since it doesnü__t sound like the electricians asked these questions, he may not have much experience with them. Judging by his rate, he probably thinks theyü__re much smaller, or doesnü__t understand what heü__s getting into. Hope that helps!"
"I'm no expert, but why would the windows need to be reinstalled? Flashing just goes under the siding directly above the window and over the head (top) trim of the window, right? Unless there is significant damage to the windows or surrounding area (i.e., the window is somehow ruined or the framing around the windows has rotted out), I'd think that part would be a relatively simple fix.That quote sounds a little bogus to me - just as a general rule of thumb, make sure you have at least three quotes for any significant home project. Also, check out YouTube (ThisOldHouse, HouseImprovements, etc.). Even if you don't plan on doing the work, seeing how it's done properly will help you understand the how and the why, plus it'll give you some foundation for questions/etc. For instance, I personally would wonder what that $25-30K is buying. The costs are going to be in material and labor, so exactly what material and how many hours of labor? Maybe it does all add up and make sense, but do a bit of research and get several quotes. Even if you aren't up for DIYing the project, see if any of your neighbors have a handyman they trust, see if they can come out and take a look, and give an estimate of what it would cost to add a bit of flashing around the windows.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;"
"You probably have mold. Spraying lysol won't solve it. If I was in your shoes, I would try to borrow either a thermal camera, or a drywall moisture sensor probe of some sort. Some places have a rental option for these. You have to figure out where the moisture is, and stop it from coming in first. Otherwise you are just chasing your tail. If you call a professional mold/water remediation company, they will normally bring one along and use it as part of your free estimate. The dehumidifier suggestion is a good one, but you will also need some fans moving the air around. Fans get moisture into the air, dehu removes moisture from the air. Residential use dehu units are pretty garbage, but if you spend near $200 and get a *good* one, you might be OK, depending on square footage.We just had flooding in the area, and I'm dealing with a lot of these style claims where people half-assed things and now their basement ""smells funny."" Mold won't go away, it is everywhere. All you can do is remove the conditions that support it's growth. So get things dry. Then run the Dehu nonstop for another 2 weeks or months to actually get it dry. Good luck. If you're not confident, or willing to do some research, plan on paying for a professional to come in and handle it ASAP. It will only get worse."
"&gt; SMD5050Maybe I'm a lighting snob since this is what I do, but the light you're suggesting is like $13 for 16 feet and it has a little controller that will likely go out after a year and you gotta do it all over. The one we always use is from [WAC Lighting](https://www.amazon.com/WAC-Lighting-LED-T24W-1-WT-Invisiled-Performance/dp/B008A9EK0O/) that's considerably more expensive but has very consistent color temperature and lasts a very long time.  You would be better off using an ELV dimmer it however. Edit, since you commented, deleted your comment, and downvoted me, this was my response:Maybe you're an EE and you know more about what they use to manufacture these but I have never heard anybody refer to lighting their room by the technical name for the individual LEDs so I did a quick search and all that came up was super cheap generic Chinese lighting.Here is the specs for the WAC so if you say they use  SMD5050 I'll have to take your word for it, although Their individual LEDs use .42 watts and what I found on the SMD5050s is .2 watts.  Regardless, I don't need to know how the sausage is made.  All I know is that these have a 5 year warranty, they have a high CRI, they dim beautifully, and I haven't had to go back to replace a single one going back 7 years when we first started using WAC.  I can't say that about any other brand so even if it was the exact same chip, they know how to stick them to their strips the best and their drivers are dimmable.Anyway, that's my advice as someone who has installed this stuff going back to giant magnetic transformers and ambient lights so solder your own chips, go to Home Depot and buy LED rope light, order cheap chinese crap off amazon, whatever. It's your call. You came looking for ideas and I gave mine so take it or leave it. "
"By the time your outside water line springs a leak, it may very well be due for replacement. Proü__s do it right. How old is this line exactly? Policy is often to do the whole line if it leaks as customers will freak out even more if your repair fails in a year.When the regulator was changed, you need to burp the PRV on the hot water tank to get the air out of the tank. And sometimes an old valve leaks after it was touched (sometimes days later). It happens all the time.  Had you considered the possibility that the ü__somethingü__ your wife was told was to keep an eye on the PRV over the next few weeks as he just disturbed it? This would be industry standard as well and a part of the fault here is your wife not conveying information to you properly?  There is no saying exactly why the reg was changed. It is possible it had a fault or poor pressure control. You are just guessing as to if he was right or wrong with ZERO information or evidence to the contrary. Multiple problems are a possibility you know. That also happens all the time.  If you have high pressure, toilets will be prone to leaking constantly.The technician also probably forgot to bring his snap-on crystal ball that would determine if you had a leak outside your house.  As your house probably does not have a pressure gauge before and after the reg like all the industrial models, determining that your outside pipe had a leak was exceptionally difficult and time consuming task and requires installing a port upstream of your main water shutoff valve and then performing a test by closing the valve at the street or meter. Feed pipe leaks are exceptionally rare and a technician swapping a ref for a high water  consumption problem sounds pretty standard.I suggest you reconsider your scathing review after reviewing this. "
"I plan on picking up a heat camera this season to really insulate really well but i winterize the doors by putting weather tape on every single seal on every door not being used, inside AND outside. Get the thicker tape from Home Depot because the tape from Lowe's is thinner and you don't get as much per roll. I've done the whole plastic heat seal on the windows and found that it works decently, depends on how new the windows are I suppose. If you see any holes in the caulking around the windows I'd go get some caulk and fill those in and tape over them with weather tape. As far as heaters go, i've found that PRESTO brand directional dish style heaters work great and can heat a large area. I spent a winter about 5 years ago without any heat due to a broken furnace that my landlord refused to replace, I bought, tested, and returned nearly EVERY style space heater on the market that winter, Presto, Lasko, Honeywell and only the Presto got me nice and toasty but it doesn't heat the air that well, so as soon as you turn it off it gets cold again. I still recommend it over others. Here is a newer model from what I used. https://www.amazon.com/Presto-Parabolic-Electric-Heater-Concentrated/dp/B01M8NLKT1/As others have mentioned, and something that I didn't think of that winter is an electric blanket. I'm still kicking myself for that one as I used to heat up water in my teapot and then would put it under my blanket for awhile before I went to bed. I face palmed so hard the first time a friend of mine came over and was like ""why didn't you just get a heated electric blanket?"".Run hot water once in a while through every sink and faucet, if you have an outdoor spout from an indoor water line running from your basement, make sure the valve in the basement is shut off (if you have one).

thanks for posting this.

what is that pink stuff?
would you recommend it? 
you get what you pay for
"A picture of what you are working with would be helpful. Is it a nut in the wood? Wood threads? Actually a screw and not a bolt?Regarding stripping the threads, general rule of thumb is if it takes more than your fingers to start turning the bolt you likely have the wrong size."
"A regular thermostat should work fine. Maybe yours is either sticking or poorly located, or your house drafty and/or poorly insulated.What's your water temperature set at? If you turn your boiler temperature down it should even out your heat, and may actually be more efficient."
"Agree with the others. Best thing to do with asbestos is to leave it, or cover it. If you have any crumbling bits, these are probably still large particles and not inhalable, but a quick, cheap, easy, safe way to manage any crumble is to coat it with watered down PVA glue spray. "
"Agreeing with everything else said here. Talk to a GC. One recommendation is to support the rafters to be fixed on the inside, then cut the rafters halfway, cut out rotted toplate and rafter. Replace top plate and then sister a new rafter on the side of the old. Bam, good as new."
"Correct, conditions are better, but if getting into the home was going to require a large amount of work, they'd likely take the easy path to set up a nest in the shed.  If that easy path is removed, they'll go the difficult path of trying to chew through to get into the house.  "
"Ditto, I would ditch the scroll piece and paint behind the shelves and the room a warm earth tone, it would break up the beige and highlight your woodwork/floors/that awesome window. Just my opinion :). You could stain the wood, I wouldnü__t paint it, it would lose the character "
"Exactly, carpenters used to be an all around term for building anything from roughing out to finish carpentry like cabinets. Subdivisions created all of these sub categories where they can't do anything beyond their limited scope of cut wood, nail wood, but only one kind of wood."
"Fake plant or stand that leans towards the wall , called s latter shelf . Furniture there will not affect the heat long table legs will put it 3 feet away from the heat find another cable spot , there had to be one for the tv in the living room !! If not add one itü__s very easy "
"Get your water tested so you know whst the problem is before you try to fix it.   Most well water systems have large canister filtets thst use different media and regular backwash to clean the system.   And as someone else noted you can bleach your well annually to kill bacteria"
"Good point. If I get them refinished they should be protected enough to hold up to the moderate wear and tear we might put on it. My main concern was that second part - if I wait will it do irreversible damage the floor, and it sounds like this shouldn't be too much of a problem."
"Gotchya. If it isn't two black wires I think you might have this type of setup.  https://goo.gl/images/kvbBDpDepending on how old the house is (and the way it was originally setup by the electrician) the colors of the wires may be nonstandard, which makes things difficult. "
"Great anecdote - really helps clarify what the long term impact is!It is free-standing, but the deck won't be sitting too high off the ground (only 16""), so hopefully wobble shouldn't be too much of an issue as long as support is deep/sturdy enough. Thanks again for your input!"
"I guess the question is how long do you plan to live there?  Insulating it to an R-19 value might reduce your power bill 20% to 30%, where as insulating it to an R-32 might reduce your summer power bill up to 40%.  Depends on what you want, and how you want this house to perform."
I have enough for the furnace. Just not both that and the upgrade. Itü__s a rural location and about 400 feet of underground wire would have to be run to the house. Can I just turn of the furnace when I do laundry? Iü__d like to be to code and insured should something burn down. 
"I have never tried double sensors.  I honestly don't see a problem doing this, but I am not an electrician.  Here is a webpage that discusses hooking a single sensor into a three-way switch set-up:https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/36504/how-do-i-wire-a-3-way-motion-sensor"
"I have one that's been working fine...with a pedestal sink I'd probably try it out.  Any leak should be apparent pretty quickly.FWIW, PVC is kind of forgiving with lengths and angles since it's a little flexible (and extremely cheap, if you totally goof it up on the first try)."
"I probably should have clarified, but Iü__m currently using a masonry bit (porter cable drill). I actually have a bunch of extra bits so Iü__m not worried about damaging them. Maybe Iü__m just weak af and thatü__s the problem. I will keep trying though. Thank you for your advice!"
"I think I found what I'm looking after doing some research.The part I need is called a thermostatic valve.This one:https://www.amazon.com/Kohler-K-2973-KS-NA-MasterShower-Thermostatic-Integrated/dp/B006XA8HM4/ even allows precise temperature control,which is what I'm looking for."
"I was just saying the mud on the opposite wall was newer/less dry than the wall I was working on, but whatever...itü__s sounding like my mud just needs to dry more. And itü__s ok to soften the knife corners? They are always causing me trouble. That sounds like an awesome tip. "
"I went out and threw a handful of water on the section that gets the most direct sun -- some of it soaked in, but a lot just rolled off. The installer had called the wood 'wet', as at one point he was cutting planks with a table saw and it was actually throwing water off the saw."
"I would suggest looking at life proof flooring at Home Depot.  They are a little bit more costly but are really durable, basically waterproof, and they have a really nice natural grey and brown option that I was torn between.  If you can afford them, they are completely worth it."
"I'm assuming the wall was jacked beforehand?In general that's just sand and mud and sand and mud until it's right--assuming the underlying structure is still okay.If you're putting up a backsplash you can continue that along the side. Then you only have to get it good enough."
I'm in the midst of a similar project. My first home. Closed in December last year. 1930s cottage. Gutted the kitchen. Have ikea cabinets everywhere. Doing drywall this weekend. Redid a bathroom the first month I moved in. It's a lot of work but I can't wait for the new kitchen. 
"I've found that a mixture of 40% dish soap to 60% water and a few drops of tea tree oil in a spray bottle that shoots in a stream works better and is safer than any pest spray. It drops wasps instantly, kills roaches, spiders, ants, flies, etc and its safe for children and pets. "
"I've used it! I covered the front of my microwave and then I attempted to do my deep freezer and wow, harder than I thought. There were bubbles everywhere so I gave up lol if you have enough time and patience I'm sure you can pull it off. Bought mine at Home Depot for about $16. "
"IMO, from pic, might be Creeping Charlie, an invasive weed with small purple flowers which chokes out grass. Had in lawn in Northern IL. Tried everything, including pre-emergence weed killer that specifically listed Creeping Charlie. Finally got rid of it by selling house. Lol. "
"If that's a natural stone, use 100% pure silicone in the colour of choice (closest match to the stone colour). Follow u/cursedsun's adviceWhite will stand out, clear won't hide the old join.I'd wipe with methylated spirits on a rag to get away any old crud before siliconing. "
"If your deck finish failed in less than a year, then preparation before painting was not adequate. If you're correct about it being painted a few months before you purchased it, then it is highly likely the seller did nothing to prepare the wood for paint to adhere successfully. "
"Is the piping visible in the basement?  If so, there should be shut-offs inside near the individual spigots or a main shut-off closer to where the water supply enters the basement.  Or youü__re like me and had no shut-off and had to install one on the spigot piping.  So worth it."
It's perfectly safe with these style outlets. If you saw one in person you would understand. I work in a commercial building where certain clients cannot have a lot of down time so these make it easy to swap quickly and without shutting off power to potentially multiple offices. 
"Most likely culprit is either the window frame needs recaulked, or the step flashing going up the right side wall isn't done properly.How long ago was the roof done? It looks recent but the potato cam isn't super clear.Either way, you chose correctly to get a roofer up there."
"Not sure what you use for a heated floor but ditra heat is 1/4"" thick. Regardless, removing the tile is the way to go here. Are you assuming OP is going to run water tubes from a boiler to heat the floor? A simple heated tile floor system is no more than 1/2"". This is bad advice "
"Oh gosh, I thought your first pic was the ""before"" and almost got super annoyed that you had such snobbish tastes that you would tear that up as soon as you bought it......aaaaand then I read the caption. Good work, I like that cabinet wood you guys chose! (and everything else)"
"Regarding shark bites, I've never met anyone who has seen one fail first hand, always someone they knew, or heard from someone else. I recall one guy here on Reddit that had one fail, but he determined it was because he didn't debur the copper pipe before pushing the fitting on. "
"Sorry, it was d-ring shackle on the tow hitch of a rusty old farm truck and it's in no danger of failing anyone in the junk yard.  But yes you are correct, most trucks have bumper/tow hooks or mounts for this purpose specifically.  100% correct the trailer hitch is for trailers. "
"Spackle or wood filler would work fine if you at all have eyes and can shape an edge. Get a clean knife, It will work fine, look fine and it stays dry, you won't have issues. If you think a viscous epoxy is going to work well to fill a horizontal issue, you've not used it often. "
"Thanks for all the comments!  Any further feedback on what u-value I actually NEED?  And whether or not I was being fed a line of BS about the standards changing in 2020?  I havenü__t been able to find anything on that.  If it is BS, that makes choosing the final contractor easy."
"Thanks for the information! I went up in the attic right after we noticed water, but with all the insulation I had a difficult time walking to be above the affected area. I didnü__t notice anything out of the ordinary but as you mentioned if itü__s really small maybe I missed it "
"That goes for every part bin in every store everywhere, fastener, electrical, plumbing, whatever.  Better stores have bins to put the stray fasteners in, so someone can fix it.  At the home depot, I tend to put them on the floor, if it's not instantly obvious where they belong.  "
"That's a very good question which I don't know the answer to.  I do know most (all?) 15A outlets also have some fine print saying they are rated for 20A pass through current.EDIT:  Another protection is that 20A appliances should have the 20A plug and not fit into a 15A outlet."
"Thatü__s an odd valve to use for a gas line,  but like someone else said, put some soapy water around it and the bubbles will tell you where itü__s leaking.  Youü__d likely just need to replace the valve though - gate valves are crappy at the best of times, particularly old ones."
"The rule of thumb is to never set the thermostat below 55F in winter climatesEspecially on the first floor in a cold climate you should not turn the heat completely off when you are not home. Your upstairs neighbors get your heat and they can be more casual about minimum temps."
"These look like old work boxes to begin with that were mounted to the drywall because they have flanges on the front. Maybe he can just pull them through and attach to drywall either with the screw clips or with Madison straps.Are they securely mounted to studs or do they move?"
"They will probably use the dirt, and if not, there is a ready market for it.  Also, there is liability involved.That said, it can't hurt to ask.  Find out who's in charge, find out what he drinks, and bring him a six pack.  If he says yes, bring him a 24 pack when you are done."
"This x1000.  I can't get contractors to come give a bid, and if they do, I can't get them to actually start on the work.I expect the winter will help with this and if rates continue to climb it will clam up money a little and next year will be friendlier.  OP, wait, if you can."
"Weird.  There is a tensioner that keeps the belt tight.   It has not seized, has it?The motors on those things are damn near bulletproof (unless they get wet), so it seems unlikely that it could be the culprit.  Do you smell the burning rubber with the back of the machine off?"
Yeah I think we may put an offer down and possibly back out if the inspector/contractor we bring along say it isnü__t possible to remedy. I just love the house so much; itü__s a tiny home in a strip of woods overlooking the Hudson River. Itü__s too unique to give up on just yet. 
"You can get a duct cleaning brush up to 20 feet long:https://www.amazon.com/20ft-Dryer-Duct-Cleaning-Kit/dp/B074TBD8H4Once it is clean, you can keep it that way with an auxiliary lint trap:https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-4-in-Dryer-Duct-Lint-Trap-PCLT4WHD/206526654"
"You can use both, the thermostat for the central air will turn it off if the house is warmer than needbe because the wall heater is running. In your case, I think it would be ideal to heat that room with. You can get a 10k BTU unit that would be perfect. I'm using a 30k BTU unit."
"You have been extremely helpful with your replies. Thank you! One more follow up question.  I know some people swear by using bleach for most cleaning. What are your thoughts on this? Oh and for hand soap I use Softsoap. Any thoughts on that one or if one you like even better? "
"Your link doesn't work, but that's basically the definition of a switch, a disconnect between a line and a load. Unless your device is wireless and requires a router, you have to have a line and a load. The load isn't ""another live wire"" it's dead unless the switch is activated. "
"Your plan sounds really good, the house looks great, but the driveway is done for and the landscaping is overgrown.Check out r/lawncare for some tips on what to do with the lawn. Depending on where you are, it might not be too late to put down herbicide and overseed this fall. "
"[Just found the same (or very similar) assortment at HD. ](https://i.imgur.com/QX3wtMT.jpg) Itü__s in with the faucet repair stuff. It might be worth a shot to see if yours carries the same thing. Edit: if you can fish the old one out first, you might find the exact right one. "
"depends on the size of the existing pipe and what the BTU demands are. If the gas line is 1/2"" and its feeding a 120,000BTU furnace and a gas hot water heater, that line is too small to tap into for any more gas appliances.  As for cost its all subjective to what needs to be done"
"i understand that if you burn fires throughout the season on a regular basis its good to sweep once a year, however, we have a vacation house where we burn 10-15 nights a year. how often should we get the chimney cleaned out?&amp;#x200B;edit: also, we never burn pine only oak"
"i'm not familiar with IRC as i only work on commercial projects, but i can't imagine that mechanical ventilation is the only compliance path, surely natural ventilation is also an option, like the IMC?my company doesn't keep copies of the IRC around, or i'd just check myself..."
"A good adjustable wrench _˘Æ_˘Æ and a few Allen keys can get you to the cartridge pretty easily, and i would recommend pulling up the exploded view of your faucet from the manufacturerü__s website. If the cartridge is clean when you dismantle it, you should shut the general (house) shut-off valve and look behind the [monohandleü__s] chrome plaque. There should be two flat screw-looking valves at either sides of the cartridge hub. Dirt could be lodged in the left (hot side) valve, right before reaching the cartridge. Hope it helps!"
"Balancing could help, but first try removing the vent grille and reaching inside, there should be a damper not far in, you should be able to reach it, if it's there. Becarefull there are most likely screws sticking out and tin can get sharp. If that's not the issue it sound like you may not have enough return air for that room. Is there a large floor or wall grille covered by anything? In the room or near it?Not all rooms have them so don't panic if there isn't one. Does this happen if the door is left open or just closed?"
"Both Ecobee and Nest have remote thermostats. I personally bought the Ecobee because at the time (about 2 years ago) Nest did not offer this. Ecobee calls them lil' bees. My house is a ranch home. Bedroom is on one end of the house, directly about the furnace, and thermostat is in the living room at other end of the house. So during the day Ecobee uses the main thermostat, then at night at around 8, it switches to read the lil' bee in my bedroom. Works great. They can be set to auto detect which room you are in and all that jazz. "
"Flush the drywall up with the jamb and then grab some corner bead. The plastic ones will be fine, donü__t forget your corner bead adhesive. One thing though, it looks like you didnü__t leave any room to shim your jamb. Next time make sure to frame your opening larger than the jamb, 1/4-3/8ü_ù on each side and above is usually aightEdit: Thatü__s what I love about this sub. The guy who does it for a living gets downvoted with proper advise and the weekend warrior, just bought a house so he knows everything gets pushed to the top."
"I donü__t think you need that aav. Where does the vertical 2ü_ù line connect to behind the aav?  Is that the vent? How far is the 3ü_ù line from the p-trap? Itü__s likely sufficient as a vent. A 3ü_ù has DFU of 48. Thatü__s enough to support 3 bathrooms, a kitchen, laundry and the some. If you want to keep the aav you need to cut it out and then it around (I seriously doubt you need it). Next time, number your connections, itü__s make sure you donü__t make these mistakes. Theyü__re super annoying to fix and super easy to avoid. "
"It could also be mildew, which isnü__t as bad. Mildew isnü__t as black as certain mold. I would say it is a dark gray. Usually mist from normal showering wonü__t cause mold it is more likely to cause mildew which sits on the surface. I would be concerned with the leak though mold forms when a surface is allowed to stay saturated with water.  For example you get a small leak under the sink and donü__t catch it for a while. I would take bleach and water and just clean it in case. If possible I would try to look in the attic better. "
"Running the fan on your AC isnü__t all that expensive, $20 a month maybe, itü__s the actual cooling part that is expensive to run. But I wouldnü__t recommend running the fan since you live in Louisiana, it brings the outside humid air in the house and makes everything feel sticky. I live in Mississippi so Iü__m well aware of our humidity problems. Youü__ll be able to notice the humidity issue after just a couple hours running the fan with no cooling. When you run the cooling part with it, it actually takes humidity out of the air."
"The new and old concretes will likely expand at different rates.  To prevent them pushing against each other and cracking, you need a small gap (usually ~1/4"") between them to allow for expansion.This gap is usually either the width of a plywood form that is later filled with a backer rod and caulked with an epoxy, or can be some form of bitumen or asphaltic expansion material that has some give to it.  If you look into your local highway DOT highway design manual that should give you an idea of what is recommended in your area."
"The rough opening size is what matters.  I'm 95% sure a standard 36"" door will work fine in your case.  You should remove the old door &amp; measure the rough opening size to be sure, but you'll probably find it has something like 37x81 rough opening with shims to hold it plumb &amp; level.Don't try and replace just the door panel.  Get a full prehung door, replace the jamb and everything.  Sounds like more work but it really isn't, and it will open/close much more smoothly than trying to fit a new panel into an existing jamb.  "
"This is the problem I have with this. First I have to be a mini postal worker stamping things, removing barcodes, etc. Then the actual postal worker gets annoyed at having to do his part. So now in addition to all the sorting and labelling, I am required to run it to the physical office.And the worst of it is, the volume went *up* after a couple of years once the forwarding order expired. Years of diligently marking and returning post and we get items daily for the previous owners and our postal carrier is as annoyed as we are. "
When our washer died we bought a new washer &amp; dryer from Sears and had it delivered the next day. Also bought a new dishwasher from Sears - took 2 days to be delivered PLUS they price matched another stores sale price! Both Loweü__s and Home Depot had anywhere from 2-6 week wait times on appliances which is a deal breaker for me. I needed my washer sooner than 6 weeks &amp; Sears offered next day delivery so theyü__re my go-to appliance people now. Be sure to ask when it will be available and when will it arrive at your home. 
"You can move the collar ties as high as you want. Just need to be in the top third of the roof.Also I did closed cell spray foam. High r value, not vapor permeable, but expensive and potentially unhealthy (varies depending on brand)Be sure do check how many inches of closed cell/rigid foam you need before you hit a condensation point (based on your climate). You want that condensation point to fall in a non vapor permeable form of insulation (dense foam - xps or closed cell). To prevent accumulating water, and therefore mold. "
"You're supposed to use caulk instead of grout anywhere the tile changes plane or meets another surface. For example where a wall meets the floor or another wall. It's to prevent cracks from expansion. So the caulk in that bottom area is perfectly normal, but I've never seen the ""dip"" before. Given that it's a pre-fab shower base I'm sure the dips are supposed to be there, but not sure why. As for repairs - remove all the old caulk around the base and re-caulk. You can find color-matched silicone caulk at the local box stores. "
It really depends I would definitely recommend getting some quotes the best thing to do would be to remove the paneling install rigid foam or regular insulation then put back new paneling or existing if you can take it off easy. Last time I did a small back house in California prices will vary state to state ran about $800. That was to drill the holes then they blow in blow in insulation. On that job we had stuccoed exterior walls they actually did it from the exterior then patch the stucco that was included in their price came out nice. Definitely get a quote. As far as the floor goes they have a grid  you can install then put new tile over it that will warm the floor call Daltile look into it a great product.

"There is opportunity cost with the roof as well. He has to replace his roof, he already said. Therefore, whatever that roof costs needs to be deducted for the initial investment of $60,000. A roof in my neighborhood would probably cost me 5 to $10,000, even on a larger house such as mine. I don't know what that's like in other areas, but a customer of mine just put $25,000 into a roof. That means that you're only considering a $35,000 investment in solar. Therefore, the rate of return is closer to 12% and there are not a lot of places right now where you're earning that. Additionally, there is something to be said for the early adopters. They may spend a little bit of extra money to help the rest of us gain an economy of scale and those people are not to be discouraged but admired."
"[Mine](https://i.imgur.com/MroQnkp.jpg) came out great (no trim at the moment because I popped it off to refinish it). Looks like a new door. I don't have $250 for a new one, but I *did* have $30 for spray paint and Bondo. Can't even tell where the [repairs are](https://i.imgur.com/wslrztd.jpg). Like I said: didn't notice the picture at first... would've suggested Bondo and spray paint from the get-go. I thought we were talking about an *original* 80 year old door. Much tougher to pretty up an old worn wood door than a construction-grade steel entry door. Could even do what I did with my dad's shed door and paint the inset areas a different color for a two-tone.

"&gt;Should I have them rip up the tile and repair under it?Nope.  Not necessary.  Concrete cracks.  It always does, so unless the tiles are cracking as well, it isn't a big deal/&gt;Do they need to remove the walls and repair under those.Nope.  As the contractor said, a crack in the floor doesn't mean the wall will crack.  Now, if there is a major structural issue, you have bigger problems, and removing drywall will be the least of your problems, but I doubt that is the issue if everything is still plumb and level.&gt;Should I be concerned that it went up the walls and the walls will leak?Not unless you see signs of a leak&gt;Will that concrete repair be enough to keep the water from coming through the floor?Shouldn't be an issue unless you already have water coming up through the floor.  Concrete is porous and water easily passes through it.  The patch the contractor is proposing is cosmetic.  It won't prevent water seepage if you already have a water problem, but the crack won't immediately result in water coming up."
"A window opening needs flashing at both the head and sill. So you should not be cutting the opening the exact size anyway. You need to cut high and low enough to get the flashing installed and the brick will need to be relaid to create the new head and sill. You will also need to cut out enough on both sides of the head to install the lintel. You may also need to tooth out the jambs unless you donü__t mind seeing a cut edge or you plan on trimming it out to the face of the brick. There are different ways to go about the opening not working to the coursing of the brick. You could install the lintel at the next course above your desired height and deal with the gap above the window with caulk if itü__s not too big or a piece of trim. You could also rip the brick down at the desired height under the bearing locations. You then would have to install a ripped course on the lintel to get back with the coursing of the wall. Or instead of the ripped course you could do a soldier course the height of ripped course plus the next course up. "
"We just dealt with a similar problem, although I don't know if this will work if you won't have cabinets on either side.  A ceiling support was in the ideal path of our range duct, so we had to extend it out forward from the wall 6-7"" at the ceiling, meaning our stainless steel duct cover wouldn't fit over the top 8 inches.  We looked all over for ideas and decided to basically build a wood soffit (which I wasn't crazy about at first because I had already demo'ed a few soffits in this kitchen at the beginning).I took a few 3x8 boards of red oak (same wood as the flooring in the rest of the house), stained it dark and applied poly.  Glued the boards together, and also attached brackets/strips of wood across to give it some added rigidity.  Then it just fit around the ductwork.  [Photos here.](https://imgur.com/a/bqQM6ZW)It turned out to be fairly simple to do.  I think my only mistake was that I probably should have assembled the two soffit pieces before I stained and poly'ed (I finished the boards first, then cut and assembled)."
"I would get some 6mm poly and cut out a few 2feet by 2 feet pieces and place them in a few different areas and tape down the edges with some tuck tape our something will seal it good and leave it for at least 24 hours. This is basically a poor mans moisture test. There are more professional ways of testing for moisture but some of the testing tools can be fairly expensive.  Sounds like you could have an alkali or chloride issue as well. You might want to hire a pro to do this work. As for levelling, most products want the floor flat to within 1/8th of an inch over 6 feet or 3/16 of an inch over 10 feet. Which is really flat. Being level isn't important, it is more of a preference. Being flat is the important part. At the bare minimum it should be patched out with a skim coat and patching compound like Ardex feather finish or Uzin 888. Those are just some examples of products.  The best way is to use a self levelling product if the floor is relatively level. This stuff can be a pain in the ass to work with. If there are any crack or holes or anything in the concrete or walls or vents you will need to get them sealed up really good. This stuff flows like water for 45 minutes and will find any hole or crack it can and will just keep flowing until it starts to set up. That goes for around the bottom of the framing and any vents, cracks, holes or whatever else in the floor. Also will need to build a dam at any doorway or areas where you want it to stop.  I've seen some real nightmares where people have filled up the vents and had the leveller  flow through the vents down into the roof of the garage and furnace in the basement. I would honestly hire a pro with a good reputation in the area if you can afford it otherwise do as much research as you can and start with the moisture issues."

Thank you for the advice!
Thank you for your reply!
Thank you! Great insight 
Thank you! Posted a photo
Thanks for the feedback! 
Thanks for the insight!! 
Thanks for the knowledge!
Thanks this is what I did
That can't be up to code.
That looks like subfloor.
That one needs batteries?
That's the one! Thank you

worst money I ever spent.
ü__ is different than ü__
"&gt; 120v AC can't be switched with cheap solid-state components like DC can.Sure it can. Relays cost like 50 cents, and solid state relays (yes, AC compatible) are like $5-10.I'm not saying it would be cheap in the end, but the individual parts to do it sure aren't expensive."
"&gt; When I built, I put in outlets beyond the requirements. This speaks to my cardinal rule of wiring outlets:  I've never ever walked in a room and said ""wow, this room has too many outlets!"".  I've walked in a *lot* of rooms and said ""damn, I wish this room had more outlets""."
"&gt;3) Iü__d like to install vinyl (maybe $2.50 per sqft) on top of the existing flooring if possible to save cost on tearing up the floorsYou can uplift the existing flooring in less than a day, easily DIYable. Just saying.As far as pricing goes, get a few quotes/estimates..?"
"**Not code, but works.**Pig-tail a new length of 12-2 and wire it to a temporary outlet. Cap the others for now. Plug a vacuum into your temp outlet and turn it on. As you flip a breaker, you'll hear the vacuum from across the house. Label. Repeat for the other three circuits."
"After looking at them more, I think they are frost free but one looks like an older model, without the anti-siphon part. Both are Woodfords but one has a leak and is beat to hell. I'm going to get that one replaced and just cover the other one with that faucet sock someone linked."
"All you can do is to clean out the cracks and apply new exterior caulking.  I use this stuff:https://www.homedepot.com/p/Sikaflex-29-oz-Gray-Self-Leveling-Sealant-106711/202523824I'd use a thin masonry blade on an angle grinder to clean it out and prepare it for the new caulk."
"Can you expand on attaching posts to concrete? Because everything I have see has literally been just bolt it down with an EZ post.I do have the advantage of the fence being protected from straight-line winds, and he tops of both end posts will be bolted to the house and garage. "
"Dunno generally speaking, but if you are the genius like my previous owner, he hard wired cheap ass puck lights to the cabinets and now it requires to remove the cabinets and access the wall area where he had the workers install the puck light hard wired into the system (I think)."
"For me I would either lower the baseboard, install shoe, or my personal feelings leave it as it is. When you're dealing with wood there is going to be a lot of movement and even if you were to completely lower your base so it's it's closer it will probably open up again with time."
Get a bag of new fastners and replace the ones that are messed up.You might consider getting a little fatter screw in case the lath underneath is wallowed out and you could always get some hd silicone caulk and daub the oldscrew heads after making sure the remaing screws are snug 
"Good point. It is enclosed. One door to the outside, one door to the inside. Jackets and boots go here, so Iü__m trying to avoid having a moist cold winter. Is 500-750w not overkill? I used to have a space heater at 1000 and it was a hot beast. Iü__m thinking 250w is ideal here?"
"Has anyone tried listing their services at ""$4K flat."" I wonder if there would be a market for that. I expect you'd have to have a super good reputation to pull it off.  Also, at that rate, even if it took you 100 hours to list and sell a home, you'd be making $40 /hr. Not bad."
"Have you tried plumbing tape around the threads when youü__re screwing the hose on?The sillcock is definitely an old one, but if you canü__t access the basement/crawlspace behind that brick to install a full frost-free sillcock then you might as well spend a buck on thread tape."
"He shouldn't have done that, and it's not a good thing, but you're not going to die. Ideally that room (if not the home) would be specially cleaned now for asbestos dust. But I don't know how much you're willing to spend. A normal shopvac like he used is not going to do anything. "
"Highly doubt that is the original roof. Keeping it clean is a good idea. And get rid of the moss too, it holds water.https://www.bing.com/search?q=how+to+remove+moss+from+asphalt+roof&amp;lvl=1&amp;FORM=PMETIS&amp;filters=segment%3a%22techhelp%22+ans%3a%22cvns%22+level%3a%221%22"
I haven't tried it but will try it this weekend! We need to replace the hose anyways as they also did something to the end of it (attached a sprayer and it also won't come off) so we will definitely see what we can do. I didn't even know that a hose had to come off before winter. 
"I think your original spelling/typo was throwing me off from understanding what you meant.  That would be a viable solution, would just need something high enough to make sure it doesn't run right past at high velocity, and that the gutters were sized for whatever volume of water."
I would use a floor scraper to get the tiles up and maybe knock off some of the adhesive. then a multi-tool with the correct bit for getting the nails and a scraper attachment. You want the floor to be pretty smooth because most lvp will show bumps and stuff below it after a while
"I've added the plate information to the post.  Preliminary googling of this HCFC-22, it doesn't look good.  Because it doesn't seem like it's going to rise above 80 degrees for an extended time for the rest of the year in South Carolina, I might just wait to get a new system ='(. "
"I've read that clover is a sign of a nitrogen deficiant lawn! And yes there is a bacteria that grows on clover roots which will convert regular old N2 into the kind that can be absorbed by plants, but I have wide patches of it which are choking out sun from more preferable grass. "
"If the lights are tripping from the breaker I'd say its most likely a fuse from the microwave itself, I'd reccomend plugging the microwave into a different power outlet and seeing if it then works, if it doesn't I'd say open up the microwaves main plug to check the fuse, good luck"
"If they are the old heat detectors there should be a big control box somewhere, mine had a bunch of buttons on it, the transformer, electric meter and a big alarm bell. I had heat detectors all over my house, also had panic buttons here and there that could trigger the alarm bell."
"In addition to the moisture, a nice wrapped up (in a tarp or similar) AC compressor makes a wonderful hibernation spot for mice and other little critters. Their urine can be very acidic and eat through metal/aluminum, etc. so depending on where/how they nest it can be really bad. "
"Instead of getting them to change *their* habits, offer to do what someone suggested and weather strip their door, too. If the stoner truly is that lazy, he won't do it himself and won't change his habits, but might not care if you buy &amp; install the weather stripping yourself."
"Make sure that full removal of all materials and cleanup is included. Insist on ice shield thats higher than code requires. Full removal of all old shingles and paper (dont let them go over top). Repair and replacement of roof sheathing where required. Are you replacing gutters?"
"My burners have the clicky clicky lighter.  I was wondering if it was an oven pilot, but when I turn the oven on it works... warms up etc.  So I don't know about that either.&amp;#x200B;It's a kenmore gas stove if that makes a difference... don't have the model number on hand."
"Neither. I don't think baking soda will do anything for your carpet. Have it cleaned, and if it still smells have it cleaned again or replaced. If you want to be thorough, you could spot clean any stained or smelly areas with some carpet cleaner before you clean the whole carpet. "
"Noone can tell you costs on something like this as there are way too many variables.  Even if it was a simple install it's impossible to know because labor costs vary from town to town and contractor to contractor.Only way to know for sure is seek multiple bids and compare them."
"Normally there is a ball-ended handled that hooks/slots into a holder, that keeps the pressure on it to be snapped shut. When you would use it, you would unhook the handle and it would pop up and open. Usually is pretty apparent. You might find it on the sides of the mantle/stack?"
"Ok so I recently purchased a home and the attached garage has the opener plugging into an adjacent socket/outlet adapter. There are no extension cords or anything, but I've thought about having this changed. How safe/unsafe is it to have the opener plugged into a socket converter?"
"Putting in dowels is a good idea, as would be chemically anchoring them (some sort of epoxy).  Ideally youü__d roughen the surface of the existing concrete as well.Other than those 2 things as long as the new concrete gets handled and poured correctly you should be good to go!"
"Rereading this, I agree sewer gas is the likely culprit, especially if theres no visible trap downstream of the washer drain line and the top is open.OP, waft some air from the end of the pipe the washer discharges into.  Odds are pretty good you'll find the source of the smell."
"Thank you for your help. I am fairly certain there are two wires, but I'll have to check when I get home.   So, if that is the case, I would just replace the current outlet with a dual switch outlet and run some wire from the second switch to the vanity light (behind the wall)? "
"Thanks for the info! The ü__correctü_ù way seems like the pricier but cleaner looking option. Correct that I donü__t have attic access as this is the 3rd floor of 4 story apartment. Fine with covering the spackling and painting on my end, but good to know that wonü__t be covered. "
"The numbering is a tad odd, but the order is correct.Fans don't start well on ""slow"", and it's actually bad for them, so they make it go from OFF&gt;FAST&gt;SLOW intentionally to give it a kick start from a dead stop.[Edited because I typed the damn order wrong the first time]"
"The rat meant no harm. They are very intelligent creatures and I'm sure they found an opening for the pipe in, but couldn't get back out. DON'T just poison them all. That could hurt every creature in the long run, including yourself. Your solution is in closing their main entrance"
Then easiest is either the spray foam or a layer of vapor barrier over the floor and the cellulose on top of the vapor barrier or spray foam. Just be sure you run any electrical youü__d ever want to add first and donü__t block the soffits.   Leave the floor and go over everything.
"This is an excellent time to buy (stores are marking this duck tape in a spray can down) as its end of summer and they need the shelf space, donü__t let this opportunity slip past. Cans going for $1.25 cans normally sell for $3.75. I usually get a box of 12. For what itü__s worth."
"Use veneer stone looks awesome and itü__s relatively easy to install , Home Depot has several selections at about $5 a foot Do not put anything flammable on there like 2x4 or strapping , code requires a 2ü_ù air space ( were I am ) and maybe more in your area Good luck ! _˘Æ_˘Æ "

"Wait, wouldn't you have to cut that lathe in any case?Secondly, I don't think your getting out of this without some work you don't want to do. Depending on the grain of that 2x4 you might be able to just split the thing down to a cut saving you a bunch of really awkward sawing. "
What about the fridge to the right of the sink and dishwasher to the right of the stove? Microwave could then be above stove or dishwasher (stove needs ventilation btw) Itü__s nice to have prep area on either side of the stove especially with the laundry/pantry just next to that. 
"What's your reason for misrepresenting me and not mentioning that I typed r/plumbing? I also refer people to Mike Holt forum for all things electrical, even though I've never had a bad encounter with any r/electricians mods. I like both forums and most of the crowds within them."
"Wolf and Sub-Zero kitchen appliances are fantastic. They're very expensive, but they're absolutely worth the money if your kitchen is one of your biggest priorities.Viking appliances are consumer-grade masquerading as professional grade. They are absolutely NOT worth the money."
"Yeah, I agree, I wish they would have. They didn't really talk to me about it. The problem with 2-3"" is that the gap between the ledger board and the siding is a bit bigger than it should be at about 2.5"". And I couldn't find 3"" x 4"" flashing. All are either too big or too small."
Yes we actually are planning on adding open walnut shelves on the back wall and a walnut countertop under the sink which I think Will help with some contrast and character. Eventually I would love to play around with the back cupboards a bit but not in the budget this go-round. :)
absolutely not it's easier to work elevated garden beds cuz leaning over for extended periods of time is very strenuous on your back and it's even worse working on your knees. Plus any kind of wash out from washing your patio you do not want to directly wash into your garden beds.
"in the attic on one wire set ... twist the black and the white wires together.. on your multimeter set the test to ohmsohms test is to test if there is a cut in the wire / continuitywhen you find the pair that has the highest reading you know its the one you twisted together"
"... Your electrical situation sounds like mine, scary fuses and subpanel. Bonus: my house was retrofitted with gas service at some point, and they ran the gas pipe directly in front of the fuse box, making it impossible to open the fuse box without removing the door at its hinges...It's to the point where everyone I've had in to look at it has noped and refused to touch it. I should probably just burn the place down and collect the insurance money at this point. Silver lining, it'll probably burn itself down for me at some point."
"8"" hole is pretty large to patch without filling it in with a piece of drywall first as a backer. i would recommend getting a small piece of drywall and fitting it in the hole, then you can take a scrap piece of like pine 1x6 just a bit oversize of the hole and use drywall screws to affix it to the actual ceiling, then you have a backer to screw the filler piece in, then you can use a drywall repair mesh, mud and sand to a smooth finish, you may need to do a few coats of mud to get feathered out to not notice the patch. good luck. "
"Absolutely. Those cheap units are probably fine if you use a sled and work on small parts, but having to rely on a fence that can't be made square and flexes under most working conditions? Practically begging to get a workpiece thrown at you. Even a really sharp thin kerf blade won't cure all the ills there. Just not worth it to go cheap on those sorts of tools. Now, that said I am happy to buy an economy tool where appropriate. No shame in trying to find a good balance of price and performance; just need to evaluate accordingly."
And your tankless has to have a delta T (ability to raise the water temperature by x degrees over the incoming water temp) appropriate for your climate.  I wanted a delta T of at least 70 degrees to compensate for the cold groundwater we typically see where I live in the winters.  Incoming winter water temp at the mid 40s plus 70 degrees added by the tankless can theoretically give me 115 degree shower.  I'm not sure what typical delta T is used for rating tankless units but when I shopped around I saw a typical 40-50 degree value.
"Based on a conversation I had with my code enforcement officer while planning my home improvements, do not bring it to the attention of the township. If there was no permit pulled, the township has no way to verify that the work done was to code. If you try to sell the house as having the addition, the buyer's bank will ask the township for permit records and then can pull the funding if something is missing. And the code officer can make you open up walls to inspect electric, plumbing, fireblocking, etc. It's all about liability. "
"I lived in one of those cookie cutter houses at one point. AFCI requirements were new at the time, so I guess AFCI breakers were still kind of expensive (like $50, big deal). As a result, all the bedrooms were on a single circuit (including the lights), with all the receptacles daisy chained with back stab wiring. If I plugged in the vacuum cleaner at the end of the chain, all the lights would dim and the voltage would drop to around 100 V.  If the vacuum uses 12A, that's about 240W being dissipated somewhere in the wall. Not good."
"I mean, you could pour a leveling compound like Arditex or Henry's 555. It takes some prep work and you'll have to make little dams out of foam board, paper plates, and hot glue so it doesn't flow down the opening the pipe comes through. [I've done it before in my own bathroom](https://www.imgur.com/a/EIjfjnm) (album, there... uploaded out of order, but you get the gist of it). Worked very well. Floor is dead level. It'll adhere to plywood as long as you staple down chicken wire and use the appropriate primer for leveling compound."
"That's always the tradeoff you have to consider. If doing it yourself is not a practical option, then hunt around for the best available pre-built.My problem with the built sheds is that while they roofs tend to be fine, and costs are often ok, walls and floors tend to be made of materials that don't stand up to the weather well. And so they don't last as long as my shed will. I built one 10 years ago that I expect to be using for the next 40. Now I may have to do some repair at some point, but I don't expect to have to replace. "
"Two of my friends went with Bosch recently after hearing all of the stories of their high quality. Both had appliances die within  5 years and needed to buy new ones. I feel like ""Bosch is very good quality"" isn't necessarily true anymore. Edit: according to [this article](https://blog.yaleappliance.com/most-reliable-dishwashers-2018), Bosch dishwashers had a higher repair rate though their Benchmark line had a much better rate. Whirlpool was even better though. I wonder how it is with stoves though. I heard Bosch is good there. "
"We are doing this at work actually for a client. The thing with shrinkage is wood doesn't shrink much with the gain but shrinks a lot across the grain. The thing though is adding a picture frame edge is you need to add lots and lots of backing for the pictureframe or else you will have nothing to screw to at the ends resulting in the boards flopping down at the ends. For the shrinkage bump the boards side to side and as it shrinks you will end up with a 1/4 inch gap.:edit: I can take a picture at work to show what I mean tomorrow"
"Wow! I LOVE the bathroom. Like, I might need to steal that tile and re do my master with that. Looks so clean. This whole house is so well done. Really clean, really nice work.We have some flips in my neighborhood, and they started out really great but then they went cheap on appliances/cabinets, etc. I really like that Ikea cabinetry and the stove/fridge you have is nicer than mine!The stained floors look really great. I am now a fan of the darker stained wood.Thanks for sharing this. Super well done and really inspiring!"
"Yeah that's pretty normal. I don't have photos but last time I demoed a shower, I cut the niche and  through the Sheetrock on other side of the wall, screwed in another piece of sheetrock on the adjacent wall with 16 screws around the peremeter per niche as well as glued with wall board adhesive, then glued the cement board on the shower side to the sheetrock on the internal side of the adjacent wall with some heavy duty construction adhesive. Same shower in the reference photo I provided, just don't have photos of the other side. "
"Your kitchen counter receptacles should be on their own 20 amp circuit, even better if there are two separate circuits serving your counter area and sometimes also your dining room receptacles but most likely they are not because of the age of your home. The washer and dryer should be on a separate 20 amp circuit dedicated just for those appliances assuming it is a gas dryer. Your circuits are all jumbled up from 60+ years of handy work in the house. If it were me I'd hire a licensed electrician to sort at least those circuits out."
"Save yourself some money and see if you can find anything at Sears outlet or scratch and dent areas of other appliance stores. Don't buy floor models. Open box is perfect.Stay away from Samsung and I'm just not a fan of GE in anything but a range. Having said that, many appliances are made by the same manufacturer.I personally like Kenmore and Whirlpool products and have had good success with them. Yes, nothing is as durable as it used to be. More plastic parts are being used and companies just don't make money on things that last forever. I have a garden hose that is easily over 20 years old. I live in a hot climate and it doesn't get stored inside over the winter and I only replaced one end because the threads wore out. I know I'll never find another to last that long again."

"An engineerü__s confirmation should cost ~$500. Since this was an unpermitted remodel, an engineers stamped confirmation is the end all be all. Although the architect may be correct, they are not a structural design company and therefore can only advise what they think may be adequate. In a court of law, what someone thinks may be adequate loses. However, if the architecture firm has in-house structural engineers, or have subcontracted structural engineers who can provide a stamped engineerü__s confirmation, the architecture firm can advise. In that case, the licensed structural engineer should still provide a stamp confirmation (drawing or letter) via the architect. If thatü__s provided, a second engineering companyü__s review is typically not warranted and a waste of money. When youü__re in an unpermitted remodel dispute, you should do everything by the books to document the corrections. Anything less can bring LOTS of problems. If the building department gets involved, the will want a licensed engineers stamped certification. "
"I havenü__t done it but read a lot about it. They really havenü__t started producing solar tiles in their Buffalo gigafactory yet. Additionally there is an extreme shortage of the powerwalls that they are producing in their nevada gigafactory.From what I understand they are starting to produce it but there will be a major waiting list. The tiles are supposed to last 30 years, but canü__t really say that for sure yet, as I believe they are still testing them. Lastly the price is cost prohibitive at this point. I mean weü__re talking $60k+ at a minimum. Now it would save you your energy bills and if you have an electric car you can charge your car at home at no cost. So you have to ask yourself, financially does that make sense. Full disclosure Iü__m a big Tesla fan and want to one day have a solar roof that completely powers my home and car...but to me itü__s not economically feasible and still very early to tell if itü__s truly effective. Plus realistically, if you need a roof soon, youü__re gonna have to wait at least a year. "
"I've been watching thermostats a lot lately.It's important to note that if you only have hydronic heat, you may not have a C-wire, which most wifi thermostats require.  If you don't have that and only have R(h) and W, you're going to have to run a new wire or plug the thermostat into a 24V power supply.That said, Nest is only the most popular wireless thermometer.  There's the Ecobee, too.  Honeywell makes a well-reviewed model that's very cheap.  Emerson as well.  Lux makes one that doesn't require a C-wire but can run off Lithium AA batteries (make sure they are lithium or you'll be replacing them weekly)...but that one gets very mixed reviews.I've also been looking into the idea of going hardcore DIY and doing it from Raspberry Pi's, completely wirelessly.  There's write-ups on that all over the internet.  These probably give the most customibility since you're running Linux and have full access to the system.  Assuming you know what you're doing, the possibilities are limited only by your HVAC system and your imagination.  "
"Painter's tape is bullshit. Don't rely on it to get clean lines. Learn how to cut in with a 3' angled brush.Paint your baseboard and trim first. Then the ceiling. Its harder to cut in. Then the walls. Use 1/2"" or 5/8"" depending on how heavy the texture is. Prime everything that hasn't been painted before. Pain+primer in one is bullshit; its good for hiding stains, not good at actual priming - they just use more pigment in the base. Edging tools are a gimmicky waste of money.Box your paint. Get a roller grid. Get an expensive roller and more expensive brushes. And a telescoping roller handle. Fresh texture is going to absolutely suck down the first coat. Work in one direction. It doesn't matter which, just pick one. Point the elbow of the roller the direction you're working. First coat, get about two widths before wetting the roller. Second coat, three widths. If you have to PUSH the roller into the wall to get paint, your roller is dry. This will cause lines. Don't try to ""make paint last"", it'll look shit. "
"Unfortunately, it's not a system, it's just life. If we lived out in a remote rural area of a third world country, we'd have to be working from sun up until sun down on a farm so that we can grow food, and we'd have to spend weeks chopping wood if we wanted to keep from freezing in the winter. I'm sure we'd get sick of that life too, and dream about a world with grocery stores where all the food is just waiting there for you.The society that we've created helps us in some ways. We won't starve to death because a locust swarm destroyed our farm, or freeze because there was no firewood. But we do have plenty of issues that come with our society that are just a little further removed than the issues facing a more remote civilization. Every person needs food and shelter somehow, whether they built a cabin and a farm, or rent an apartment and work a 9 to 5.That said, you dont always have to be an employee. If you have a skillset, you can find a way to be independant and self employed. It comes with certain freedoms but also drawbacks."
"Tile. Jesus. Well, here goes nothing:Tear out the baseboard and bleach the fuck out of that floor. I mean flood that room and let it sit. If that works, replace with brand new base after the bleach has dried. If you don't like bleach you can use Clorox Urine Remover. It fizzes and foams when it contacts urine/stink particles so you know it's working. I love that stuff. If that doesn't work, adios tile! At least, adios grout. It could very well be that the urine has settled in the grout and is just stinking up your cozy cabana. Your option is to grind out all the grout and that will suuuu-uuuck. But, grout is porous and it lets liquids work through it and under the tile, so if the urine has permeated the grout and penetrated the mortar, adios tile! And then you have whatever is underneath the tile. OSB? Concrete? Who knows! You're going to be replacing, treating, sanding, grinding, whatever else you have to do to get to a non-urinated surface even if that means tearing out everything down to the soil. So, yes, replacing subfloor is your last option, but you have to think of it like a layer cake. Except the bottom layer is urine and backbreaking labor and $$$ so just work your way down.

"People like getting something for nothing and the reason really crappy contractors are around is because of that.    What surprises me is that people expect to get something other that what OP got but for paying less and for not asking around about the contractor before hand.    Good contractors have good reputations. Great contractors have great reputations. The rest though are the majority because they are the only ones capable of doing cheap jobs with no fucks given. Better contractors couldn't do that and sleep at night. They also can't do it on charity and have to charge for it. For the time and effort it took them to get a better education and depth of knowledge to be able to audible when little to very large problems pop up. For the time and effort it takes to surround themselves with others who know the score and what's at stake if they feck up.    And for weeding out the people like OP who the fly-by-nighters absolutely RELY on to make a living......    I agree with u/arizona-lad but I have a sneaking suspicion nothing will come of his advice. People who go cheap on construction and installation rarely find the time and more specifically the money to pay the legal costs to go after the people OP is dealing with. It's another reason there are so many fly-by-nighters around.    And speaking from personal experience, I've never met a rental property who didn't try to get a contractor to bid as low as absolutely possible while turning around and charging as much as absolutley possible to renters. Not a single one ever passes on the savings.    I hope OP is different. I hope most of what he wrote is....less than what he has actually experienced and, deep down OP is concientous and a genuinely stand up individual with a great reputation for looking out for taking care of his renters.    I SINCERELY HOPE that....      He is the exception to the rule of greed and the corruption of money and he isn't actually here to justify greed in an offhanded way.     I hope. I hope. I....know better but still. Do. Genuinely. Hope."

"I always say that ""caulk (silicone here) hideth a multitude of sins."" And again I'll say that I think clear would look best. Clear silicone is not actually crystal clear, in fact it's pretty opaque. It should hide the joint just fine and won't stand out like grey could potentially."

I used 2x4s.  Based on the other comments here I think the best option for me is to put a foam board first and seal that and then rock wool and since it wouldnü__t be 2ü_ù thick foam board I would still need a vapour barrier and then drywall. And I wonü__t have to worry about much.

I'm not a plumber but that air admittance valve looks like it's installed wrong with the sanitary tee backwards like that. Should probably be a wye + 1/8 elbow and installed the other direction. Also do you even need the air admittance valve when you are so close to the vent stack?
I'm not sure where you're located but in NY State they offer an income based program called Empower. If you're approved all work is paid for by the grant. It costs nothing out of pocket. They do a very thorough assessment and will insulate and seal gaps. It makes a huge difference.

Just examined a bit more to track the cold air and pulled off this very thin cover revealing wiring and some pipe. https://imgur.com/a/wG38Hae Iü__m guessing I wouldnü__t want to spray foam all this and would be better with stuffing insulation in? The draft is coming from bottom up

"Thanks a lot for your advice. I'll check at the local Habitat and see what they have. I can see now that the flush bolts are in the astragal itself instead of the door, and the same appears true for the strikeplates in the middle. There aren't any cuts in the actual door, it seems."
"Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it! I got a verbal from him before submitting and he went back on his word and I didn't get the permit so go figure! I could bitch about the whole situation till the cows come home but I like to not put people to sleep talking about it lol"
"Thanks, I also thought about using that method. In my case, the brackets will cost me about $25 extra bucks on a 80 ft fence, and I dont find them unsightly. I don't feel that they are necessarily necessary, but in case of a post or run failure, I like the idea of replacement ease."
"Thanks, I was assuming fender washer would be best to spread the squish out and avoid damaging the woodI'm kind of figuring out now the reason I couldn't find any good info on it is because it's kind of like ""what oil is the best?"" Everyone has a drastically different opinion lol"
That shower is on it's last gasp of functional use. This looks like a classic example of poor/no waterproofing. The curb is probably soaked and rotted. Recaulking and sealing are not going to do any good.  There is no fix. It's a replace. Pick out a nice tile and order a dumpster. 
"The exhaust vent in the link is for a composition roof. You need one for a metal roof, I assume standing seam. Itü__ll have an adhesive base and room for screws all around. It doesnü__t ü__shingleü_ù like a normal roof jack. You stick it over the hole and screw it down. Thatü__s it"

"What kind of insulation is in your exterior walls? Whenever I would blow in dense packed cellulose in a house where I was also insulating/air sealing an attic, I'd skip air sealing top plates of the exterior walls, because dense packed cellulose is virtually an air barrier already."
"What you do now is nothing. Don't touch them for a month. Then you see what you're dealing with and act accordingly,  after researching.Why didn't you do the research on how to paint new plaster? That was sloppy. You needed to let it cure, then prime with oil primer, then paint. "
"Yeah that's the stuff i meant. Consider scooping it out into a bag or whatever, but keep it. Please the stuff in the garage or something and give it a couple days.  If there smell in the house goes down, buy new stuff and toss the old outIf the smell didn't go down, then i dunno."
"Yep, the manufacturer provides a chart with sq ft and corresponding size of the heater you should use, however it doesn't take into consideration that I have 12ft ceilings and windows on three sides, but it's just a bonus room, so I'm not super worried.  The room is about 300 sqft."

"&gt; And in my city it's illegal for homeowners to do plumbing work like that because there is risk of contaminating the water supply for millions of people, and that would be bad.Your city should be using backflow preventers on the service line tap.  They use them here to prevent any possible inflow from customer service lines.  They test them every year in commercial buildings, but also every 2 to 3 years in residential places.  I have a tag hanging on my water meter in my basement which shows the last test and that it passed.  "
"Absolutely! As long as there's no white ant, rot or fungus(?) you're good to go! Get under the house if you can and have a look from there too.Filling those gaps between the boards might be an adventure though. I can't see any fixings so if it's not secret nailed or glued to the joists you might be able to put a pinch bar down the edge of the room and scooch them over to close the gaps? Otherwise some fibreglass resin to fill. Would cost a lot more if you're doing a huge area but is my only other suggestion for a desirable finish."
"For that to work, the cement board cannot be buried in the mud as cement board is not waterproof and will wick water. See  [capillary action](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/capillaryaction.html) . There are visible nails (dark dots) below 6"" in your photos, the corner where the hob (I believe curb is term used in USA) is visible and different to see how the liner has been folded up, and the cbu nailed through the pan liner on the top of the curb kinda makes this whole point moot.Do you have any photos before the cement board went up? "
I added some wider shots in my post.  These are box gutters that run to that outlet which then had a downspout attached. I don't currently have a ladder to get access to the top but I can barely reach the old outlet itself from the stairs. Does the outlet have to be removed from the top of the gutter? I might be able to get on the roof and carefully do that (or get someone who is better on roofs than I am). How would I remove it and install a new one? Are there screws? Wouldn't that make it leaky?  Sorry if these are dumb questions.
"Sorry, just finished up for the day. Anything drywall is ridiculously messy, one of the messier  trades by far hahahaha. You honestly may be able to pull it off! Iü__ve seen some homeowners that had skills good enough to get hired by me hahaha. Your location from what I know via online trade forums would have an affordable price range similar to here which is sweet. And no problem! I hope things turn out well for you! Also that oddly enough does look like primer in some spots or possible wallpaper backing of some sort? No idea lol. "
The bank I used offered a 203k-like loan that wasn't 203k. Only used that to have a garage built (added $25k to mortgage total). Work had to be done by licensed and insured company but I chose them. I also put down only 5% so I had cash to start renovations. Down side is I'm paying PMI but it's really not much. I'll have that dropped soon because the house is worth way more than what I owe. Once most of the cash I had saved was gone we started doing projects as they could be afforded. When you're DIYing things go pretty slow anyway.
"You can use an air gun. Use like an 18 gauge finish nailer with 2"" brads. You dont shoot them in straight. You hold the panel in place and shoot nails through it onbthe edges with the gun at a 45Ùõ angle. This will pin the board to the sheetrock while it has more surface in the sheetrock. Nails that go straight in come straight out, right? But nails that are driven in at various angles are damn near impossible to get out. So if you put 8 brads in a panel at 4 different angles in theory it will not simply pull away easily. Good luck."
"&gt; I would say its very likely a permit is needed.That depends a lot on whether it is in a city or not.  For much of the US there is little regulation for such things at the county or state level.&gt; the plumbing situation, the homeowner may not even be allowed to pull the permitI'm sure that is true somewhere, but it is *very* uncommon in the US for one to be prohibited from doing work on your own residence if you own it and it isn't also used for commercial purposes (e.g. residing in one unit of an apartment structure that you own.)Is there really a place that allows home owners to do electrical but not plumbing?  I'd expect it to be the other way around if anything.  Messing up plumbing typically only damages your own property.  A fire can damage neighboring buildings."
"To match the color of the paint, you're going to need (sadly) to peel off another paint chip from somewhere and take it to get matched.  Paint matching is very good these days, just make sure your sample is roughly the size of a quarter or larger.Homedepot, Lowe's, Sherwin Williams, etc. all do this type of matching, and will sell you a small quantity of the matched paint.  I suggest a ""real"" paint store like Sherwin Williams.I would suggest taking a paint chip from an inconspicuous area, like the inside of a closet or behind a painting that's hanging on the wall.  To get a good paint chip, get a utility knife and a very shallow cut (just through the paint), make a square, and wiggle the knife blade underneath the paint and pull it off carefully.You'll repair both the same way."

"First things first, get rid of any topsoil. DOT Mix covers many things depending on what state you are in, it's a generic term. Start off with 4 LIMESTONE, 1 1/2-2ü_ù clean crushed limestone. Then top it with 6-8 inches of 617, 3/4 to dust. Sometimes referred to as DOT mix, Sometimes DOT Mix is a mixture of 617 and other materials. Check with your local limestone supplier for materials, they can probably recommend a local driver to deliver it. DO NOT just fill with 617 or  DOT mix. First, it will be expensive. A ton of #4 stone will cover around 45 square feet @ 4 inches. That same area will take around 1.4 tons of 617.Second,  617 will sink if it gets wet under them. Example, my driveway is 16 inches of #4 topped with 6 inches of 617. I routinely park my loaded quad axle dump on it. It never moves. There's 24 X 45 foot area that I park my 14,000# fifth wheel camper on, it's 12 inches of 617's that I had stockpiled at home. It makes tracks every time I pull it in and out. I figured that thick it would never move, I was wrong. "
"What's your goal in ""soundproofing""?The HVAC ducts running in the ceiling of the basement won't be notably louder than running in the floor of the upper floor.If your concern is sound transfer between floors--like footsteps and whatnot--then mostly it's just a fact of life in a multi-story house. And the best ways to deal with it involve the upper floor (rugs) not the lower floor. You could hang the ceiling drywall on a resilient channel in the basement, but that eats an inch or so and has a lot of question marks about its efficacy.If you're talking about punching HVAC registers into the branches that already feed the upstairs, then, yes, that'll be a clear sound pathway. You could run different branches to the main trunk in different joist bays. One advantage this would have is that you could put in-line dampers on them to control flow independently. But at that point you're getting into some technical HVAC stuff and it would be worth having someone in the house to look at it. There's a surprising amount of math in HVAC design."
"Thank you.  First off, asking the question is appreciated.  No.  For the most point, we are doing a job that we will be compensated for.  But, let us play with your dogs, let your cat's fuck with us.  Be nice.  We are not your servant, treat us that way and there would be nothing you could do to appreciate our good work.  I'm an electrician, but I've spent a good amount of time with painters.  First thing, it's taught me that I am not a painter.  I have a lot of respect for their skill.

I am so impressed by their skill more often than not.The best way to please a person is through their stomach.  I am also a General Manager with a Contract Services Company.

"Use the continuity setting of a digital multimeter _(beeps when there is a closed circuit between the leads)_ or the resistance setting _(registers finite resistance if the circuit is closed between the leads)_.Ensure none of them are energized.  Downstairs, number each cable jacket uniquely _(e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5)_.  Wire nut the black of 1 to the black of 2; cap off the white of 1.  Wire nut the white of 2 to the white of 3; cap off the black of 3.  Wire nut the black of 4 to the white of 4.  Cap off the black and white of 5 separately.Go to the other end, and start testing.  Ensure nothing is energized and also not touching anything.  Put one of the leads on any white wire, then put the other lead on each other wire in succession.  If the DMM doesn't beep, you have identified that initial white wire as half of 1 or of 5.  If it beeps with a black wire, you've identified all of 4.  If it beeps with a white wire, you've identified half of 2 &amp; 3.Repeat that with a black wire.  If it doesn't beep, you've identified half of 3 or all of 5.  If it beeps with a white wire, you've identified all of 4.  If it beeps with another black, it is half of 1 &amp; 2.Since each pair is coupled in a jacket, and each pair is uniquely ""coded"", you need only test 3 wires in one trip to deduce the correct sequence.Alternatively, you can cap off all of them and separately join and test each pair.  That depends on how well you trust your deduction and how much you mind trekking from one end to the other to make those tests._Edit:  Words._"

"  I suspect you can find a used fan for the exact model on Ebay for under $25, possibly with the mounting bracket (at least a decent chance depending on how popular your model is and if the fan is shared among other models). You may have to patch it into the existing wiring harness."
" Here is a picture of the staircase right now: [https://imgur.com/a/dyGoJnv](https://imgur.com/a/dyGoJnv)&amp;#x200B; If you're wondering what's going on with the walls, there used to be a weird closet. [https://imgur.com/a/ghqEejW](https://imgur.com/a/ghqEejW)&amp;#x200B;"
"&gt; It's not a suggestion, it's from the manufacturer. Just look at the datasheet. Cute, you left out the key word in the quote ""The SharkBite push-fit fittings have been *design* certified...""In other words, they designed them to comply but they are not certified or compliant."
"&gt; Would a dead/dying capacitor in the ceiling fan also explain why it seems to run slower on the same speed as other fans in my home (which are all the same age and model)?Ehhh...&gt; I'd check the fan motor bearing. It maybe going bad causing overload on the fan.Good call."
"Can confirm, my wife can blow dry her hair a little too much and it will set it off, no smoke at all just really hot hair. Itü__s mounted on the ceiling about 3 feet away from the bathroom. Havenü__t had anything wrong yet. I like them so much I started selling them to my customers."
"Cons to not sanding (on smooth surfaces only) is; it's not going to be a smooth evenly ""roller"" textured surface. If you have any type of artificial texture, this will hide minor imperfections in paint application within the textured surface but just make sure the paint is strained."
For quality Iü__d go for a brand like Oras. Even their budget solutions like the [Safira 1022](https://www.oras.com/en/products/oras-safira/product/1022/)  (even though a bit over your budget) are quite food. Of course the more expensive models have more features and fancier design.
"Having the gas turned off is actually a good idea. I pay $16 a month just for the service fee all summer. It's literally the same company as the electric company, so it's not like it costs them $16 a month to read the meter or send me a bill, since they already do that for electric."
I have had both Nest and Ecobee 3 and prefer the Nest. One crucial feature thatü__s missing on the Ecobee is the ability to turn the fan on for a timer. Nest can do it at many intervals. On the Ecobee itü__s either on or off. You have to remember to come back later and turn it off. 
"I just had to do that in the middle of Hurricane Florence. I had thought my cat got out and panicked and shut the door when I shouldnü__t have.Then the little asshole trotted her ass into the kitchen when Iü__m halfway through the window, trying not to knee my husband in the face."
I just took a closer look at my breaker and I do not have an open spot on the panel for a new breaker. That same TOH video mentioned that there are special surge-protector breakers than you can use to replace existing ones to get whole-house coverage. I will have to look into those.
"I know what you are saying but this is actually good advice. There are PLENTY of times that you might be up somewhere hard to get to or just want to double check. I'm not saying to do it in the breaker box. But if you are putting in a light or a flip switch, it's not gonna kill you."

"I'm assuming the computer does all of the regular tinting and the people working there do not have the knowledge necessary to adjust paint colors.What if he added some black to it and it came out way too dark.  Now they have 5 gallons of way too dark gray they probably can't sell."
"Is this a real basement or a crawlspace?  That looks like it's actually a crawlspace vent that they tried to block up when they did the patio... The vent should be above ground level, with the land graded away from it... it's to air pass through the crawlspace and let it dry out. "
"It will be fine, but why not splice in 12/2 and keep the whole line the same to avoid future confusion.  You may find it helpful to have a set of 20 amp outlets on each floor for heavier load things.   These days almost all outlets are 12/2 when possible, and only lighting is 14/2"
"Itü__s dependent on how deep the joists are. If thereü__s enough space to pry up the boards and blow in some cellulose and be good with that then itü__s not a problem. If your dad is pretty handy then a boiler replacement is within his capabilities and it will be around $900-$1000"
"Iü__d go with a expanding foam then wood trim and caulk. If you donü__t have the tools to cut the trim then closed cell expanding foam, then mud it followed by sand and paint. You need to find a way to fill the gap and get a good air seal, itü__s just too big for caulk by itself. "
Iü__ve got a Toro blower/mulcher. They work great! I mulch all my leaves into the shoulder bag and then spread some around the plants and whatever I have left goes into my compost bin or just stays on the lawn. Iü__ve got a 50ü__ ash that drops TONS of leaves as well as a magnolia. 
Iü__ve noticed realtors like inspectors that donü__t find large issues because the realtors want the sale to go through.  Iü__ve hired inspectors on two purchases and regret both.  They missed everything big and only pointed out unimportant obvious things like no GFCI by the sink.  
"Like others have said, just don't let the kid eat it. If you're worried, you can have a blood test done to check her lead levels, but you're probably fine. In addition, eat a healthy balanced diet with plenty of leafy greens and whatever lead exposure will be partially counteracted."
"More than likely mold. Nuke it with bleach and enjoy college. If youü__re super concerned you can always roll $15 of kilz on the ceiling &amp; walls. The whole room will be white but you can get away with a year or two of renting just fine. No doubt this post will get downvotes "
"My opinion is look online at Topp industries. They have drawings of installations based on basin sizes. Check to see if they have a vent installed and what size depending on what you need. I am not advertising them I just use their website for information regarding installations. "
"Neutral cure sticks a little better, takes longer to go off. Is slightly more mould resistant. You still need to make sure to fully clean and dry the joint. Never silicone over silicone, it does not stick. Caulk and silicone are different products, siliconised caulk is not silicone "
"No. But if you have handset locks as well as deadbolts, which is typical of newer homes, you would naturally rekey both. Makes it easy to get to 14 cylinders pretty fast, which if I recall was pretty closely related to the question. 14 exterior doors is a lot, 7 is easier to get to."
"Not a pro, but I'm thinking a trench, not French, drain across the low spot, which directs water into your yard to leech out. Or directly into the sewer, if possible. Kinda surprised this wasn't done at the get go for all those driveways, given that's how they were clearly designed."
"Not sure what you have for big box store options over there. At home Depot you can pick up a decent solid core for $100. Nothing fancy, but looks good and does an amazing job of blocking sound. Don't forget to seal the gap around the frame. Anywhere there is air is a sound pathway"
Of course not. But the expectation that I work for free is. I also used to be a graphic designer. Same thing. ü__Do it for the exposureü_ù ü__do it because youü__ll make a commission on the next saleü_ù no thank you. I have just as much right to expect to be paid as a builder does. 
"Oh there are easier ways. But bad DIY has a tendency to come back to bite you. Better to do it right the first time.Fyi, you might consider oil based primer. They do better at dealing, and when I get to bare plaster I personally tend to use the oil. Though it stinks and is a pain."
Ok so I just expanded the rest of the pics and now I'm 100% team pine.  I've been installing and refinishing wood floors for 20+ years.   Fir has a tighter grain but they still both take stain in that discernable manner that the tighter grain formations tend to be lighter in color. 
That bracket might suck for a gate post (especially since you can't anchor it properly).  I'd look at removing the existing post and reinstalling.  You can probably do it without removing the concrete...but even if you have to saw cut the concrete and pour a patch it isn't THAT bad.
"That may be the case, Iü__ve got a few friends that have put them in their kitchens. They used a lot of the colored pigments and paint to make it look like stone counters. I assume that would keep it from yellowing, but not sure if they used some specific epoxy for heavy use or not."
"That's  what I did. House I bought  was built in the 30s. The previous owners were in their 90s and lived there for over 60 years.  The house is old and it needs a lot of work. I had never tackled anything more than doing minor work. You can check my posts for some of my results. "
"That's kind of true, but when you have a bedroom with a connected bathroom for example, the white noise from a 2.0-2.5 sone exhaust fan actually does help to mask the sounds fairly well.  Even having a little white noise makes sounds less noticeable than when a room is dead silent. "
"The discussion can get very animated,  and at times heated. There are situations where pex is clearly advantageous (you know it'll freeze), but otherwise, it ends up being preference.Full disclosure: I tend to land on copper. There are specific situations where I would choose pex."
"The picture is rough, unsure how I would go about fixing it, if I didn't care about how it looked then I might take a piece of plywood and attach it to the door and then fill the hole, but anything you do right there the door will be less sturdy and likely get damaged quickly again."
There is going to be some serious hydrostatic pressure coming down that hill so Iü__ll see that the drain is wrapped in gravel and fabric. Is there a better way to ensure itü__s non-clogging? They have it called out to go to a sump but I donü__t see why it couldnü__t be daylighted. 
"They were all old school curvy handles, which I didnü__t replace. I tried leaving the handles on but it was very time consuming and messy so I ended up unscrewing them, painting, and then screwing them back on. Thankfully they were easy to take on and off with only two screws each. "
"This is why Iü__m hesitant to switch to a hard surface floor from carpet. Carpet makes for a nice quiet comfy home. But Iü__m leaning toward doing it on the first level. The carpet is a pain to keep clean on entry floor. But then again dog will miss it, and the noise ugh canü__t win"
"We hired it out using Amazon Home Services.  It included cleaning both sides of the windows, cleaning the screens and the sill 20 windows for around $200.  We had some problems in scheduling, but the contractor did an excellent job, and I didn't waste an entire day cleaning windows."
"Well if thereü__s rust on it, itü__s steel.  Wear a dust mask at the very least and sand that shit down.  If thereü__s not a ton of it just do it by hand.  Once the rust is gone give it a quick finish sand with #0000 steel wool.  Wipe down to remove dust and youü__re ready to paint."
"Where are you located? Depending on the ambient humidities from season to season, some kind of vapor barrier (or a semi-permeable vapor barrier alternative) would be pretty easy to put up. Would be a one man job to staple it up there and relatively cheap compared to something solid."
Why is there two gfci's under a cabinet in the first place?! The circuit should be protected by a GFCI which would normally be above the counter for usage and access. Are you sure a permit was ever pulled and has it been closed? Also those gfci's are old and probably not to CA code.
"Wow, that is amazing. I've seen lots of terrible DIY electrical, but I don't even think a child could come up with a plan that bad. The funniest part is that if anyone turns the light off in the laundry room, your garage doors are out of commission at the other end of your property."
"You get a tool out of the deal!  The multi hole jigs are nicer if you're doing lots of work, or working at the bench.  The mini-jig is much more flexible, and lets you drill a pocket hole whereever you damn well want.  Much more useful for construction (as opposed to cabinetry).  "

"I paid $900 for my panel swapout.  I didn't upgrade my service though.  It was just removing my old panel, installing a new panel with new breakers, and cleaning up the wires that were already there.  The guy had to install another ground rod also because I only had one ground and code is now two grounds.The guy should have pulled a permit but he was trying to make more profit off me so he didn't.  He didn't even call the electric company.  He just pulled the meter off to kill power.  So it was a little shady but it's done though."
"I think I understand. So since the ground doesn't carry a current with AC, the ground is a safety feature, which protects the user and device from harm, right? Now when I replace the upstream most receptacle with a GFCI, would myself and the device plugged in (it's a chest freezer btw) be safe in the event of a malfunction? Or at the very least, would the freezer casing still carry voltage in the event of a malfunction if the upstream outlet is GFCI? I apologize if I'm not asking the right questions, I appreciate the clarifications"

"In my home I have a basement and a thick pipe that comes down from the 2 toilets, meeting in a sort of Y with a third branch in the center that vents the sewer up to the roof. When we had the issue you're describing, the clog was in that pipe, and we fixed it by opening a valve in that pipe and running an auger into it. It was a couple baby wipes that had been flushed, got stuck, and accumulated more debris. Running a toilet augur from the toilet did not help in our circumstances, due to the way those 'branches' of the pipe joined."
"Interesting... So say this was done with 8/3 and each of the hots serving a separate outlet. If only a single item was being used, the max amperage would be the same as if 8/2 were used? But if I had two items with that max amperage, they could both be used at the same time, on separate outlets?Would you actually be able to use two items with somewhat higher amperage, since voltage drop would be halved (or at least, the same but split between the two hots)? I'm sure that's against code, just curious from a theoretical perspective. "
"Legitimate contractor here. We keep deposits in a separate account and donü__t transfer it to our expense account until we start incurring project costs.We take a 1/3 down because people are flakes. Hours of time go into the project before we show up. If we donü__t get a deposit itü__s much easier for them to back out weeks down the road and add to an already scheduling nightmare.We have order thousands of dollars in non refundable materials etc.We are legit and well known. I probably wouldnü__t give chuck in a truck a deposit."
"Ok so time to be a detective, check the plumbing while the shower is running , make sure heü__s not chasing his tail on a base leak when it could be a leak at the shower head Connection at the pipe inside the wall dripping down onto the floor . You may need one of those scopes you connect to your phone . If thatü__s dry then tape the drain and pour water from s bucket into the base ( no water on the walls ) let stand for 24 hours After that spray each wall for 20 minutes and observe the floor Good luck and yes fire this handyman . "
"So the leaking is below the threshold or between the door and threshold.For the first case, you could remove the current threshold and buy and install a replacement one. However that is more work and expense. Also may stand out bit. Otherwise I'd do a temporary solution like you mentioned above. Also make sure the concrete outside is sloped away from the house so water doesn't collect up. However this might not be easy to fix.If the second case, get a door sweep. There are a couple different designs depending of how big the gap."
"You can get carpets professionally re stretched after flooding as they will shrink / warp. Absolutely a dehumidifier is a must, get as much ventilation/heat going as you can, open windows and use dryers. Bear in mind water will have seeped in between floorboards and into any floor cavities.  You may need to take floorboards up. Oh and if you have any electrics running near the floor get them checked!  Insurance companies (uk not sure about USA) tend to only pay for repainting/wall paper replacement  up to  the water line so mark it. "
"Have you tried running the items through a zip code specific cost estimator to see if the numbers even resemble what the national averages are?  Xactimate? Remodelingexpense.com?  That number seems pretty high to me (with no real information as to what you want done) and I work with a ton of contractors all up and down the east coast repairing, remodeling, and demoing/rebuilding houses. I would assume your cabinets and counter tops are eating up most of that number, but I could be wrong.Also, the fact that you are working with an architect and an interior designer as you indicated in another comment means you are likely going to be paying at least 25-50% more than what this would have cost just to work with a contractor directly so you have that to take into consideration as well.

"He is not routinely clearing fences, but he does jump quite high and we were warned by the breeder that his father cleared an 8ft. Just trying to be prepared. He will be a hunting dog, and we are doing agility with him. He has a high prey drive and I would prefer to have a fence where I don't have to constantly worry about it. We live out in the country, doggy daycares are about an hour away and I am home all day with him. I understand he is very high energy and needs constant exercise, giving him free roam of the backyard would be great for him. If he's tired, he's less likely to try to figure out how to get over something, right? Of course we will train him and continue to make sure he is getting enough physical and mental exercise, but I'd still like to have a fence I could trust."
"Iü__ve been in a similar situation recently. Been feeling tired and beat down by the labors of my construction/remodeling job. Long term, I might suggest doing like I have done and finding a similar but different career path (for me it is moving out of the field and into project management).

"Left side: 10-2 UF-B copper wire inside 1/2"" conduit + poly pull line^^ this is against code, and generally a miserable choice.   10-2 uf-b wont even fit inside half inch conduit (minimum would be 1 inch), and is just miserable to pull due to the heavy sheathing.  Also, you cant run romex inside conduit, you have to run individual appropriately rated wires per code.   I recommend upsizing all your conduit to 1 inch, going with individual wires (id go to 8 as well, and pull 4 wire so you can do a MWBC later if you like), 10-2 is only gonna support maybe 30a at that distance, you have to consider voltage drop), and put a panel in the barn and run 220v from the main box.  Middle is good.Right is good, although for burial you want to ensure your pex is ground rated.  Most isnt.   "
"Looks like they ran a cat5e to that box. The colors match, but I don't see any twists. You'll need to pull a bit of cable out of the wall, or find that cable in the basement and see if anything is written on it.They then split it so the blue pair is for one phone line and the orange for a 2nd line.I suspect if you go into the basement, you'll find that same splitting done, connected to the incoming phone lines in the house.Check if it's really cat5e (the twists are important), then get a couple surface mount boxes and follow the color code for 565B wiring.https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Surface-Mount-Single-107090/dp/B005E2Y9RYThat box requires a tool. They also make tool-less boxes, but if you're doing a few cables, you'll want the punch down tool, they're pretty cheap."
"That's a toggle bolt.If you go back to Home Depot and look in the fasteners aisle there should be a whole section of nothing but different types of wall anchors. The boxes will have the weight ratings on them. You can also [look online](https://www.homedepot.com/s/wall%2520anchors?NCNI-5). By taking the weight of the thing you are hanging and dividing it by the weight rating of the things you are hanging it with, you can determine how many anchors you need.EDIT: I hadn't looked at what you were hanging before. I wouldn't use wall anchors for something with swinging doors because the motion will eventually make them fail. I'd mount that through the drywall and into the studs.EDIT 2: How about instead of downvoting my post you tell me what exactly it is that you think I got wrong?"
"We purchased a washer and dryer  from sears a few years ago. When they installed the washer they nicked the water line which broke before I had even used it once, this flooded my basement because we were out of town. When we called their customer service I reached some one from India who was no help what so ever and we got the run around. I finally contacted my insurance who had to do legal stuff (I dont know the exact details as I don't know the technical jargon) to get sears to cover the damages.  After that fiasco was completed they replaced only my washer not my dryer that was sitting in the water. Only to have my new washer shock me due to a ground inside the unit being installed in correctly.I will NEVER buy from Sears again. And have only gone to specialty stores after that. "
"You need a junction box in the basement where you can attach a transformer. If you've got an exposed metal junction box you can tap into that's handy, otherwise you'll have to install a new one and tap off a nearby outlet.Then you figure out where you want the chime. Then drill or cut a hole in the plaster and fish your doorbell wire down, through the blocking (may need a long flex bit) into your basement and over to the transformer. Then run wire over to below your front door. Drill a hole along the door and fish the wire. You might consider pulling the trim on one side of the door to make it easy. Then consult wiring diagrams to hook it up.Or use one of the wireless systems and be done in 10 minutes :) of course if you want one of the video doorbells you may be stuck wiring it. "
"well if its a dimmer switch, that is normal but that doesn't seem to be the case. Heat in electricity is generated by resistance in the line/load. Looks like them innerds are falling apart, corroding or in general just getting nasty.  On another thought you should try to get the breaker to trip on that line, scariest thing here is that the line is over-amperage(you said HOT, not WARM)  generally &gt;15 amps depending on the circuit should trip it so you don't get the HOT  and if the breaker is bad you get tots pixies on that line that you shouldn't. Check that the breaker can be tripped first and is working.  Seems like updating the switches wouldn't be a bad idea a 15 pack of rockers is like 10 bucks. ALSO Do I need to switch them?IS A GREAT PUN THAT I WILL NOT LET GO UNNOTICED!"
"I'm not a plumber but have dealt with lots of pluming related problems and also have a well line here albeit much newer.  If it's just ""damp"" then it's probably just because well water is just really cold and you can get by with a dehumidifier.  It looks as though that pipe has been repaired before, the wall has been painted which I'd guess for waterproofing and that patch job looks like it's been worked over several times (not blaming you!). I would really call a plumber for this.  If it's a good amount of water, like visible drips on the wall, you're going to want to stop that from the outside, not the inside.  Since it's block, I'm guessing there's a big enough chunk cut open on the outside (for the well pipe), the block filled with dirt/sediment over time and it's now coming in through the other side of the opening for that well pipe.  That's a guess and is why I stand strong on deferring this to a plumber :)  Considering the picture and the description, I personally wouldn't let this go on considering the structural implications. "
"If the water only drops an inch when it runs, then you have either some _serious_ inflow, or something else is wrong.Try bypassing the switch (unplug pump from switch and plug into outlet) and see if you can drain the pit dry by letting the pump run continuously for a few minutes.  This will not hurt the pump in any way, it's going to be happier staying running than short cycling. If you can drain the pit this way (listen for the sucking sound, if you can't see) then time the refill rate (plug the float switch back in and see how long it takes until it runs).  If you can't drain the pit this way, you need to check grading and drainage around your house, because you have hundreds of gallons of inflow each hour.  Or else your pump is spinning but not moving much water.  Or, as others have said, your check valve is bad and it's filling itself back up.  I finally invested in one of the check valves with the [clear part](https://www.amazon.com/Zoeller-30-0041-2-Port-Check-Valve/dp/B004XBRIHA/), it was one of the best decisions I made."
"So youü__re not wrong, and in some sense I agree with you, but not completely.  If you need help, hire it.  There are plenty of people that need the money to feed their families and make ends meet.  And this is where I disagree with you.  We should consider ourselves lucky that we won the world birth lottery in the sense that you (most likely) and I are not going hungry.  We were born into first world nations and have the ability to get a job and earn money.  A drought wonü__t kill us.   A lion wonü__t eat our family.  A flood or fire generally donü__t mean we watch our family starve like it would have been hundreds of years ago.  Our healthcare, while plagued with problems, is a million times better than it was even 100 years ago.  You should expect to live to 85+ rather than 60.  There are many things to be thankful for in this sea of terrible news we constantly hear.You arenü__t wrong in what you are saying though, you wonü__t feel this way about your job if you are doing something you are passionate about.  Start pursuing that."
"You could add a second layer of drywall over the existing wall, separated with a layer of green glue. That is used in recording studios, but it shouldn't be too difficult for any drywall contractor to do (although it's unlikely they will have any experience installing this way). This will be easiest if there's nothing attached to the wall (cabinets, etc.)You could also build a separate wall just in front of, but not touching the existing wall. That will decrease your square footage and could be difficult if there's plumbing or electric in the wall.You could also get cellulose insulation blown into the wall, as long as there's no active knob and tube wiring. This is probably the least intrusive option.You'll never stop all the noise, but it shouldn't be hard to improve on what you have, if you don't mind spending some money on it. Figure out how much you're willing to spend on the noise problem, and call a drywall contractor and see if they'll give you at least a rough order of magnitude estimate for another layer with green glue."
I was just at a job yesterday where the customer was doing 2 wolf 36ü_ù side by side ranges.  One was all gas and one was a dual fuel range.  The 2 ranges though same brand do not match.  Door depth handle depth and front panel styling may be different.  So be sure you design it with matching ovens if possible.  A few years down the road when one breaks and is not repairable you will need to buy 2 new ovens to keep them matching or the other one will break a couple years later and continually be mismatched.  If the power is existing it may not be bough for both (depending on dual fuel or all gas or all electric models). You could do a 60ü_ù hood (expensive) or 2 30ü_ù hoods or even a big custom box with 2 30ü_ù hood inserts.  2 separate hoods will need 2 separate ducts (might be a huge pain).   The big question is why you want to do this.  Do you want more cooking surface or more oven space.  You can do a single range but add a second wall oven if you need more oven space.  Do a 48ü_ù range top with a single oven.  36ü_ù cooktop with a single oven under it.  The possibilities are endless.  You could also add a drop down door speed oven (combo micro/convection oven) to get a little more oven space and a single 30ü_ù range.  You can get a 30ü_ù range with a split oven that can be a whole oven or be divided into a double oven when needed. (Samsung makes these). There are some like jenn air that have a full oven and the drawer below is also a full temp short height oven (not just a warming drawer).  If you have any questions feel free to ask
"Thank you for your advice.Building department wants an architectü__s plans or a structural engineerü__s report, as long as they are licensed in New York. At first management for the Corporation insisted that this was my problem to fix. I consulted the attorney who helped me on the closing. He told me this is a structural problem and is the responsibility of the Corporation since the Corporation approved of and allowed the load bearing wall to be removed. After I gave the Corporation a letter from the attorney they changed their tune about a day later. Possibly they went to their lawyers and they agreed with the opinion of my lawyer.I went back to the architect that drew the plans for the laundry closet renovation that I had done this summer. I thought that would be the easiest way to go about legalizing the renovation that was done in 2006.Thereü__s a pattern of negligence displayed by the co-op. I want to say thereü__s about 500 apartments on 40 acres. All two and three story garden style apartments. Many of the duplex apartments have had washers and dryers installed inside of bedroom closets. When I had the home inspection before the sale the inspector questioned this. I was assured by the co-op and seller that ü__all renovations were done by licensed contractors.ü_ù I was shown the license and plans that the co-op had for the wall removal, washer and dryer.When I went to the building department before I wanted to take the laundry machines out of a bedroom I discovered that this renovation from 2006 was never properly permitted by the town. The co-op has agreed to pay for the contractor to legalize the wall removal and also to reimburse me for the architect. I think that after getting a quote from their contractor to replace the header the Corporation wants a second opinion."

"A tester would tell you very quickly which one is was. Iü__ve fixed a whole lot of water heaters. Itü__s almost always the lower one. That said, You should replace both of them at the same time regardless. They are not that expensive so do both. Also you should replace the anode rod."
"Are you renting? If so that could be a problem. But maybe landlord will allow you to mount it? If not the only solution is those picture hanging strips that can hold 30 pounds supposedly. But mirror might be too heavy. You could use a shit ton I suppose....Man are you in a pickle! "
"Are you trying to bring it up to code? Any wall greater than 24"" needs a plug, no more than 6' from a door, no more than 12' between any two. That'd be minimum. If you know how the rooms will be laid out add more according to that. One on either side of bed, plug for desk, tv, etc.. "
"As someone with a cordless, I say go corded. I only bought it because I'm already all-in on the Milwaukee M12 line. It's great for tight spots and quickly cutting down some pipe, etc. And yes, pruning is easy without the cord. But I'm going to have to eventually get a corded, anyway."
"Clean Shower spray.  Use after every time you take a shower.  I spray my glass doors every time and the whole enclosure every other timeWhen you do clean, it's super easy.  I just do some scrubbing bubbles, let sit for a few mins, medium scrubbing with a Magic Eraser, and wash down"
"Flooring usually comes in 20 sf bundles, so you will probably want to get 5 bundles. I think with such a small room you are likely to have more waste than the typical rule of thumb. When you are done make sure you save a few extra boards in case you need to replace one at some point."
"Have you had any moisture problems in the duct? Iü__ve just installed a fan and am considering venting it out the gable end, but itü__s at least 15 feet and Iü__ve been concerned about the length, but  Iü__ve also been quoted &gt;$400 to have someone come out and install a roof vent."
"Honestly, I don't like that. But if it prevents that same thing from happening to more families because they DID follow the codes, then I will accept it. Are you suggesting that because some inspectors aren't so great it's a good reason not to follow the rules for people's safety? "
"How is the attic vented? If there are soffit  vents you need baffles. If its a ridge vent and you have no intention to ever add soffit vents then no.However, if there is not / limited fiberglass insulation now you have already done the hard work. I would go ahead and install them. "
"I have been browsing this sub non-stop about insulation so yeah the air sealing is a top priority.We did contact the gas co about it and I may fall into the category for rebates, not sure. With 2 people in my household we have to make less than 41k I believe. Thanks for responding!"
"I have bought appliances off of craigslist many times with no problems of performance and mostly under 2 years old.  I more recent purchase last year was a built-in oven that to ""buy new"" was $1200 and I found one on craigslist still new in the box for $300 as part of an estate sale."

"I have two boys, 5 and, 7 and we've been in this house for about 8 years now. Previous owners put in new, cheap carpet. Its all but destroyed in the common living areas from daily wear and tear. The occasional stain I take care of with a spotbot, but it really does not standup well. "
"I know they make them because I had an indoor ceiling fan in a previous home that had a heater in it, too. It came with a remote where you could choose the temp, the speed of the fans, and the light dimmer. The thing was amazing. Iü__ll try to remember the brand and get back to you. "
I recently saw [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoK_Of2lK0O/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=inspire_me_home_decor) on Instagram and think its so cool. Its stationary so not exactly what she's looking for but is practical for any space where there are tall shelves or cabinets you want to reach.
"I would get on the phone with a city inspector. Not only will they have the answer, they can see to getting the issue actually fixed... best to do it anonymously, because as you know condo owners are little communities, and whistleblowers who eventually raise HOAs are not well liked."
"I wouldnü__t trust the cabinets to hold a heavy stone countertop. Thereü__s a good chance the cabinets arenü__t secured all that well to the wall. When you start adding all that weight, the cabinets might pull away or worse, collapse under he weight. Get an oversized cutting board?"
"I'll be following this as I'm sort of in the same spot. But here is what I did in the ""meantime"" until I figure it out I hung another shower curtain about $15 for a tension rod and a liner.on the offending wall and that has solved the issue but it's nowhere near a permanent solution."
I've always had a good luck with the freud stuff but i haven't bought any in a couple of years.  I like the irwin marples line for woodworking but not sure if the same features that make a nice blade (you have a forrest you know what I'm talking about) also make it stand up to abuse.
I've honestly never given it much thought - I just grab a brush or roller and get to priming. Some primers (and surfaces) cover very well. Others (like peelstop) are pretty translucent. You're sealing in the surface and prepping for your topcoat - not making it pretty. Happy priming!
"It wouldn't look like that if you regularly cleaned.Watched the news the other day and a tenant was angry at the landlord because she had mold in her bathroom, and thought the news would shame the landlord for her...  Had she cleaned her bathroom there wouldn't have been mold. Smh."
Ive put off buying a Nest for a long time because I questioned their effectiveness over a standard programmable t-stat but this idea makes a lot of sense. I guess the only downside would be is that it'd make the balance of our home A LOT warmer but we can deal with that I do suppose.
"Iü__m considering getting my ducts cleaned, and I was told not to by my sisterü__s father in law who worked in hvac systems his whole life. He said that you only start considering this if a place is 20-30 yrs old and before then itü__s more likely to do more harm than good. Thoughts?"
"Iü__ve had the best luck with a paint edger. My hands shake, so no cutting for me, but I also hate tape. The edger works like a dream and does better edges than anything else Iü__ve done. Itü__s like a plastic rectangle with wheels and a disposable felt-like pad that holds the paint."
"My solution has been to buy about 50% extra of any hardware. Saves me if I drop one and lose it, or find that I need more, or of course finding the occasional wrong threaded bolt/nut in a big bag of them. Now I have some bins at the shop from my leftovers to pick from when needed. "
"No household wiring is done in series. Everything is parallel. If you were to run two appliances in series, then they would not get the voltage they are intended to run on and will be damaged. Not to mention every combination of appliances would change how much voltage each one gets."
On upgrades and rewires my electchicken always pulls new grounded circuits to areas where he anticipates entertainment equipment (bedrooms and living room/family room) in order to provide proper grounding protection and to supply potential cumulative loads for high wattage equipment.
Right. The owner was a doctor and he never repaired  the roof. All the sheet rock is soggy and moldy but I tore it all out. Floors buckled but joists look okay. I have a tarp over it and it rained last night. A few drops of water got in but it's an improvement over what I walked into
Simple test: block off some other rooms and see if the flow increases in rooms you are concerned about. If it doesn't then you have a leak or a blockage. If it does then your blower is not powerful enough or maybe you just need to balance your system i.e. reduce flow to other rooms. 
"Sorry, the plastered walls were dry before painting. I didnü__t make that bit clear! Precisely why Iü__m so annoyed. I research everything first but I was decorating with a relative who said it would be fine. I had assumed that the need to water paint down was purely for coverage. "
Thank you for your post as itü__s very helpful! I did some research and Iü__m thinking of getting the air tested first. I agree with your thought on not cleaning the air duct as it may only make the situation worse. Iü__m going to dig into this more and hopefully have an answer soon!
"Thanks.  Originally I was going to go with something like a sage green, but went a safe route that was bright and would go with the carpet before we end up replacing it.This is my first time buying good paint and I'll never go cheap again!  The coverage on this stuff is astounding!"
"That sounds like it will work, I think I have [a few of these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWCWC9B/ref=twister_B06XG3P5ZC?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and they've worked pretty well for me. I keep one in my sewing kit too on a string for waving around the floor if I drop a needle, lol."
"The dust mask was for the dirty carpet :)  didn't  remove the asbestos tiles at all. There was other absestos that we got professionally removed and I asked them for their opinion,they said to cover it like so and that was fine as long  as we didn't  nail a bunch of holes into it. "
The gear in mine completely wore out down to a rounded ball. The teeth were gone. After a few weeks of just pushing the door up manually my finger got caught in the door and ripped my whole nail off. Almost broke my finger. Bought a gear for $15 and replaced it and now it works fine.
"The service entrance is where the utility enters the house (it's not a door). Usually the utility comes in right at the meter. So look near the meter.I can't imagine a main breaker panel being outside but I suppose in a warm/dry climate it's possible.Attic is definitely possible."
The silicone repair would work best for the type of cracks you describe. The cracks open and close slightly with temperature fluctuations and the silicone will stretch and move with the cracks.   There are silicone that come in different colors that might match your driveway better. 
"They aren't quick. The device itself should be tight but the cap should be a little loose. I would run the boiler for a while and it will force the air out over time. Or just to be safe, replace it.If all else fails, run the system, and open the valve on the return side if you can."
"Us too!! &amp;#x200B;We also keep getting the same check for the previous owner's kid and I've sent it back like 3 times now. I even tried to contact the company (because...check) and they won't tell me anything since the check isn't made out to me. I'm banging my head over here."
"We had four quotes for an extensive Reno on a small kitchen. Redo floor including replacing some sub floor, replace all cabinets, stone surface countertops, in the US and a medium cost of living area. Quotes ranged from $13k for a pure contractor to $21k for a designer/contractor. "
"Well like I said it's hard to see much of anything from a blurry photo. If you draw out which wires come in, how they are connected to the switch, etc. that might make it easier to help. You should be able to look at the back to see the Romex sheathing so you can identify the cables."
"Yes rearranging the tub under the window was my first thought, but the contractor told me it would be costly (plumbing wise moving everything around) and having a shower against the window would create alot of moisture buildup in the wall and eventually down the road create problems "
"Yes, you will need enough switch ports for all the drops you want to run. And yes, you can split them across multiple switches and connect the switches together with single runs of cat6. The traffic between switches would of course be limited to 1Gbps, but for most homes that's fine."
"You can simply turn the mounding upside down against the fence and make one miter cut.  From the looks of the pictures, just a 45 degree cut.  This would mean the fence is the wall and the floor of the saw is the ceiling.  I ended my dining room crown the same way.  It looks great."
You may already be doing this but don't be shy about just diggng the sawzall blade down into the dirt and sweeping it around to cut roots under the dirt.  Also just use a digging bar or a maddock and just keep digging down and cutting any root you encounter. It can be a real pain. :)
[psychrometric chart](http://web.uconn.edu/poultry/NE-127/NewFiles/Psychrometric.html) might give you an idea.  Maybe polyiso insulation outside or cut the concrete near the walls and put polyiso vertically in the dirt.  A physics question about where in materials dew points occur?  
"have rat problem at my house also.  apparently, they are under both my sheds and possibly in the crawl space under my kitchen extension.  traps have worked well but with the cold weather setting in, i might have to wait until spring to flush these fuckers out.  its all out war now..."
"that sucks.. just don't touch it for a few days and see what happens.in flood rehabs sometimes the drywall is left in place if its from a clean water source like a burst pipe in the house.hopefully they didn't force that stuff down into your walls too but .. give it a couple days"
"well, after 8 years, its probably safe to say that you cant just turn on the hose and make it run.  Im sure there is some work to be done.  But its a different level if that work requires a new pump, or if there are broken pipes under the patio or cracks/holes in the pool wall/liner."
"whatever you do, turn the water off at the toilet first   I used this same one.. cool thing on the homedepot site is that it tells you where its at in the store, in the bay area. I had a bad water hammer from my previous one. it took less than 10 mins for me to replace it. good luck!"
"Agreed. Even knowing what I do about the kits, the convenience and ability to do it at my own speed add a nice value to the overall project. On HD's site you can read lots of feedback on the kits, including what you still need to buy, and what elements of the kit just aren't up to snuff. This will give you a much stronger idea of final cost. Pretty much any lumber yard can put a part list together for a shed build and drop the lumber in your driveway for you. It's wise to see what each one does for 'shed kits' as they all vary a bit. "
"Been in your shoes, so here's my 2 cents.First, download a wifi strength analyzer and see where you are having deadzones.  Don't use whatever router your ISP gives you b/c its generally not as good as ones you can buy.  I would upgrade your router regardless tbh.If you only need a single powerline connection, it may work for you, but case by case.  If you need more than 1, forget about it.Best solution is just to wire your house.  It's a pain but it was worth it for me.  It's honestly not rocket science, but a lot of grunt work."
"Can you tell us about the cabinets and or share a picture. If they are a fairly standard finish, you might be able to get a filler strip with a finish that matches well enough - screw that tot he bottom of the cabinet, sticking out the needed distance and screw a scrap of similar thickness where the microwave's back screws go and you're done.But... is that a recirculating hood or does it actually vent to outside?  I had one of those over range microwaves once that just recirculated through a charcoal filter - I don't recommend them."
"I had my roof replaced without the gutters being replaced. They gave the gutters a good blow out after they were done but they left debris clogging a couple downspouts. That was the worst that happened. Otherwise, those old gutters weren't any worse than they were before.  I'd say don't worry about it. The multiple roofers that I got estimates from actually recommended I get the gutters replaced at a later time when I do the siding. Give it a good inspection after they're done and if anything doesn't look right, make them fix it. "
"I saw a guy on youtube who had an early install. He paid an awful lot for it though, and will likely never make any sort of ROI. He was also quite local to the Tesla HQ, meaning he was basically a beta tester and in close proximity for when anything went wrong.I personally I love the idea, but it needs an awful lot more market testing and penetration before I would consider it on my home. Tiles will inevitably fail over time, and is there any guarantee Tesla will still be producing them (in the same design)? I'm not convinced."
"I was thinking about that but since the tile is cut around it sliding the floor underneath just from the carpet side will cause it to be major slanted. Unless you mean lay the laminate underneath all the way to the tile around the supporting core? Also, if I were to do that after reinstalling the base cap the floating floor would be attached to the subfloor by the screws holding the base cap down I believe, or at the least be holding the laminate in place.That stretchy caulk is new to me and might just be what I've been looking for."
"I would personally take care of the plumbing and regrading first.  You don't want to mess with water problems.  Definitely paint before furniture goes in.Refinishing the floors is much more convenient before you move in.  We just got ours done and it was a pain in the ass moving stuff out and not being able to live normally for a week.  Do trim after floors.If everything is functional (except glass door), do whatever you want first.  If having a fenced in yard for your dogs is more important to you than a nice bathroom, go for it."
"If you need the rest of the day, tell him you're feeling very ill and need to go home for the day. You might have fallout, but like previous poster said if you do good work you can find more. Long term, you can think about exactly what you want in work, but for today take a mental health day. If manager guy presses, lie and say you've got some severe GI symptoms kicking in and you don't want to be far from a bathroom. People don't usually like fucking around with GI viruses. Get some rest and re-tackle the problem with a clear head."
"My 1927 house we totally remodeled. I have CAT5 outlets in all rooms, I have a dedicated wire chase from basement to attic where I can pull in any type of wiring needed and I have over the years with DISH and DirectTV coaxial that comes into attic on gable end.  I hate outside cabling.  I installed highly customized landscape lighting with 4 zones of control with custom built relay board and illuminated switch panel. I doubled/tripled the number of outlets in the house, added ""switched outlets"" in each room for floor and table lamps. "
"Personally, I like to draw the eye away from the house. I like native flower beds or bushes or tall grasses at the corners of the road and the driveway, for starters.

"Since the toilet has to come out anyway when he goes to tile under it, why put a new one in now, only to remove it later again?Why not just leave the old toilet in place and pull it out when he's ready to tile under it? Then put the new one in after grouting. Saves you having to remove it twice and it's less likely that the new toilet will get dirty or damaged. FYI - the tile floor will be higher than the existing linoleum, so you'll need some sort of flange extender or spacer to get the toilet flange flush with the new flooring.

"Thank you for you feedback. I will check out the Rigid system. My main concern was the accuracy and ease of use with the fence system so I am glad to hear you've had no issue with a sub $1000 system - this is the type of feedback I was looking for!Also, thank you for the confirmation regarding the routers. I had heard similar things regarding the Bosch vs Porter Cable. Will certainly look into the pony pipe clamps. I  imagine I'll be buying quite a few clamps, so I'll probably try a few different types as I start purchasing them. "
That inspiration sink is gorgeous! It would probably have an adjustable tail piece (the vertical drain pipe before the trap) so that would be one measurement to check. I'd remove the white pvc piece and measure from the center of the black pipe up to where you want the bottom of the sink. You'll also want to make sure the porcelain part of the sink fits above or around the two supply lines. If you find the sink that matches those measurements and you're handy enough to hang a shelf or a picture then you can definitely do it yourself! 
"The bit set for that is $150-200, Relton is a known brand.

The holes are made inside the raised rings. There are three bits for the process:1. Pilot bit, makes starting hole2.

"What pure heart said. Some other things to think about. If you plan on replacing the range anytime soon, that particular style has pretty much been abandoned. You can still find them, but they're expensive. I would suggest removing the cabinet under the range and setting it up for a free standing or slide in range. Also, if you want an over the range microwave, you'll have to do something to raise the cabinets there. As they are you'll have trouble getting a microwave under there, and if you do it's going to crowd your cooking space. "
"XPS is probably cheaper than spray foam, but it's worth getting quotes since it might not be much cheaper.If you need framing and drywall anyway to make a finished space, you might as well insulate between it to reduce the amount of foam needed.I think DensShield actually has a slightly rough surface since it's meant to be a tile backer, so it might not be the best for finished walls. Water resistant drywall would be fine, since you already have framing there's no harm in adding more materials that will be damaged if they get wet."
"It just annoys me.  Of the four contractors, A, B and D are the only ones who have given me written bids.  D has the lowest bid and has been personally recommended by several friends and co-workers after I asked around.  He also won't call me back.  I think A doesn't want the work so he gave me a joke bid.  That leaves me with B by default and he's $1k higher than D's written bid and C's verbal bid but they will also be out pretty quick to do the work I think.  Word on the street is that they also do good work they just charge higher prices for it.  I may end up going with them just because they're the only reasonable ones who will talk to me at this point.  I hate the flakiness here so much.  Would rather go with C or D but if neither will communicate then that's not really an option."
"Ive been in my house for 2.5 years. I didnt start getting mail for other people until around January of this year. Turns out my regular mail man had been sorting the mail and taking them out. Guess when he left the office? The biggest kicker came when i got a package delivered for the former resident. I kept it on my porch for a week just in case they would come and get it. After a week I took it to the post office. The girls boyfriend shows up at like 930 that night looking for the package. He proceeded to get mad at my wife saying we stole the package and this and that. This bitch hadnt lived in the house for at least 2 years at this point but still had a package delivered there. It actually makes me wonder if she has been having other things delivered and gets them before I notice"
"Same thing happened to me after installing beautiful rift and quartered sawn oak floors. 3 easy things resolved the floor swelling and they returned to normal a couple weeks after1) dehumidifier2) Vapor barrier - buy 6mil (min) plastic and lay it down across the ground in your crawl space. Also run it a couple feet up the side walls and piers. Use heavy construction adhesive to hold3) seal off any exterior vents - in essence creating a quarantined environment below your houseThis did the trick for me! With the vents closed year round, my crawl space is bone dry and very cool, even in the summer!Also, make sure your roofline uphill of your crawl space has gutters for proper run off/ irrigation management - donü__t want water from your roof running under your house.Good luck"
"As has been said, remove the asphalt with brute force. I would also rent a concrete saw and cut out a nice full thickness square about two inches larger than the current patch and remove. This could get tricky in the tight spots.Examine the area underneath the old patch. Is there aggregate present?  Did this wash out at some point leaving the concrete above weakened hence the collapse? Generally speaking, this shouldn't happen, so I'm curious as to the cause.&amp;#x200B;That should about cover the demo and investigative part of the process. As for patching, I would ensure that you have several inches of packed stone in the bottom of the resultant hole. You may want to reinforce the new concrete which should be adequately done using wire mesh. anchoring the mesh to the existing concrete would only serve to make this stronger as the joint between the old and new will never be very strong. Note that it shouldn't have to be, but every little bit buys you time. Finally, pour ready mix concrete into the nice square hole and trowel it smooth. As for finishing, and to deal with the spalling in the second pic, you could go with a nice epoxy based garage floor covering. It should level out and fill the holes rather nicely as well as covering the joint where you removed the old sunken spot.  "
"One advantage of a transition is easing repairs if they need to be made in that you can independently pull up the laminate in the one room.  Otherwise, you have to cut it out or 'unwind' it from the last plank placed.  Perhaps the manufacturer does not want to cover that associated cost under warranty (limit the warranty exposure to one room at a time)?I have laminate in adjoining family room and kitchen.  I have a transition between the two rooms in case the kitchen needed replacement (more likely since it is in a potentially wet area -- I took/assumed that risk).  It would be difficult to replace/repair the kitchen flooring otherwise. On the expansion joint, there is typically a piece of plastic that is something of an inverted T shape with a U shaped protrusion for the top (visible) T molding to snap into.  I placed the end of the laminate very close to the U shaped edge on that part (maybe less then 1/8 inch) and in the warmer afternoon the laminate would expand and just touch the vertical edge/side of the U shaped well, causing a squeak when you walked close to the transition.  So you have to keep the edges just a bit back from that part, too (cut it back to about an 1/8th inch and that fixed it).  A downside of transitions is they do seem to be areas more prone to cause squeaks if the floor underneath is not really level and supporting the planks evenly where they meet the transition.  Any small movement induced at the transition from the planks deflecting can cause a squeak between the top T trim and the part it snaps into.  Stepping on them seems to cause a squeak on one of the transitions in our home and not another -- probably less then perfectly flat subfloor under the noisy one (I'll probably end up screwing it down tight rather then just snapping it into the channel).  "

"&gt;What are the safety concerns?[Ozone is a component of smog.](https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution)  It is a highly reactive form of oxygen analagous to hydrogen peroxide. It scorches lung tissue like bleach.  It also oxidizes hoarder poop like bleach. It breaks down naturally after ~24 hours, so it can be safe.For this reason, buying a weak ozone machine and running it while you're home is a terrible idea.  *Rent* a strong one, spend the night at a friend's house, then go in and open the windows, and take it back to the store.

"1. The simplest trick to secure a sliding glass door is to cut a piece of wood or an old broom stick to place next to the sliding door on the track to prevent the door from opening.2. While tempered glass is stronger, it can still break and shatter.  Tempered glass just means when it breaks that it will break in such a way that it won't create sharp spikes that could impale someone.  The annealing process makes the glass stronger.  Having said that, modern sliding glass door glass (anything installed after 1977) is tempered in the US."
"Ah me too! Our inspector said it was the first time duct work actually needed to be cleaned out. They pulled about ten pounds of hair, dust, and... stuff from the ductwork. Plus a couple cans of air freshener, hair brushes, and dolls. We had someone else out to look at our AC, and he said the filter hadnü__t been changed in probably years. The previous owners lived there for ten. The house cooled down by about five degrees after the filter was changed, and another five when the ductwork was clean. I donü__t know how they lived with it."
As an engineer I'd recommend that you start with an architect. Architects can lead the project and engage the appropriate engineering disciplines (structural/electrical/plumbing/HVAC) as needed to produce the construction documents. From there you can bid the drawings if you don't already have a qualified GC in mind and also retain the architect through the construction phase to address any construction concerns. This project seems unique and would require the appropriate design professionals to get involved before construction begins.
"Do be aware that you want to be thoughtful about airsealing and moisture/vapor barriers. A 1900s house was not designed to be airsealed and sealing incautiously can create moisture problems. More insulation will do you a lot of good, but if you put in air/vapor barriers/closed cell foam make sure you are thinking about where condensation might occur and where moisture that enters the building envelope can travel or escape. A good insulation contractor should be able to talk you through this and discuss ways to manage moisture movement."
"Don't paint them they won't look as nice and the paint won't last. We just bought a home where the previous owner painted all the tile in the bathroom and kitchen and it's a damn pain in the ass to remove (plus it looks horrible). Have you looked into having the tiles reglazed?I have no idea if this can be done on floor tiles. If it can, I don't think you should try one of the DIY kits because from what I've read it's difficult to do well.  Hiring a pro could be cheaper than installing new floors depending on how big of an area it is. "

"Can confirm this. Even as a pro, it's not particularly easy to tidily cut out existing tile. Multitools are slow and vibrate like crazy so it's easy for them to initially jump off line. Grinders create an insane amount of dust, and it gets hard to see if you're cutting in a straight line unless you create a guide and somehow manage to secure it in place (thankfully grout and silicone can hide many sins). Given, through subway tile (such as was listed in one of arizona-lad's guide) it's not so bad. This looks like the tile will at least be 4mm (1/8"") thick, if not all the way to 10mm (roughly 3/8"") thick potentially though I'll suspect the former is more likely. So basically, at very least it's thicker and denser than subway tile so it'll be a bit more challenging than that listed guide."
"He said ""only 25% will be able to be salvaged"". It's not as simple as just punching holes where needed. Plaster doesn't behave nicely. You start drilling or cutting, andthe vibrations knock the whole wall off the keys. It's going to look like utter shit if every wall is patched, and if they just drywall over it they're going to have to extend every window and door trim, and it's going to cost more to run the electrical and do any plumbing. I literally just went through this exact situation. We removed  only what we needed to for framing(about 75%) and now here I am a couple months later getting the rest removed. Because it's actually going to save me money on electrical and drywall. I'm in the Midwest too and its pretty cheap to higher a demo crew to handle this work. Totally worth it. "

"I understand how waterproofing works, I was saying that the only way to truly waterproof something is to do what I said, I was not implying that should be done or that it was feasible in an existing case.A french drain is also not waterproofing, it is a step to route water outside of the basement.  The drain is inside the foundation for the basement, and is open to the air.  It's like having an open channel pipe in your basement.  While the basement floor won't be wet, it'll still be a water carrying channel in the basement.  My main point was that you're in groundwater, there is likely little you can do to keep it truly dry down there.  There are steps you can take to mitigate the extent of moisture, but don't expect to have a finished basement with carpet and drywall in the end.  "

"The person who suggests 1"" ply doesn't get delamination. Sharp edge will become ruined in 37 secondsü__poly won't be your savior. Putting a metal strip would protect, but would essentially eliminate the look you were after. Sharp edge threatens achilles tendons going down and toes going up (assuming you have overhang) aside from feeling unnatural to the foot. Plywood is strong ok, but 2x12 flexes less in the dimension needed in this application (and you could even eliminate the riser.) The only possible reason why one might think of plywood is to produce a deeper step, but this effectively achieved by adding 2-by material to the riser side of the tread.

"When we first moved in to our house 15 years ago we had a basketball hoop and two metal clothesline poles by our driveway.

We took the hoop down - including the post that was again in concrete, but just sitting loose in a hole. Apparently the people who lived here before us were more worried about their clothes then they were their children.

"There's a few things to consider here.  First check your fire blocking requirements.  It's very possible that it'll be easier just to install some drywall or lumber above the boards with the foam to begin with.  Secondly I believe most manufacturers advise against leaving the foam directly exposed for too long because it's susceptible to dusting, basically the top of the foam getting powdery and coming off.  That's not going to hurt the side facing the stud wall too much but I wouldn't just leave it sitting stacked for months on end either.  XPS is basically styrofoam and has some flame retardants in it usually, it'll pretty much just melt if exposed to heat, it's actually easier to light wood on fire with a torch than XPS in my experience and I wouldn't view it as much more dangerous than a pile of wood or lumber lying around in all honesty.  The main reason you have to fire block around it has more to do with how easily it melts and it allowing extra air in afterwards to feed the fire than it does with it being dangerously combustible."
"What's wrong with the stairs?  Are they just aged and a refresh (stain or paint)?  Are they soft/rotted and need replaced?  Are the foundations okay?  While your authority may be different, typically for minor maintenance and repairs (including re-decking) you don't need a permit.  That means even if they don't meet current code, you don't need to bring them up to code if (and only if) you are doing like-kind maintenance.  For example, if you decide to replace the treads and you replace them with 36"" wide treads with the same cross-section as the existing treads, that's maintenance.  No permit.  No code upgrades required.If you want to reconfigure the stairs, or change anything about them, you'll likely need a permit and the entire staircase will need to be brought up to current code.To your question, if you're simply replacing the treads, if you have any minor carpentry skills, you can easily replace the treads.  Honestly, same for the stringers.  Depending on the age, you may have a bear of a time backing out the old fasteners.  "
"I actually really like the look of your house -- it's like a blank canvas, and I really like the straight lines!This is probably what I'd do:1. Add medium/dark stone to the front entry way, where the white siding exists2. Change the color of the existing stone to a medium/dark stone (I would probably keep the stone sill in the garage-level window the current color for now)3. Change out the outdated:   1. Front porch light   2. Gold kick plate   3. Gold door knob4. Change the garage door to something more modern5. Add landscaping -- considering something like a raised flower bed for beneath the main window as well, to add dimension, or various height flowers or bushes.6. Remove that giant bush to the left of your house (I personally just hate those, and think it takes away from your house)Then, I'd take a step back and look for the next phase of change. This could include new siding, adding a porch, changing the walkway, front door, etc. I think with landscaping though, and some minor cosmetic changes, the look will be drastically different and you might be able to wait on the more costly changes.Honestly, the house just looks a little dated &amp; ""builder"" quality with some of the choices -- many of them are easily rectified with a little hard work, and not a ton of money."
"I have a funny story on that.We used to live in the great white north, where cold is an entirely different level.  One morning, the power was out when my wife woke at 5am to pee.

It got frost inside it that built up over winter, and eventually shorted the internals of the socket.  Apparently, it spit out a bunch of sparks each time I flipped the main, and caught the drapes in front of it on fire.  The fire didn't catch, and we just had a small smokey mess, but man... that could have been nasty.  Every time something weird happens power wise, I get my wife on the phone while I flip breakers.

"In all my research, this seems to be the current best practice.Only change I'd make to the plan is to increase the xps width to be up to 2"" to ensure you have an adequate thermal break, otherwise condensation might occur on the interior surface of the foam when it gets really cold."
"In the meantime, you can crush ice in a blender, with a food processor, or by putting ice inside a tea towel (on a cutting board) and smashing it with a cast iron skillet, kitchen mallot, or a clean hammer. As a crushed ice fiend, Vitamix &amp; Blendtec blenders produce great results! "
"Is the window recessed enough to fit a sheet of acrylic in the opening and caulk the edges of that? Less linear feet, easier to remove.I have a bathroom with a wood double hung window in the shower. I bought a spring curtain rod and cut down an opaque shower curtain. Cheap and easy. "
Iü__d just paint it and put a piece of this [PVC Shelf Edging](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/p.pvc-shelf-edging-white-12-in-x-8-ft.1000143095.html) on it considering you already have it built. Cheap and easy. If a few years down the road it swells up you can rebuild out of plywood. 
"Look at luxury vinyl planks. Easy on the budget, easy to install.  100% waterproof; cannot support mold or mildew. The higher end versions (Lifeproof from Home Depot) have a built in underlayment that provides a degree of cushioning.Kid and pet friendly, it holds up to tons of abuse."
"Lots of people recommend plumbing showrooms, but I shopped around the showrooms and found they sold the same part numbers as elsewhere but much more expensive. Reality is you can get good faucets from the big box stores, but you're looking at $200 minimum for something that isn't junk."
"My building was about $12,000 and another $3,000 for the concrete work.  They were running a special that included free insulation.  I did the wiring myself.  After it was in place, I spent about $1,000 on 5/16th OSB for the walls and ceilings and made it into a pretty cozy workshop.  "
"Parts of it are still slightly damp. I changed the towel this morning, but the spots away from my windows. Just let it finish air drying and still nothing to worry about?I haven't had carpet in 12 years and people say any moisture can cause mold or mildew, which is why I'm so anxious"
"Poor insulation if sheetrock on furring strips.  The furring strips only allow 3/4"" foam sheets for insulation.  The blocks might also have vermiculite or something similar poured into the block cells.  This does nothing because there is so much thermal bridging through the block webs."
"Rope light might actually work. Yeah, these are 5 separate units in different places, but 4 out of the 5 have an outlet behind or next to them. Xmas lights won't give enough light and will look too busy. But a continuous wrap around of rope light might work, I'll play with that... hmm."
"Rough ballpark on pricing for their three and four panels? Would you go 72"" or 90"" height? I have a ~13' wall between my dining room and deck and am looking at replacing a single door to let a lot more light in. It looks like I may be able to manage the 4 panel with an engineered beam."
"Running a home run PEX line back to a manifold will help curtail the problem. It's probably just the showers you really care about, so if you just do those you'll have a pretty good cost/benefit situation.It won't totally eliminate it if you have sketchy water pressure to begin with."
"TY! The propane heater is a great idea - I'll need to leave the door cracked to avoid gas buildup.  I have read the propane heaters generate a lot of moisture in the air in the process of burning the gas.  However, the allure of completing all the painting in one day is oh-so-tempting."
"Thanks for the response. I def wont use the black flex tubing. Some people say to use PVC with holes so it does drain better, others say use a solid pipe so it allows the water to divert  away better. I'm leaning towards using the PVC with holes pointed down but I'm still researching. "
"Thanks for your help! I am a total noob at home improvement so can you help me make sure I understand this? This device would allow me to run a C wire to the thermostat from the transformer that is plugged into the wall, correct? Would that require me to run the cable through the wall?"
"Thanks. Just to clarify, Iü__m talking about the outside, not the inside. I was planning on spraying foam in, but will that also make it waterproof? Iü__m kind of thinking I need to foam it, and then seal the gap between the metal and concrete with some sort of sealant on top of that. "
"The intention is to offer the landlord the full deposit/additional compensation so I don't have to deal with the aftermath. Not going to find a subletter under these conditions.Currently in a critical career moment, and I want to resolve this quickly by throwing money at the problem."
"The issue is that I canü__t even get past a 1/16th inch into the wall. Iü__m waiting on my property manager to tell me whatü__s behind the wall, but it seems like Iü__m hitting cement or something. This is great advice though, looks like something that would work for other projects. "
The simplest solution to this is to add a second thermostat right on the furnace itself. If you add a second mechanical thermostat in parallel with the regular one and set it at 55 it won't interfere with the regular thermostat but will come on regardless of what the main one is doing.
"Then don't spend 3K:https://www.highseer.com/ultra-high-seer-inverter-mini-split-ductless/ductless-mini-split-heat-pump-wys009gm22.htmlThere are much cheaper versions available, and you can install it yourself, if you are a bit talented:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozaw9QhxkQU"
"There is the possibility, depending on the age of the original wallpaper, that they put it on raw (unprimed/painted) plasterboard. I took off 4 layers only to find that the last layer was applied directly to my drywall and I couldn't get it off without peeling off the drywall paper. :("
"This is the perfect time to get started. One option would be to just ""roundup""/kill the entire lawn and then till, soil, plant.You could also have someone cut out all the sod and follow the same steps above. That would avoid having to use roundup and you could get started right away."
Traditionally you would treat the two as separate spaces and vent each independently. However current insulation R value requirements pretty much require this to be spray foamed. Itü__s the only way to fit enough R value into the available space unless you were to fur down the rafters.
"Try a wood chisel. They cost about 10 bucks for a set with a few sizes and they arenü__t designed for this, but the sharp hard angled edge is great for cutting through the thinset. I discovered this after using an angle grinder with a masonry bit but the powdery mess wasnü__t worth it."
"Trying not to be a dick here, but a realtor puts you in touch with property to sell. The reason you donü__t interact with the seller is because itü__s against the interest of both realtors.  What if you guys wised up and agreed you didnü__t need someone to take a cut out of the deal?"
"Walk us through what you did step by step, please. We need to know your process, including the tools (actual make and model aren't necessarily important... just drum sander, orbital sander, etc.). Also what products you used (brands *are* important here) and how everything was applied."
"Yeah, it would be awkward to ask them that. And yes, the stairwell is acting like a chimney pulling all of my neighbors' weed smoke up to where I live. I open all of the windows in the stairwell, but it doesn't help.I'm just going to try the weather stripping and hope for the best."
Yes sorry. So still you taking out the cement board and putting in a new strip where the bottom layer of tile is wonü__t there always be that gap between the old  cement board and that new layer? I know it will be covered back up with tile and grout which I guess isnü__t a huge issue. 
"You are correct. In this case they're serving the same purpose which is what I meant by interchangeable. My comment above may have been misleading, apologies. I don't think block and sister would be necessary. One or the other will work just fine, assuming the correct fastening system."
"You are over-thinking this.  There are a dozen extender kits that will work for you, so doing this is not going to be a big deal.  Here is how one of them does it (from the National Hardware Show):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUeuY7oOYvMPick a product and move forward on this.  "
"You need a plumber, an electrician, and a floor guy.  No reason to use a GC for that, especially because it can all be done independently.  The only reason to use a GC is when you have multiple trades that will be tripping over each other if the schedules aren't organized properly.  "
"Your absolute cheapest option? A [plug-in thermostat](http://amzn.com/B071NG8MZK). And if you wanna change the heater, I use [one of these](http://amzn.com/B014TR6UIU) in the garage to keep it above freezing in the winter. You can even paint it the same color as the wall. Works well."

"maybe this will work in your favor if they can access the wires and use them in a new outlet in the wall where the hole is, which may be convenient for your tv and won't require patching if all goes well. (this is what I did in my garage when I did drilled through the romex as did you)"
"measure the door frame minus the white door sill, that's the rough opening. If it comes out 1/2 to 3/4 over it's fine. Tear out the sill (white stuff) and put in the entire prehung  door into the hole. Then attach it to the rough with screws, foam insulation in the gap and trim it out."
"right, but if one wants it cooler and one wants it warmer, they will be fighting each other in no time over the room temp. the only way to really accomplish what you want is to have zones controlled by individual thermostats, rather than giving everyone control over a global thermostat"
"&gt;a lot of work done by someone who didn't know what they were doinghahaha. Ding ding ding! The relative living there now has always had the enthusiasm for DIY maintenance and repairs, but not the know-how. Examples include where he ""fixed"" a crumbling stone wall by just piling rocks in front of it, or ""fixed"" a dripping sink by just removing the associated pipes (it currently drains into a bucket). Also, apparently the current electrical system can't handle more than two things running at once. We're gonna have a lot of work to do."
"Exactly. That looks amazing. I cut corners as much as I could so mine wasn't that nice.  Lumber is really cheap. The irony is that the hidden expensive part is hardware. I think I paid more for nails, braces and brackets and bolts than the lumber.Yeah concrete is really cheap without the labor. When I was looking for bids on my slab I looked into how much delivered concrete was and was flabbergasted at how cheap it was. That said, concrete isn't something you want to do if it's your first DIY. I'll pay for someone else to do that. "
"Have you tried this with success? I know it gets suggested a lot, but man I regret trying it. I had the same problem as OP when we bought our house. The bathroom tile was in great shape but the white grout was brown. I started with a grout scrapper, then tried the oscillating tool, then finally moved up to an angle grinder. It was so much effort I gave up after the floor was done and left the grout on the wall alone. It absolutely would have been quicker and easier for me to re-tile the floor I still kick myself for not doing that. "
"Hey there, my response is per my credentials as someone who works in residential glass. Quick questing, are the windows you want to find insulated glass?( double paned windows) If so, applying tinting to them can cause a window failure very quickly. This happens because tinting prevents insulated glass from releasing heat which in turn causes window failure. Window failure being when you see the space between the panes get foggy or you notice moisture in between the panes. If you have single pane windows you have nothing to worry about"
"I have a policy of being around to supervise.  Not looking over their shoulder, but just general ""I care about the quality, and am here for questions"". Assuming they will tarp everything on day one, I would be around a bit to make sure everything is covered correctly, then kinda pop in and out. Stay out of the way, but wander around, keep an eye on progress. If it's looking good, say so. If they're being really neat, tell them you noticed it and appreciate the effort. That way, if something goes off the rails, you'll know quite quickly."
"I love the colour you used under the picture rail. We recently bought the ground floor flat in a converted house that was originally build in 1925. The only original room left (at least within our flat, I havenü__t been in the upstairs flat) is what I think was the drawing room. Weü__ve got some gorgeous original wood panelling and a fireplace, plus the picture rail. The previous owners had painted the whole room an awful shade of peach. I went for white above the picture rail but a very similar shade as you chose below. It looks great!"
"I would add a canopy abutting the south wall with a tarp cover. They sell some that look quite good. The reason I would not go for trees (even deciduous) or a permanent shaded patio is to get that precious winter sun.In my location (in California) south walls are only a problem in early fall when the sun gets low but the heat hasn't subsided yet. In summer, the sun is high enough in the south that eaves are sufficient to shade a lot of the wall. The west wall and windows are more of a problem and trees on that side may be a good idea."

"It may just be as simple as the bladder in the pressure tank.  Simple test of your own:  Run the water until the well kicks on, then turn off the water and wait for the tank to fill and the pump shut off.  Now turn it on again and time how long it takes for the pump to turn on again.  If it turns on pretty quickly relative to the size of the tank, then the tank probably needs to be replaced.  The rest sounds like pure nonsense.Absent the report, I wouldn't pay the $320.  They may not want to commit the rest of the bullshit to paper.  "
"Its intimidating to start off on a project this big.  My suggestion is to start small.  Like find a house that has a couple of small things wrong or needs a few things done.  Or a house that has nothing really wrong, but could use something new added, like a shed or a deck.  Start small, learn, and over time after fucking up 15 or 20 times, you start to get a good sense of the right order things should happen, and what things tend to cost, and whats in your skill set or ability to learn.  That's how most of us got to where we are today!"
"Most probably a limescale between surfaces. There should be a screw in the front that holds the main body of faucet handle. Sometimes it is covered by a piece of rubber or plastic. Pop it, unscrew and clean everything with some good limescale remover.If you don't have one arround, drop few spoons of citric acid into hot water and dip it in. If will clean in half an hour. WD-40 was a bad idea. It could made it even worse.If removing limescale won't help, you will need to replace a valve inside - I would consult some plumber for that. "
"No one is going to try to re-tint paint and guarantee it will match the color you are looking for.  Most employees at paint places these days can only program the color in to the computer and dispense the tint.  Most won't even know how to do it manually let alone figure out the quantity of tints between your original and new color. Thats also assuming the two colors are using the same exact tint colors and just different quantities.  I've never seen where you can find the pigment levels for different colors to figure it out yourself."
"Ok, follow along....Take the ledger board down.Measure the distance from the set tile to the floor.Lay the tile out on the floor,with spacers, the same distance you measured. You will want to go one more sheet of tile that you need. Make a mark on the tile for the bottom where it would hit the floor which is the distance you measured (don't forget the spacer on the bottom). Cut the tile at that bottom line.Start at the bottom and set the tile going up. Your last tile should hit perfect, with the spacer, at the tile at the top."
"Seconding this...Iü__m a landlord who had a couple who wanted to buy a house but couldnü__t pay last months rent AND get the down payment. I know that feeling, they came to me and offered to do some light work around the house.  He worked at Home Depot installing carpets.  They fixed a few screens and put in a new carpet into one of the rooms.  Last month waived, and gave them extra time they to get the new place put together.  I think it was a month and a half in the end, but they even got their security deposit back.  No regrets."
"Start by opening the door to the equipment area. Sometimes broken fittings are obvious and you can start from there. Especially look at the heater, usually a silver tube with black fittings,it is a common failure point. Also look at the pump(s) they also can crack. Other than that just fill it up slowly and look for any water. It's best to fill through the opening where the filter goes. Don't do this right when it's supposed to be freezing outside or when  it is already freezing. If something is wrong you want to have time to repair it "
"Thank you, maybe we are just being impatient. I guess that is understandable. Iü__m sure they use IGRü__s as well.

"What in a house has a lot of rubber?The only thing I can think is that it might potentially wear your tires down a little quicker if you ran it in your car, but I'd have to think even that would be pretty minimal since  there's pretty minimal air transfer between the wheel and the interior.Is there a super common thing that's made up of rubber that makes it worth worrying about that I'm just totally missing? Or is it more one of those cool factoids that doesn't really make much of a difference in practice but is cool to be aware of."
"What you need is a product similar to that linked below.

"My suggestion because I would prefer to have a relatively warm kitchen floor for those mornings with coffee would be to leave the linoleum and install drycore platform over the whole area where applicable.  From there you can do anything youü__d like to your basement with a bit less anxiety about flooding Since your kitchen is down there, any potential minor floods could set you out of having a kitchen while cabinetry is replaced, fixed, etc. Raising the floor and leaving space for your basement to dry out without damaging your relatively important kitchen would remove some stress from my point of view. At that point you could do any flooring type youü__d like with a bit of modification Again the drycore can be expensive, but long run with the situation I would highly suggest it "
"Plaster walls do a much better job at sound reduction than modern drywall walls do. From outside and internal noises. It also adds character to your walls, lathe and plaster isnü__t really done anymore due to the cost, a 4x8 piece of drywall is much  quicker to install.  It cracks slightly over time but thatü__s part of the appeal. Plaster feels and sounds better than drywall, at least to me drywall sounds hollow and cheap. If it were my house I would absolutely keep the plaster walls. The screenshot you posted looks like itü__s from Kirk Giordanos YouTube channel, he is an excellent resource for plaster/stucco repair.  If youü__re handy at all it might be worth repairing it yourself. Iü__ve also heard that plaster is more fireproof than drywall, though Iü__m not certain on that. "
"Tldr: Maintaining proper expansion joints is top priority. The manufacturer wants to make it so that each room is independent of the other. This is so that if there's an issue in one room, it won't transfer for another. The only way for there to actually be an issue is if there's a major change in the temperature and/or humidity. With laminate, and those conditions, you might be screwed either way and the manufacturer's warranty won't cover those types of damages anyway. If you undercut the door jambs, it will give you plenty of room for expansion. In 12 years of not using them at each doorway, I've never had a problem (again, barring major or outside variables). Yeah anecdotal, but I live in a high humid area. As long as hvac is properly maintained and controlled, you're good to go. "
"Iü__m in a very similar position: drywall board and plaster walls, old wiring, lack of isolation per room, etc. As others have mentioned, to maintain code you are going to have to essentially re-wire the whole kitchen with new circuits. You will have to find out where other rooms branch off, and wire new homeruns for them. For me, I had to take the kitchen down to studs. I had to install new boxes for the other rooms, because they branched off in old ceiling boxes. Your new kitchen will require:-	2x20A circuits for outlets (12/2 &amp; GFCI outlets or breaker). Each outlet will have to be spaced one every 4 feet, with one at least 2 feet from each edge. (The code is complicated on spacing)-	1x15A circuit for the lights-	1x20A circuit for fridge-	1x20A circuit for microwave-	1x15A circuit for dishwasher-	1x15A circuit for disposal -	In some places you can combine the above two into a single 20A circuit. Check your local code-	1x50A circuit for range, if electricSome of the above is locally dependent, check your local code. You will need to check: -	Panel can support all the new circuits + new homeruns-	load calculation for your kitchenIf you canü__t add enough circuits, youü__ll need to install a sub-panel (most likely just for the kitchen), or upgrade your main panel.

"Agreed on the split bathrooms. I have 3 small children at the moment and I would hate having to go through their rooms to access their bathrooms. They might get more use out of it when they are older, but its also more space to clean. I 2nd u/ghettonet on the 2nd floor laundry instead. "
"Alright, my description isn't too great, but here's a [concept image](https://actionpatrimoine.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Images-pie%CC%80ce-sur-pie%CC%80ces-01.png).Basically, there are obviously vertical studs holding the roof up.. but the cavities are filled with wood planks."
"Also plans for a concrete washout. It can be a kiddy pool or a bag, but they can't wash it out in your drainage ditch or yard. Most of the low bidders I know just dump it on the ground and that's considered an illicit discharge per epa/deq because the PH is close to the same as draino. "
Another response asked me if there were stairs on the other side of this wall.  I was not thinking about them at all when I was doing this.  But it turns out they line up pretty perfectly with these angled studs.  I don't know how stairs are built but this is making much more sense now.
As someone in Iowa who just went through a ton of estimates for a master suite I can tell you that price is high comparatively but many of these contractors have more work than they can bite off right now so they are straight up adding thousands onto their quotes in case someone bites. 
"As we're looking into replacing them, is there any consideration in choosing sliding vs french besides our personal preference? We'd want all- or mostly-glass doors either way, 6 ft wide. And now that I think of it, we don't necessarily need both panels to open, if that matters. Thanks!"
"Basically you need to have a certain amount of vent area for the area of your attic.  There are a few calculators online that can give you a rough estimate of what you need.You may not be able to use a ridge vent as your ridge is fairly short and my not provide adequate ventilation.  "
"Could you expand on that a little bit?  I have some areas I'd like to level out, some being a few inches deep, but I was worrying about killing the grass if the new soil was too deep.  Is there a limit on how much dirt you should put down?  Also keeping it from washing away if it rains."
"Depending on the age the kiddie harnesses are interchangeable with the new 10yr battery back ups.  Just unplug and plug in the new ones with the new mounting plate. If there not itü__s a simple switch with the wires. Black to black. White to white. Red to red on the kiddie detectors. "
"Do you have a stud finder?  The diagonal likely continues on past the right stud to stiffen the wall. The third pic makes it look like the stud in question is behind the intended position of the TV, you might just want to take out enough drywall to drill another hole through the stud."
"Either add another wax ring to that one for when you ""seat"" the new toilet. Or buy an oversized wax ring to ""seat the new toilet. As long as the sub floor beneath it isn't wet and trashed you should be able to install the new toilet and get it secured with the bolts and a new wax ring. "

"Fair enough. I still would be concerned about stability. A post and footing that was designed for a lightweight 3-4ü__ chain fence may have a tough time supporting the weigh and wind pressure of something 5-6ü__ tall and made of wood.Can you block the view with a few strategic plants?"
"From where? I will need it for more than four hours (30+ holes and I don't want to be rushed), and then it costs like $75 for a day. If I'm spending $75 with pickup and dropoff, I might as well own @ $200 shipped to me, then sell it if I choose to at $125 and have no time restrictions. "
"Get quotes on hardwood refinishing. I think youü__ll be surprised how affordable it is. That was one of the first things we had done after we closed on our house this summer. Like others have said, itü__s easier before youü__ve moved in, and you probably donü__t want to do it yourself. "
"Glad to see someone actually answering the thread!  OP, where ya at? There's a few demolition companies in the Philadelphia area I've come across that salvage things from old builds on the condemned list. I wouldn't be surprised if you could scare up a vintage rolling library ladder. "
"Had you considered hiring an HVAC guy to see if this is doable?  I have no idea if your home's system has the capacity for the additional square footage you'll be adding.  Before breaking into the existing system, a manual j calculation should be run to verify that your idea would work."
"He wouldnü__t consider himself ü__veryü_ù handy. In fact, he will probably be aggravated when he sees that I called him that. What reference materials did you find to be the most useful? Thanks in advance! I wasnü__t sure you would respond at all - what with the post being months old!"
"I got this done when I bought my house 2 years ago, sealed the house from the peak of the attic to the basement, new led bulbs new blown insulation throughout the attic, weather stripped external doors, even the attic hatch. All for $300, best move we made all it takes is a phone call. "
I have an electrician over this morning to replace my main panel. He got this thing installed into the stud with lag bolts in 10 minutes. The magnetic stud finder I bought at Home Depot helped. Thankfully I donü__t have to do the hair brained anchoring adhesive idea I was going to try. 
"I'd be more concerned about asbestos in the adhesive than the tile, TBH. And yeah, Henry's is marketed as more of a DIY product. Still a solid product, though... more than sufficient for OP's small flooring project. If he was doing his entire kitchen or a full bath, Arditex all the way."
"I'll recommend this, my buddy had spiders really bad, and he bombed his whole house with fogger and it worked wonderfully. Clean every surface afterward to get rid of any leftover chemicals. &amp;#x200B;Also, turn off your pilot lights, unless you want to take ""bug bomb"" literally. "
"If the kitchen cabinets are placed before the tile guy has a chance to come in and tile... well then the tile guy has to tile up against the toe kick.Found that out when I ripped the kitchen out in my house. Clearly the hardwood was installed AFTER the cabinets and everything went in."
"If the shower is the only single handle fixture that has this problem it may need a new cartridge. The cold side can have higher water pressure than hot due to the valve in the tankless.But first I would clean the strainer/filter thing in the water heater, it may be reducing the flow."
"If the spots are that small then just mud over them.  Put a skim coat of mud over regions where the paper is frayed and sand that.  Sanding the bare paper will make it worse.  Maybe replace regions where most/all of the paper has been removed over an area 16"" or larger in any direction."
In general the crew is expected to work around and move your stuff. If you have bookcases full of books though or anything valuable I would empty it out. They can lift up a bed or something but a lot of stuff does have to be emptied. When you get a quote you can talk to them about this.

Iü__m sorry but I donü__t understand your train of thought. A new buyer might value  an existing window since they wouldnü__t have to go through the trouble of putting one in themselves...? Or they might value a brighter room? A more symmetric room? What does newness have to do with it?
"Iü__m speaking in a limited sense to the plumbing and not the medium (natural gas).  With a plumbing problem like this just cut it at a run with 6-12 inches with a sawzall and use a union and a couple of nipples. Easy. Just make sure that the union is in an easy to reach location. "
"Iü__ve demoed dozens and dozens of bathrooms and that looks like the original 100+ year old tile to me. The square, non rounded edges are what give it away. You could email the design firm who did it. They were the first thing who popped up when I reverse image searched the first photo."
"Like the idea for the aesthetics of it, but I would be concerned that in a heavy rain (which OP mentions happen frequently), the rush of water would overwhelm such a system, especially in a corner like this where a large surface area is all be diverted to a single downspout (downchain?)"
"No wall is plumb/straight and thus, the tiles need to be cut to the shape of the wall. Of course, that will make them different sizes. In some areas, it will be more visible than others.Edited to add: Normally, the differences in widths would be shared between 2 edges, but it's normal."
"Nope. It slides in the existing hole for the box, then you screw down the angled screws which secure it to the joist nice and tight. They're a simple but amazing upgrade from typical old work boxes. Let me know if you can't find them, but a quick search should bring up several results"

"So should the post sit in to the gravel, or be flush with the bottom of the concrete?  This was my game plan, but I wasn't going to lower the post in to the gravel.  I was also going to treat the wood that's sunk with some kind of sealing/bedding compound.https://imgur.com/9zmJKNI.jpg"
"So, another possibility is that your place has a circulating pump that routes hot water through cold water pipes such that the hot water comes on much faster when you turn it on. The way to tell is that somewhere on a return line to your water heater will be a little recirculating pump."
"Somewhere along the pipe has developed a block. Iü__d check the hoses from the wall to the tap, the tap mixer and actual tap. Often there are small metal filters on the ends of the hoses and when they do work on the pipes, dirt and crap gets into them. The small filter will be blocked."
"Sure. It's how ever you want to see it. I consider those stairs in the footprint of the yard, where the others are build directly onto the deck. But I understand what you mean. Like I said though, build the deck YOU want. I was just trying to make sure you had thought about this detail."
"Take a look above it. Everyone here is joking about how pathetic this looks, but it *could* support some weight, especially if it's a 4x4 (hard to say from the photo). You just want to make sure there's not a big AC unit or a soaking tub above it or something. Don't leap to conclusions."
"The further you get from the border the less likely folks are aware of the sales tax exemption. ""Michael"" was just blowing smoke to cover his ignorance and you did the right thing to ignore him and contact corporate [which may have saved you some frustration had you done it earlier....]"
"The one caveat I might make to this is a cordless drill. All the companies compete pretty heavily. I would pay a little bit more for an entry level ""name"" brand drill. It will get used by pretty much any homeowner, doens't cost a ton more, and will work way better than the $25 no namer."
"Unless the rim joist and foundation stem wall are insulated and all vents sealed up, it should be avloided. Tha rim joist is a notorious location for air leaks and heat losses. And your foundation stem wall and footing act as a highly efficient radiator conducting energy into the earth."
"When you say plumbers tape, do you mean teflon tape?  Don't use teflon tape on PVC.  It's not necessary, and can cause failure.There's a nylon washer between the coupling nuts and the trap.  It's either missing, or installed upside down. These washers a beveled, and fit into the trap."
Wow lots of opinions and options.  I would still test it and go from there.  In my old house in the (616) we added fiberglass battens over the rock wool and added gable vents.  5 years later we needed the new roof and at that time installed a ridge vent.  I feel your pain.  Good luck.  
"Years ago I lived in a very old, drafty house. One month my gas bill was, I shit you not, $700. As soon as I got that bill, I went and got those kits with the plastic and double-sided tape and covered every window in the house. Next month the gas bill was a much more reasonable $200ish."
"Yep, grease is going to be thicker and stick around longer than oil (and even then, WD-40 is more of a solvent than a lubricant). You could use real grease too, which would probably last longer, but also be more annoying to apply. With aerosol lithium grease, you can just spray and go. "
"Yes do a white gauzy curtain. Itü__ll let sunlight in while obscuring the view from the outside. You might also look at some temporary tinting that will obscure the view inside but that could be removed when you move. If you donü__t go too dark, it may not be obvious to the management. "
"Youü__re gonna need a glazier to get the glass made, ask what they think as far as thickness.  10mm sounds about right.  Absolutely yes this should be tempered glass.Edit:  I would just run pieces of trim for the glass to rest on.  A couple tiny dabs of silicone will keep it in place."

"A few things I just thought of... the lamp that wonü__t work - is the bulb good? (Maybe it just happened to die when you unplugged it/moved the lamp). Or perhaps when you unplugged it/plugged it back in, something failed inside the outlet. You could troubleshoot this with something like your phone charger that you know works.

"Ah. You should maybe mention that part if you don't want the rest of the country to think you're daft.I'm in Chicago suburbs.

"Any projects involving external framing work is going to be very, very costly.My detached one-car garage cost $3k to re-roof and put siding on two walls - and I am in a smaller city in the Northeast. You're going to need the existing roof removed, entirely new framing, insulation, drywall, electrical, HVAC and possibly plumbing. Same for shrinking the windows, plus siding and the cost of the windows.I'm going to say both projects are *easily* $20k worth of work. I would find something different unless you have a lot of cash to spend."
"Did you have this inspected along with your house when you purchased the property?I would be mostly concerned with the structural integrity of that barn.  The indicators are the diagonal bracing along the studs.  These were clearly added after it was built and must have been added because of tilting or swaying.Especially being new to renovations or DIY home improvements, I would have it inspected by a licensed/insured professional.Everything else (electrical, sound proof insulation and drywall, etc.) is extra and just nice to have."
"Hey everyone! Sorry for the delayed response- I've been out of town for most of the week. I ended up following your recommendations of moving the scald guard the same day I posed this, and it worked like a charm! The scald guards (actually on both showers in our home) looked like they were not seated properly where they should have been, maybe through ignorance or accident of a previous tenant. Regardless, the shower gets piping hot now. No kids in the near future, but I will definitely remember this when I get to that point! Thanks all!"
"I mean even if you donü__t live in one house your whole life the large purchase might as well be considered a life long purchase, since you are likely going to move to another house if you move at all.We went through all these phases.

"I'd look in the attic for dark areas of insulation, indicating moisture buildup or a possible roof leak. Insulation itself really doesn't need any maintenance, unless you decide to add more.Air sealing is a good practice, there's always areas you forget about that let out a lot of heat. Such as bad weatherstripping around doors and windows, electrical boxes in exterior walls, exhaust vent flaps stuck open, etc. Sometimes basement windows or windows of infrequently used rooms are left open by mistake when the weather suddenly gets cold."
"I've been so frustrated with this issue that I write the install date in marker on the white part below the glass.So far, my longest lasting LED's made it to about 3 years of normal use.  For HD Cree, if you call Cree, they will tell you to bring it back to Home Depot and replace it.  I keep the original receipt and packaging in a cabinet.  So in reality, I return them once or 2x.Feit are the WORST.  They last about 1 - 2 years.In my back room and downstairs bathroom, I have 20 year old incandescent bulbs that function perfectly."
"Knowing where your main shut off is one of the first thing I point out to clients when buying a home. (Or, just like this case, after owning it). As a home owner, you need to learn this right away. I am not being mean or saying anything bad about you, but I educate all homeowners on the overlooked ""small"" things that can save a disaster. So, get in that crawlspace and find it!

"Long term I agree I would want to integrate into the overall heating/cooling system. We have used these heaters: https://www.amazon.com/Lasko-CD09250-Adjustable-Thermostat-Under-Desk/dp/B0735MVY4Y/And never had problems. This one has controls that mean it will turn on if it gets power. So just team it up with an Alexa compliant plug like a wemo or something (lots to choose from). Then you'll be able to control it from your Alexa. Just my two cents but any time you use a space heater like this, make sure you also have a fire alarm. "
"The last place I rented had this problem. I bought a roll of screen material, cut it and nailed it into place on the outside. I then used high quality black duct tape in between nails (I folded the tape and put it between the screen and the wood).  It didn't look that bad. Elegant? No. Permanent? I'd assume not (although the house just sold with it in place).  But it was dead cheap and could be done very fast and with limited skill. I live in WA where people don't have central air, you can't survive the summer without opening windows. "
There's two kinds of switches for this.  There's the fancy digital ones that require you connect to a hot+load+neutral+ground or you can get a mechanical switch and that is like a simple light switch.  Before you do this you should see what kind of wiring you have.  For example at my old house I had to use a mechanical switch since there was no neutral to connect as they ran the fan switch separate the light switches to a different wall.  At my new house I was able to get a digital one since all the stuff was in a single box on one wall.
"&gt; The vast majority of people use WD40 for an issue because it is immediately available.I slightly disagree here. I'd argue that that the majority of people use WD40 because they think it's a proper lubricant *because it's immediately available*. IOW, it's been marketed as a household item for so long, and it's sold in so many places, people just eventually started assuming it's a lube. It's handy because it's always available. But it's always available because so many people erroneously assume it's for lubricating. And so every store carries it.And the cycle continues. It gets to where people start to think that's just how long lube lasts. ""Welp, it's been a week. Gotta WD40 the gate hinges again.""Frankly, we need more people spreading the ""WD40 isn't lube"" gospel, IMO.Cheers."
"Fix the water leak, first.  plaster delamination is caused by three things.  First is improper installation, but if it's not new, that's not likely.  Second is motion, where the scratch coat is moving because the keys are broken.  Third is water.  fix process is: make sure the water leak is fixed.  Remove any loose white coat.  Make sure the wall is solid, it shouldn't move when you push on it.  If it does, you need to fix that.  plaster washers and screws will fix small areas, or you can inject glue.  Coat the area with a bonding agent, like Larsen's Plaster-weld.  Coat with a top coat.  I use proper lime plaster, but you can use a setting drywall compound.  Let dry, prime, paint.  If you you're using drywall mud, there's a sand step in there that's not required with proper plaster."
"If its vented and I'm assuming it is because most are I would think that would be a complete waste only slightly more effective they opening the front door to heat up your yard. I mean maybe the thought process is the heat will rise and settle in the joists to keep the plumbing slightly above freezing but it seems like a really efficient way to do that. When its cold you could run the heat for hours and maybe raise the tem a few degrees, but once the heats goes off it would go right back down again. I had a crawl and I hated it. im the winter the floor was freeing and the hose bled heat so bad.

"NO! You should forget table saws, ""speed squares"" and other add-ons to circular saws. None will readily deliver the best square cuts without more expertise than you seem to have. Some of the options mentioned in the comments are potentially very dangerous when used by just-occasional DIYers.For the best and safest results rent a 12"" miter saw (which is sometimes incorrectly called a ""chop saw""). Then take 2 minutes to nail together a couple of two by fours to support and level-up the free end of the flooring with the stock support plate of the miter saw. Trying to keep a lengthy piece of flooring from lifting because the free end is unsupported is a recipe for disaster on any type of powered saw,Miter saw - it's safe, easy, fast, and perfectly square-cutting for just-occasional DIYers"
"So I'm not an expert by any means I've just been doing a ton of research on mold here lately so take my advice with a grain of salt!From what I've found, bleach and water is actually a terrible treatment for mold. Bleach doesn't do well on porous surfaces and is corrosive to the wood plus it evaporates quickly leaving the water for the mold to thrive on. You can pick up a spray bottle of concrobium mold control at lowes or home depot for a couple bucks and spray that onto a rag and wipe off the mold.It sounds like you're on track with the drainage and dehumidifier to keep the humidity and moisture down. If you fix the source of the problem then the mold isn't a big problem.As for knowing if the mold is harmful or not you'd've to have it tested by a lab to determine what mold it is. "
"Thanks man. I appreciate the good words.I spent $2000 on it and as of right now I have about $3000 in parts.Most expensive part was the carpet at $500. Carpet has really gone up in price lately for some reason. I had my whole house carpeted for $700 about 8 years ago from the same place I'm using to carpet this place.Next most expensive was the trenching to hook up water and sewer. After doing the electric line trench by hand, I said no f'n way was I doing the water and sewer. That cost me $400. Was going to be $200, but I was off by about 5 feet on where the water line was at and it got damaged. The trencher guy stuck around and helped up find the water line before the damage and fix everything, so since a 1 hour job turned into a 5 hour, I gave him a $200 tip for being a cool guy."
"Things to try, leave to soak for an hour or two then scrub (wear gloves):Bleach - this will remove mildew, or use a bathroom/tile mold &amp; mildew remover which has bleach in it.Oxiclean 40 volume cream developer - you'll find this in beauty supply stores like Sally beauty supply or on Amazon.  It is used to bleach hair and is basically very concentrated hydrogen peroxide in a cream.  It's more potent then the type of hydrogen peroxide you buy in the first aid section of a drug store and since it is a cream it stays where you put it better than a liquid.Be sure you're using a stiff brush to scrum.

"Very true. I grew up down there. The area I was raised in consisted of smaller, mostly one story concrete block houses that weren't really what anyone wanted when looking for a house, even if the area was nice.

"&gt; The NEC is saying they don't need to be flush with the drywall. The boxes are attached to the stud. The stud is 1/2"" back inside the wall.

"Bro, you aren't even interested in having a conversation with me. If you aren't going to read what I'm posting don't even reply.I was quoted 16 hours of labor to screw a garden hose into an outlet on a valve. Open said valve. Wait 20 minutes for water to drain. Nothing wrong could happen to justify the quote. I filed a complaint with the company about the quote. Guess what happened? The president of the company contacted me embarrassed that his project manager had quoted me that. They sent out a plumber to take care of it for free the next day. It took under 1 hour to fully drain it and fully fill it. The guy who came to do the work couldn't believe the quote.Want me to forward your comments onto the project manager? He could use the support, he was let go shortly after. The boiler quote was high because he works on commission and has no problem gouging people to make a fatter check. So yes, you're right it was what he wanted to do. You win this conversation! Scamming is ok as long as it's what you want yo do and no one questions it!"
"It's the customers.  Anything that can be picked up and put back will get mixed up.  Sometimes entire boxes will be moved around (super common in plumbing stuff).  I recommend always checking any single part you get.  Doesn't matter if it's a 6"" screw or a 10' ft of pipe if someone can pick it up out of a bin/bay and put it back in there later it'll get mixed up.  I think the worst is when they're running low on a given item and people just use that box as the 'junk box' so you actually have sift through 20-30 things to find the one part you actually need.Always check the markings and bar codes.  It's a good practice even if you're sure you have the right item because it's not super uncommon for the bar codes to mangled to the point where a scanner can't read them too, especially on rounded items or anything that tends to sit on the shelf a while.  That's without even considering stuff that gets returned and just thrown back on the shelf without anyone even attempting to clean it or check if some yahoo damaged it/put a nail through it.  "
"Silverfish usually donü__t eat wood, their primary diet in the home is cellulose and plant based fibers.  The most common food source for them is the paper backing on the insulation in your attic and walls.  They just chill behind the drywall nibbling on the paper for decades.  They also donü__t really need water as the paper takes on ambient moisture that they use.Honestly the best (and cheapest) thing you can do is control and live with it.  Keep your floors/areas clean and clear, sweep a lot, and keep your home dry (as in ensure your roof is solid, windows seal well, etc.).  They also are negatively phototactic (sp? - Donü__t like light), so leaving some lights on helps in hot and humid months when they get active.  Unless you have a few dozen scurrying away when you walk into a room I wouldnü__t worry about it.You will never get them all, and they donü__t bite or damage much, so an exterminator is just a waste.  They wonü__t be able to do much better than the result of you not keeping you dirty clothes in the corner on the floor."
"Yeah a switch is just a switch which gives 100% power so it'll be fine, even if you find a smart switch.  As far as dimming goes though, 0-10 volt is how this works and they come with a positive and negative LV wire that you have to connect to the the Dim+ and Dim- terminals.  So essentially, if the light detects 10 volts, it'll be at 100% and if its 4 volts it's at 40% dim.  Simple but works for commercial where they run dozens of lights that are otherwise not dimmable with regular dimmers.The problem is with automation, there won't be a cheap solution. I think the cheapest residential system that will work with this is Radio Ra2 and you'd need to have a dealer do it since the PowPaks that use 0-10volt are in the ""inclusive"" version.  You CAN use Caseta with it but you'd need to get the Caseta pro dimmer PD-10NXD dimmer and link it to a GRX-TVI interface so it won't be easier but certainly MUCH cheaper than Radio Ra2 and Caseta is a great system.  Anyway, good luck. Just wanted to keep you from hooking up a regular dimmer to this!"
"Itü__s a matter of ü__shinglingü__.  Just like you install the bottom row of shingles on a roof and work your way to peak,  with each higher layer overlapping a lower layer.  Any water that falls on the highest shingle keeps running over the top of the next layer down.  Water canü__t get under a shingle, itü__s always on top.  https://www.jlconline.com/how-to/roofing/q-a-asphalt-shingle-nailing_oIf you extend this idea all the way down the exterior walls, itü__s the same thing, but done with flashing, House wrap, j channels, etc.   Start with understanding how shingles on a roof direct water, and some YouTube videos on roofingü__s, siding, window installation, and youü__ll see the logic behind everything.  Water always gets pushed to the outside/top of next layer down if itü__s done right. It would be worth it to hire a pro to take care of a few smaller parts of the job (reinstall a window with j channel?) and watch what they are doing and ask questions.  Once you see how it works, itü__s not rocket science.  Donü__t feel bad.  I had a professional builder build a house for me, president of county builder assoc, and he screwed up some things installing windows which led to water leaks.  And get more than one estimate!  If a president of county builder assoc, a licensed builder, can screw this up other contractors can too.  Stupidity and halfassery is everywhere.  Caulk is a bandaid, and pricey.  It will stop water for a bit, but itü__s a bandaid.  Water will eventually get behind it.  You gotta manage the water using shingle logic. "
"I put in bamboo flooring at my first house.  I want to say that it was strand.  My wife and I were unimpressed as we experienced many dents.  Not much in the way of scratches but it seemed to dent easily.  I donü__t know the brand but it was from a big box hardware if that helps.  As far as the install/DIY Iü__d say go for it as long as youü__re somewhat experienced at that point in my life I had never done any hardwood flooring.  I also ran it a 45 degree angle which I think was pretty cool as around here in Ohio I havenü__t saw any other hardwood ran like that.  The only thing I will say that I didnü__t think of when I started was that if youü__re going start in a room and continue through your whole house or one whole floor is at some point youü__ll get to a place that you will have install backward if that makes sense.  So for me I started in the living room then down a small hallway then it cut through the doorway into a bedroom at which point it ran diagonally to the opposite side of the room cutting the room half basically so everything in front of me had the tongues facing forward or the same as the rest of the floor.  But then the rest of the behind that had the groove so I had to lay the floor with the tongue to the left and groove on the right.  So I had to use regular air nails and nail all of it through the groove.  Which even laying TNG depending on how your house is laid out you would get into the scenario in closet maybe anyhow.  I can explain that further if youü__d like.  Let me know.  Aside from that I would say DIY that stuff if you have a miter saw and the other small hand tools and access to flooring nailer.  If you can get a nailer thatü__s air assisted would be nice the one I used was all hand powered which wasnü__t bad but air assist would have been sweet.  "
"Oh how I do NOT envy you! (just finished remodeling my own bathroom ... did the demo and the actual remodel myself.) Get yourself a good chisel/crowbar for removng the floor tile, as this will definitely be the worst part of the demo (assuming it was laid properly). Obviously if the tile guy skimped on mortar, it will come up much more easily. I remember being extremely frustrated by how long the floor tile took to remove. The drywall and wall tile will be much easier. And make your initial holes in the drywall very carefully/slowly so you donü__t nick any pipes or electrical lines (turn off bathroom circuit at circuit breaker and even water supply if you are able to ... just until everything is exposed).Another good tip is to leave some of the drywall if you are not planning on replacing the ceiling. It will be less of a pain to mud/tape an extra butt joint than to mud/tape a plane change without disturbing the existing ceiling. Instead, mark a level line on the drywall about a foot below the ceiling and use a circular saw (set to 1/2ü__ depth or however thick the drywall is) to cut it. Then just remove all of the drywall below that line. The contractor you choose may remove the rest of the drywall anyway, but I remember one of the ones we met scolding me for removing all of the drywall if we werenü__t going to replace the ceiling.Once you remove the drywall, there will be dried construction adhesive left on some the studs. This was another massive pain for me to remove, and you do have to remove it or youü__ll have no hope of the new drywall sitting flat. One trick I came up with is to use an iron about half an inch away and ü__steamü__ it for 20 seconds or so before trying to scrape it off with a chisel. You could also grind it, but the friction from the grinder wheel heats it into a sticky mess.You will be astounded at the amount of waste produced ... make sure you have a plan for that (big plastic bins, ü__contractor bagsü__, friend with a pickup truck to go to the dump, etc.)Donü__t underestimate the amount of work ü__ good luck!"
"You can think of  modern brick as just thick siding.  It has no structural purpose and the material can be sanitized.  99% chance the brick is fine.The way homeowners policies work is on an open perils basis which means you have coverage unless it's excluded.   Wear and tear as you mentioned is a common exclusion.   As it should be you don't call your insurance company when you need new tires or brakes on your car  unless you need new tires or brakes because they got damaged in an accident.  Mold is excluded by every insurance policy I've ever seen.   However some policies have a mold endorsement which will give you back a limited amount of mold coverage.    As per the IICRC s520 international standards,  less than 10 solid square feet of mold and no testing or specific action is required other than to remove the damaged material and sanitize the area.    There are also exclusions for long-term damages and requirements that you report the claim within a certain period of time.    Just depends on your policy and your insurance company.   It sounds as if you've already filed a claim for the surface damages and they've paid that.   Cash that check and then let them know.   They're not going to take back the money they already paid but they may or may not pay for the additional damages.   If it was me,   I would make a trip to Home Depot pick up some microban and either buy or rent a high power fan/air mover or two if you don't already have one.  You could also use a dehumidifier if you have one.  Then go to town with a utility knife some gloves and a garbage bag.  Cut out the damaged drywall until it's no longer wet and feels solid. (Please use a utility knife it looks like you've caused extra damage by using a hammer. ) In the end you'll  take the drywall out halfway through the next stud after it's solid so that you can patch a new piece in.      Once you've ripped out all the damaged material spray that microban everywhere.    Then turn on the dehumidifier and the fans.  The goal is to get air circulation so line the fans up in a way that creates a circular movement if possible.This is exactly what a water mitigation company would do.      Again your insurance company may or may not pay for the damages but you can certainly ask.    Just depends on your policy and the coverages.  "
"Don't panic.I spent the first year in my new house pulling my hair out about what I thought were foundation problems. It wasn't worth it. The anxiety was ridiculous and worse than anything in my life.Turns out a lot of what I thought were ""changes"" was just me noticing things that had likely been there the whole time. I just spent more time in the house and began paying closer attention to things. Once I realized that I kept looking at these things and noticed they haven't changed at all this year, and that nothing is so pressing that I need to panic.Are you planning on staying here for a long time? Is this the forever home? If so, don't panic, make sure to patch up the cracks around your doors, and keep an eye on things in future years and see if they begin to reappear. If they do, have another structural engineer who specialized in foundations come out and do another assessment. If this is your forever home, you may need to sink some money into foundation repair eventually, but that's just part of the cost of owning a home. Your doors sticking can be seasonal as well. Nearly all my doors are sticking right now, but with winter and dryer air coming, some of them will go back to the way they were last winter where they just open if you look at them the wrong way. Your floors are probably settling after installation, and vinyl plank is usually a floating installation which means if the subfloor isn't completely perfectly level, parts of it will be squishy. All my rooms with vinyl plank have some squishiness, it's not a sign of serious foundation issues. I think one of the worst things I did was google ""foundation issues"". It's like reading WebMD. You go online looking for info on your minor chest pain (acid reflux), and you end up at a cardiologist that same day convinced you're having a heart attack (true story). Foundation issues in older houses usually are not something that needs immediate attention (outside of a massive flood/landslide/earthquake that can compromise things in an instant). It has stood for 50+ years, it's not likely to collapse in the next week. Take a deep breath, accept that your home has some character, and keep a watchful eye on things getting worse over the coming months/years. If they do, you will handle it. There is nothing that can't be fixed, so make sure you save some money in an emergency fund and keep a decent savings account so when the time comes you can have it all fixed up right. The house is not going to fall in on you. I spent some nights in my house convinced it was coming down. It's not. "

"Youü__d want someone in person to evaluate that itü__s ok, but I have a 2ü__x2ü__ chunk out of my houseü__s original foundation for ducts to an addition. It appears to have been a concrete saw on the sides then beat with a large hammer until it broke off based on how rough the bottom is."
"Youü__ll be perfect will a skill saw. Baseboard will cover any issues you have as long as they arenü__t too big of issues.I use a skill saw every day and can tell you that what you can do with them is insane if your good. I cut finish cabinetry with it far easier then with a table saw."
Youü__re going to have to insulate that ceiling too and the only way to do it is to remove whatever ceiling finish you have and putting in some fiberglass batts. The ceiling is even more important than the walls since you lose more heat there. Got a pic of the room? It would help a lot. 
[This](https://www.etsy.com/listing/245847492/medium-duty-hidden-floating-shelf?ref=shop_home_active_7&amp;bes=1) is what you need. There are a bunch of sizes and strengths. It's more work but they are ridiculously strong. I have one holding up a fairly large microwave without a problem.
"depth... hard to say.  I would guess its probably not deeper than 3'... but if its bubbling up like this, maybe its shallower than that...  the real bitch will be if its not bubbling straight up.  You can turn on the pump as you dig to see where the water is coming from and dig that way."
"How would anyone every think or know about the 6-32 device hole being slotted?  All the time in this sub I see images where people don't cut the ears off devices when they use them in old work boxes.  What they are doing wrong is visible as they are doing it.  What is behind a plate can't be seen unless the plate is removed.  The electrician on 'Ask This Old House', at least once, put a device into an old work box without cutting off the ears. Other times he has correctly cut off the ears.  Maybe a viewer informed him where he screwed up."

"I had a similar issue where the water was coming through my basement walls (not crawl space like yours).  I called many contractors and they all suggested various different things that would cost me thousands.  After some research, I found the quickest and cheapest solution would be to throw some dirt around my foundation and pitch it so the water goes away from the foundation.  I also extended my drain pipes.  Immediately after doing this, no more water issue in the basement.  Problem solved with $200 and some labor.  Hope this helps.   "
"If I'm looking at houses with a master bath, I wouldn't pick the house without a tub in the master bath. Where we live the houses are so small and old that you will never find a master bath. When we were buying our house I told my partner that it had to have at least a tub/shower combination. I like taking a bath about once a month and it would just feel weird to use the tiny tub in the guest room rather than something in my own bathroom. Go for a freestanding soaker tub, not one of those jacuzzi monstrosities that take up half the room. "
"If you want to reduce the number of trips from the basement to the attic, do this:Arbitrarily number the 5 wires in the attic. * Connect B+W of wire #1* Leave wire #2 untouched.* Connect #3W with #4W* Connect #4B with #5BThen, in the basement, find the wire with no resistance B-W - that's #1Find the two runs with no resistance W-W - they're 3&amp;4, but you can't tell which is which, yet.Find the two runs with no resistance B-B - they're 4&amp;5, so now you know which is #4.

"Iü__m not sure that would be possible to have your pool pump act as a sump pump.

Sorry for the delayed response... I figured it out after testing basically every set of ceiling wires because I was getting power at every one except this one.  I noticed something after opening up and testing the others that had power.  The wires that I wasn't getting voltage from the electrician did not strip any of the wires of the insulation so the wire wasn't touching the fan wire.  Probably should've been the first thing I tested but I'm brand new to electrical work and wasn't expecting shotty electrical work.  Thanks for your help!

"Spend ~$35 and buy a circuit breaker detector.  You plug one bit into the outlet,  then run the detector over your circuit brackets - it'll tone on the one you're looking for. Then write it down. All my outlets and lights are labeled with numbers,  those correspond to the breaker number. Instead of a vague,  faded scrawled note I have a spreadsheet taped up that shows breaker number,  an overview of what it covers, then the outlet and light numbers that use it. It's one of those things you can do overtime,  and it comes in so handy"
"There are two things I would look into (from my middle european perspective). Both should be a more permanent solution than wrap over the windows.1. Close any holes. You can add a seal to most doors and windows. There is no point in heating a room if you are venting the warm air outside.2. Heat goes up. Insulate your roof. Put minieral wool  between the rafters (don't forget the plastic sheet). Alternatively put mineral wool on the floor of you attic (if you have any). Insulating your house will also keep your house cool during summer!"
"post your furnace make/model and /or search for an exploded parts view of your furnace.  Can't tell from the photo whether the break is part of the furnace or just a PVC pipe break.BTW  you can make a PVC repair in a non-pressure pipe by using primer and PVC cement. The cement softens the pipe and effectively ""welds "" the pipe together. I would guess however the break is the result of the fittings forced together and under strain. You might struggle yo get the pipe correctly aligned to make a glue repair without making other adjustments"
"Fucking landlords and their ""handymen"". My last (and final) landlady had a handyman who worked on our condo unit. A few months in, the brand new over-the-range microwave stopped working. It'd run, but the magnetron was obviously borked.Luckily, handyman wasn't available, so she let me call an electrician. Turns out, the dumbass had installed the microwave by removing the existing range hood and sticking a 20amp outlet on the existing 15amp circuit that was powering the tiny light and fan in the hood. It also powered a living room circuit where all my A/V and network gear was plugged in. Thankfully, nothing was damaged.Electrician just shook his head and said, ""Handyman, huh? Idiot.""I lost several hours that week coordinating the install of the new circuit and a replacement microwave."
"If you are dead-set on using tape, then taping to a panel of corrugated cardboard, [foam board](https://www.dollartree.com/readi-board-white-foam-boards/809955) or masonite board cut to fit the tile will save the rest of the tile finish. A $1 can of Lowes white spray paint will go a long way to fixing the current appearance of the tile.But go with a magnetic vent cover:There are [box-type magnetic vent covers](https://www.amazon.com/Elima-Draft-Insulated-Magnetic-Cover-Rectangular/dp/B00Q6S7T3G) that will (if sized to the vent) fit over the louver-adjusting lever and seal well, or you can pop off the grill and remove the louver mechanism so that you have a flat surface to seal with the [sheet-magnet cover](https://www.amazon.com/Accord-AMAGCOV815-Magnetic-8-Inch-15-Inch/dp/B0052EB648)."
"It really depends on the budget and I take online reviews with a grain of salt.  If 100 people buy the same faucet and only 5 people review it, that's not necessarily a good picture of how it will perform.  Complaints like ""leaky faucet"" or ""weak pressure"" are often caused by poor installation or problems with the plumbing itself and not the fixture.[This](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/facts-faucets) is a pretty good buying guide.  I would also suggest doing a search for a plumbing wholesaler or plumbing supply store in your area.  The people there are probably much more qualified to walk you through it than anyone you see at one of the big box stores.My suggestion is to find a style that you like in a couple of different price points, check reviews online and then go from there.

"My experience with this is that there are a finite number of rattles, and that use of duct-tape either to make things that shouldn't move against each other not move (e.g.: grid intersections and hanging wires), or to pad and damp things that might still need to move (e.g.: grill damper) will completely fix the problem, but that it may take several iterations of fixing more things before all rattles and buzzes are removed. This pretty much can be done on the non-visible faces and surfaces of things.When you hear a rattle, listen for where it is and start pressing things to see what you need to tape up. Then tape it. Then listen for the next rattle . . . Yes, at one point in my life I *did* spend several hours a day practicing bass in a university practice room with a grid-ceiling. . . "
"My wife and I are looking for a dryer right. Based on consumer reviews, GE is better than Samsung when it comes to the $450-$550 price point. Exactly how it all shakes down in the long-run is a mystery, but I do know this: GE has more affordable low-end options than Samsung.Other notes:1. Sears will tell you three out of four homes have Kenmore. When I asked the Sears guy if Kenmore was better than GE, he couldn't say.2. Sears' warranties are far more expensive than Home Depot's. Sears quoted me $135 for a three-year warranty on a $499 dryer. Home Depot quoted me $75 for the same dryer.3. Sears will upcharge you if you want your dryer delivered during a particular time frame. The only free delivery option they provide is the one for which you choose a day of deliver but not the time."
"So when I say that I want to ""finish"" the basement, I'm not meaning that I want to put up drywall and make it into a real room. The farthest my ideas have gone so far is for it to be a workshop and to wall off (with plenty of access) the steam boiler, hot water heater, and furnace so those wouldn't get damaged by sawdust, etc. And to clean up and repaint the walls.From all of the answers here, it's apparent that even though it's mostly dry, all of the walls probably have moisture issues that I need to deal with eventually. For now though, can I scrape and clean the walls and repaint them? If so, what type of paint should I be looking for?I'll also get a couple of quotes for fixing the moisture issues, but I have other higher priority projects right now, so that's going to have to wait."
"&gt;I feel like no matter what I do, I will be stuck working for the rest of my life. It feels like the system is tailored so that everybody will have to work as many hours as possible as many days as possible until they are dead. I remember working before computers and cell phones and the internet were all that widespread. We work the exact same number of hours then we did before computers were around. All this incredible level of productivity increase, but Our Lives didn't improve at all. Plane don't understand. What was all this progress for? If not to benefit people's quality of life? We're all just supposed to spend our entire existence in servitude? Generation after generation? My grandfather, my father, myself, and my children, my grandchildren? What the hell is the point of living if our lives don't belong to us?Just wanted to let you know you're not alone; there are others who sympathize with you and who won't just tell you to ""man up"" or some BS bootlicker nonsense like some of the (thankfully downvoted) comments in this thread."
"I would love to replace the vanity. In the interest of the budget it's going to stay for now. I am hoping I find an incredible deal, for example at a Habitat for Humanity ReStore. I am hoping we can at least remove the vanity to tile underneath, then put it back, so in the future it is easier to upgrade without worrying about the tile work. I don't know how feasible it is, I haven't had time to take a good look at it. It's built pretty well and I love the centered drawers. I agree with the ideas for half walls and rebuilding them as such. Nooks are always a good thing to have. I would love to move the plumbing to the back wall! I don't know why it was ever put on the left side of the shower like that. Same thing for the tub.The window needs to be replaced due to condensation inside but that cost is not in the budget right now. I will probably be using cling film for privacy. Decorating around it will be pretty easy - we can add shelves and hang plants. I have plenty of orchids - They would love the filtered light and humidity.Thanks! "
"No need for a Nest - I don't think the thermostat is your problem. If I understand correctly, you don't want your boiler running all the time. It shouldn't be! If your boiler is running all the time, then it is probably undersized for the space or climate. The thermostat in a hydronic system does not decide (directly) when to cycle the boiler on and off. That is dictated by an internal control loop which maintains water at a constant temp, as someone else explained. The thermostat (Nest or any other variety) only dictates when to pump the hot water into the radiators. The more water that gets pumped through the radiators, the more often your boiler will cycle on. You definitely don't want to start controlling the cycling yourself as this will lead to over and underheating the water, which could be disastrous. Have your heating bills changed recently? Oil or gas? If you invest in anything, I would recommend having a service technician come out. You should do this every single year without fail for an oil system. Every two years for gas. "
"You all need to get the book 'Everybody Poops'.After 4 kids, my wife hasn't pooped alone in the bathroom in about 12 years now.Side story:Wife and I met and dated for 2 straight weeks.  I knew I was going to marry her at that point and asked her 6 months later.  6 months after that and we have been married 16 wonderful years now.We lived together before marriage, I moved into her 1 br apartment at about month 4 of dating.  Ended up getting the flu.  Not some 'stomach flu' 24 hour bug.  This was the flu that is *the flu*.  the one that makes you sure you would be better off dead than having to feel this way a second longer.Anyway, she was nursing me back to health, and on the 2nd day into the sickness I shat her bed.No joke.  Shat the fucking bed like a baby.She helped me into the tub, cleaned up everything and never said a fucking word.I realized later how special she was and I knew that I was making the right decision wanting to marry her.Anyway, TL;DR:Get over it.  Everybody poops.  Trying to 'hide' it is just silly."
"I gutted our home to the studs, room-by-room. New drywall everywhere (except a few ceilings). Everything new. New electric, new insulation, new siding (new sheathing in some places), etc. Everything is documented very well and all work was done with permits. If we ever sell the house a home inspector will probably faint when he/she sees the level of documentation we have. Everything is documented. Who did what, when, why, etc. All permit numbers (and paper copies), etc. in a 3-ring binder (and USB stick) for anyone to see. This house has no secrets. Only thing I'm not proud of is roughly 3-feet of old electric wire I had to abandon (wasn't worth the effort to get it out) in one section of wall. Every other inch of the home is essentially a new construction home that was built in 1955. Documented homes are rare but they do exist. I even went so far as to document (with photos and tape measure in pics) what is inside every wall. I have pics and measurements of everything: where all the in-wall blocking is (for ADA compliance as well as stupid stuff like stud bay in bathroom where you hang towel rack or TP holder), where all the nail plates are in the studs --and what is running where (wire, plumbing, etc.). I even drew up where the studs are and which wall to start from to get to 16""OC. "
"This type of vent is called an air admittance valve. It is a one-way valve that allows air in to replace water when it drains. It does not allow sewer gas out, unless it is broken. If it is, you simply replace it with a new one. In some areas, such as Minnesota, these valves are not allowed by code. You'd have to check with your local building regulations if you care. However, they are still being sold even where not allowed by code so people are using them anyway. Generally speaking, they are a perfectly valid way to vent a plumbing drain. The only condition for a house is that at least one plumbing vent goes out the roof to the exterior. So if your house does not have a single plumbing vent to the exterior, then technically your repair guy is correct and you should have a plumbing vent run to the outside. However, if you have at least one roof plumbing vent and the AAV works fine, then ignore what he said. From your photo it looks like there is a P-trap on the drain line as required. The water in that P-trap is what prevents sewer gas from going up the drain pipe into the laundry room. So if that is indeed a P-trap, then again, ignore what he said. [Here is a great article and video about AAVs](https://structuretech1.com/air-admittance-valves/) from a home inspector's perspective.

"I install shower glass for a living. Why are you removing it, are you re-tiling it? If so, itü__s going to be tough to keep the same dimensions to reuse the glass (depending on how much play you have in the channel). If you do decide to go forward with it, the channel should be screwed in to the tile so youü__re gonna have to remove the glass from the channel or risk damaging your tile. To do this, you want a long razor blade to slide between the glass and channel. I donü__t know where youü__d find one- I get mine from a wholesale glass distributor but Home Depot or a paint supply store may have one also. You need one long enough to fish in between the glass and channel without scratching the visible portion of the glass. The silicone SHOULD only be on the interior, shower side of the channel. After running this a few times, you should be able to carefully pull the glass out of the channel. Obviously, start with the panel next to the door and then work on the return panel. As another commenter said, the smart move would be to have a reputable glass company tear it out and reinstall but as I said, if you plan on re-tiling, thereü__s a solid chance it may not fit after the new tile is installed. With that said, I would never do this as I would assume liability for the glass for such a low profit margin so beware anyone who says they can pull it out and reinstall it for you with no problems. They may run into issues and if they do, they probably will not stand behind it and make it right. I guess the biggest question is why tear it out? "

"I had to get rid of a couple old clothes line posts when I bought my house too. The first one was pretty easy. The second one, not so easy at all. I ended up using ratchet straps wrapped around a tree to get it out. It had a mushroom head at the bottom holding it in and was about 3' deep."
"I see this a lot, and it usually means the ceiling was wet at one time. Can't tell in the image, but if the drywall gets wet enough, it'll also sag a bit between fasteners, and/or you'll be able to see where each fastener is. Roof might have been replaced and the moisture issue is gone."
"I see, and the nails you're talking about here... ""enough flex to get a cats paw in to pull the nails."" are the nails holding the rake/facia board to the 2x4 supports? You're not talking about the drip edge nails. So in other words, leave the drip edge intact, just bend it out of the way?"
"I thought it'd be having this discussion yesterday. hehe[From Merriam-Webster:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electrocute) &gt;  to kill **or severely injure** by electric shock Edit: Man, it bugs me when people delete their posts the moment it looks like they're wrong."
I understand that the thermostat only gives power below the desired temperature but does the thermostat actually turn the space heater back on when it dips below the desired temperature? How can it do that? Don't you need to press the button? I'm not sure just giving it power turns it on.
"I used American Lighting 3LC LED strips.  They were easy to install, dimmable and have a few settings for the tone of white light.  They do require a transformer, but I only needed one for three strips, and it is thin/easily mounted under the cabinet next to the first strip in the series."
"I used my builder's recommended inspector, first time buying a house. Somehow he missed that all of the insulation in the attic was piled on one side of the house.We were trying to figure out why the house was so hot, got a ladder and saw the insulation.Always get your own inspector."
"I'm no expert, but since it's a recessed light it looks like you have to pinch 2 springs and pull it out of its housing. It's different than just unscrewing and screwing in another lightbulb.Again, no expert, just what I'm seeing from the photos and just having recessed lighting put in."
"If I had to guess, at one point the ceilings were sagging and these braces were put in to add some support.  They would have put in a temporary wall below to flatten the ceiling, then installed the supports in the attic. If you don't have any waves/sags in your ceiling you should be fine."
"If it is permitted, you can sell the house with the increased square footage.  If it is not permitted, you can call it a bonus room, but it will be counted as *livable* square footage.  That is the operative word, and the difference between the two could be $10,000, $15,000, or even more."
"If the inside drywall doesn't have anything wrong with it then leave it. Since you said its next to the garage it's like that for a firebreak per code. Typically you need 5/8"" for drywall firebreak, they probably just doubled up on 1/2"" which is better. Will help with the noise a bit too."
"If you have a basement, you most likely need a dehumidifier and a humidity monitor. Typically in fall to early spring you don't need to run it but always base it on humidity. I keep a target of 45% and in winter, I will run a humidifier as it gets to the 23% level which is too dry for me."
It kept the rats warm in winter too. It's fixed now.  It was a relatively simple vent run too. Only took me an hour. Just sheer laziness. This house is full of shit like that. So much so that I've delayed Reno plans until I fix all this piddly shit.  This is the house of a thousand cuts. 
"It will be on a stand (though I actually don't have to patch the walls for a TV mount I still prefer the flexibility of a stand for rearranging the room later.)The Ecobee is sounding pretty good from the other comments I've got, so I'll have to check it out more thoroughly.  Thanks.  :)"
"Itü__s not likely that itü__s a fire block, they arenü__t required unless the wall is over 10ü__ tall. Probably just a block. They donü__t do all that much unless theyü__re part of a shear wall. If the wall has plywood on it then donü__t take out the block. No plywood, ok to take it out. "
"Iü__ll take the downvotes, but itü__s a serious question. I was taught to use an ohmmeter (resistance setting on multimeter) to test for continuity. Iü__m genuinely asking if there is another way, beside the obvious method of putting a load on the circuit and seeing if the current flows. "

"My understanding is that the surfactants and degreasers in soaps can negatively affect bonding of the shingles and lead to early failure. The hose-end mounted moss killers are about diluting the concentrate and distributing it over the roof surface, there's no physical removal involved."
"Now *that* is a little more reasonable solution :-P And sorry if I kinda pissed in your Corn Flakes with my comment. This was one of those ideas that sound cool that people *reeeeally* try to justify and just find a way to get it done no matter what... but it just wouldn't end well :-/."
"Oh I'm sure that you're not the only one either. It's just that the warranty replacement shit at Home Depot and whatnot when I worked there was like 50% samsung at LEAST. It's just a gamble that's not worth it.I'm glad yours are working out man. I really am. Appliance repair suuuuucks. "

"Set the Fan Min On Time to X mins/hr. Turn the system ""OFF"". The EcoBee will divide X into equal intervals within the hours and run the fan. This doesn't allow you to control the fan independently, but it does allow the fan to distribute air throughout the house without conditioning it."
"Sounds like you're into groundwater.  Any plugs will be bandaids, and the water will find another route into your basement. If you plug it and it doesn't work, I would consult with a civil engineer who deals with stormwater, they will have a better idea of how to permanently fix this.  "
That looks like a pancake box.  Why isn't it attached to the structure?  Why is there a hole in the ceiling that looks like the box would fit in there?  If that box fits into that hole in the ceiling is there more wire available that the sheathing can be stripped off and put into the box?
The next thing to check is to make sure there isnü__t something blocking the air inlet for the pilot or that the air shutter itself (if there is one on the pilot) didnü__t get knocked out of adjustment. An orange flame is an indicator of not enough oxygen. The flame should be solid blue. 
"We need more info on your sump pump! There's no point in installing foundation drainage without a functional sump pump.That said, any sump pump operates at its best when its connected to foundation drains.If water is coming up through your floor is it not coming up into your sump pit?"
"We use an ecobee. Our house (in Texas) has a 12 year old A/C and 35 year old windows, but our electric bill is about half of most of our neighbors, even those with much newer energy-efficient units.  I feel like the ecobee does a lot to keep our A/C usage as low and efficient as possible."
"What smart thermostat allows the temp to drop that low?My ecobee has a minimum for it's every day use, and another minimum for ""vacation mode"". It's hard for me to believe that ""smart"" thermostats would allow your house to get so cold that pipes would burst, that's just crazy to me!"
"Ya. That's probably a decent price. I wouldn't expect much less tbh. Find out how much they want to sand it tho. That's necessary and it's better if they make a mistake than you..... They'll fix it better. Typically that's included in a scope like this. Make sure it's done before paint."
"You are correct.We always suggest on this sub that you get multiple quotes.  Maybe 120K is all you need.  But at least two other companies should be quoted to see if they agree with this assessment.Heating is a competitive industry.  Do yourself a favor and get more estimates, please."
"You can download copies of the assembly instructions from their website. That will give you a much clearer idea of how theyü__re put together and what what comes with something when you buy it.Itü__s a very good system and the door and drawer hardware is very high quality made by Blum. "
"You can. It's a bit of work, but quite doable. Carefully remove the broken tile. Scrape the mastic/thinset off and clean all the grout off. Make sure the tile fits. Put new mastic/thinset in so the tile will be the right height and set it. Wait till it's dry and grout with matching grout."
"Youü__d have to do some research Iü__m honestly not all that familiar with it and donü__t even know if you could do it on tile floors. Iü__m thinking you canü__t but you could always check with some companies. From what I understand, yes, the color and finish can be changed by reglazing. "

"Do you have access to the bottom and side of the tub with the drain pipes?Your best option is going to be to buy a bath tub drain kit and replace it all.  The overflow, the opening up on the side, normally has a washer or foam gasket on the outside of the tub to keep it from leaking.  The same goes for the drain in the bottom of the tub, some drain kits also want the flange that goes in from the top siliconed in.As is I would be worried that the gaskets have shifted and even if you reinstalled the existing drain hardware it could leak."
"Gambrel with a loft would be my choice. It's often not legal(codes vary considerably), but concrete floor is ideal. Nice prefab kits are available.

I'm spoiled though, I got free pallet racks, and I had lots of restaurant shelving. http://imgur.com/ogftxYpPallet racks and smaller versions of them(gorilla racks) is superior shelving.

"I can't believe running an air compressor would be cheaper than whatever heat you already have.  Even straight electric heat (usually considered among the most expensive options) would be cheaper, because you won't be wasting energy compressing air uselessly.  And you're using a device not meant for the job, which means it's likely to fail.Yes, I think this is an extremely farfetched plan.  I doubt my saying so will do any good, though.  I'm just some random guy on the internet.You should totally post this to /r/hvac...they'll love it."
"I had this problem in my old house several years ago. Usually around 1-2 a.m. the pipes would start lightly hammering about 4x a second. Drove me nuts and I went all over the house turning off valves, powering down the hot water heater etc. - no luck. I found that turning off the valve from the street would make the problem go away so it seems there was some oscillation coming from the city water supply.rcrracer's solution worked for me - a new expansion tank next to my water heater absorbed the vibrations and made the hammering go away."
"I have tried so many different software kitchen tools and they all suck. I would roughly sketch out what you want on paper, then research the cabinets you want. Ask the cabinet company if they have a tool that works with their cabinets. IKEA has theirs. It is free and you can use it to approximate other cabinets if you do not use ikea but it will not give you a full list of all the parts you need. I went with barker cabinets and there is a 3rd party software package for laying out the kitchen but only worked for a 30day trial license. "
"I used plans from the Missouri department of conservation.  Placed two about 15' up on the south side of the house.  They found them on their own.  It's a very safe location as snakes cannot climb up or down to the bat houses.  The roof overhang is six feet on the south side of the house.  Often a midwinter warm spell will bring them to the houses.On those days I often get full body sun on the south porch.  I can hear them chirping away in there.  Imagine they are talking about how glad they are to get out of that dank cave.  Yadda yadda"
"In all fairness, a good solid roof should be able to handle a power washer. I do it every few years on our cabin's roof to get rid of the moss. Never a leak, shingles never flip up (I'm obviously careful not to point it upwards under the shingles). It's a 3 dimensional roof too.However, we finally bit the bullet and installed a zinc strip along the whole roof. This is a great moss repellent. Wish we did that right away! A lot of cabins in the area do the same.Edit: just realized OP has a tile roof. I was talking about asphalt shingles."
"It actually isn't. I mean, obviously it is equal when you're measuring the fan in a particular installation, but assuming that the same fan will pull the same amount of air when it's installed on the pull end of the duct as it will on the push end of the duct is definitely not guaranteed. Aerodynamics is a complicated topic, but fans are usually designed and rated specifically for one type of installation or the other. The difference is pretty marginal, and not particularly relevant in this kind of situation, but technically it does exist."
"Man, that's a tough one. That's less than 3 sq ft installed. We've just put in about that much marble and travertine. The stone tile is actually the cheapest part but installation is expensive. Some of the marble we actually got for less than 2 sq ft. It holds up extremely well to dogs too as long as you keep it sealed. I've had really bad experience with wood, engineered and solid with dogs and I just hate carpet. I'm guessing vinyl is your best bet unless you can find some really cheap stone and have the tools and know how to put it in. "
"Not an expert but what exactly is the issue? From your description it sounds like they are proposing a solution to the issue (which I'm sure they don't want to do because of money) My property doesn't have an easement but the adjoining property carries the power-lines which power the island were I live. 2 years ago the power company asked me if they could use my property to get into the woods to cut down growth underneath the wires. I agreed because I didn't see how it harmed me, they kicked up some ruts in the swamp but it was fine by me."
"Solar incentives vary by state. Disire.org (someone please correct my url?)  I live in the Midwest and have solar on the roof (owned) with a 10 year payback. A big part of the decision for us is the fact that in the Midwest, a big part of electricity production is from coal. People *die* at an increased rate due to air pollution caused by coal (and vehicle and industrial sources)To be fair, we also put in $1-2k of attic insulation and air sealing, which is critical to reduce energy usage and very coat effective in just about any home.

"Trust your nose. if you've narrowed it down, but unplugged everything and the ozone smell is still there...next go for the electrical breaker that controls all the sink/under sink outlets and leave it off for 1+ hours. Air the place out again, and retest with your nose. If it's gone!?!? Then your assumption is correct! There might be a leak in the wall dripping on an outlet or worse. Still a fire hazard. If the ozone smell stays, continue your electrical isolation area by area till you find it, then report it to the electrician. Good luck!"
"What might work for you is to break the work up into smaller pieces.  Maybe you want the kitchen of your dreams, but the huge price tag is preventing you from moving forward. That's O.K.  We've all been there.  Start with one item only.  Get quotes for just removing the single wall that is pissing you off.  Nothing else.  Then once that is done, get quotes for the plumbing or the electrical.  You get the idea.  It takes a bit longer doing this piecemeal, but in the end you accomplish exactly the same thing.  And with less stress, as well."
"Where I live, underground gas line is usually polyethylene tubing that's welded together.

"Home inspectors often are jack of all trades, master of maybe one. If you're lucky, they're an ex-builder and will pick up on more than standard. But even ex-builders will still miss plenty of things.If you really wanted a thorough report you'd want to get a consult with a person from virtually every trade round to check things out. And that'd be insanely expensive. Hence why there are ""home inspectors"" which if you're lucky will catch most of the basic pitfalls. But don't expect them to be knowledgeable in most trades, particularly anything pertaining to foundation or structural.u/arizona-lad has given you some solid advice there and probably will in the future - he's a common sight on posts around this sub. Dude's the real jack of all trades, 'home inspectors' aint got shit on him :P "
"I should mention it is against code here to use wood as the curb.. I believe in USA for pan liners you're supposed to use chicken wire and mud up over the curb as well.I really don't like pan liners as the mud is a mildew heaven and adds a lot more area for moisture to wick through as it be constantly saturated. The photos I linked use high density foam with a plastic coating, although my preference is volcanic ash paver that I slice up with the wetsaw to 65x55mm lengths. (doesn't compress and impossible to accidentally damage) Wood has a tendency to warp and split the waterproofing membrane if it's not bolted extremely well into the floor.Aerated concrete block are also commonly used, and many tilers purchase 100x200mm bricks that they then glue down prior to forming the mud pan.

"Iü__ve had my house for almost two years &amp; did have to have major foundation work done. As the seasons changes, I still get doors that will suddenly start sticking more or less depending on temperature &amp; moisture. This is perfectly normal. I strongly suggest giving it a full year so you know how your house changes before trying to repair anything. The one thing I did have to do was take a palm sander to the tops of some of the interior doors so that they would actually close. I also put some spacers (ie. pieces of cardboard) between the hinges &amp; door frame on my front door to help make it close at a better angle, but for the most part everything will probably be fine: you just have to ride out the year of learning &amp; then youü__ll understand your houseü__s seasonal shifts.

"My garage door had the same problem and it caused the gear in my opener to break/wear out. You can buy a replacement gear kit for $15 but the right thing to do is to have it torsion properly.I know a lot of people advised against DIY it yourself but honestly if you're careful it's not difficult to do at all. I think table saws  are way more dangerous and there are more injury with table saw than any other tools. Just look up youtube and there are plenty of tutorials showing you how to do it properly and safely. Or you can hire someone to come and charge you $100 for 15min of work.Edit: In my situation, the spring just needed to be adjusted 2 quarter turns. It took me longer to get the ladder setup and getting things prepped. Probably took a whole 1 minute to do the actual turning part. "
"What we do on all new builds in basements:-Poly from grade down under the walls, have the poly acoustical sealed to the concrete about 6 inches above grade.-Poly and acoustical the concrete right at the top of the concrete and wrap over top of the framing wall.-Frame 2x4 wall 6ü_ù from foundation and batt with R20 getting insulation behind each stud as well-Poly front face connecting the top and bottom poly-DrywallYou should not need poly across the area of concrete above grade, at least we donü__t here. The biggest reason for moisture is frost coming through the concrete in winter. Frost will not come through above grade as it only comes through the ground. We typically spray foam the pockets between each joist but you would have to insulate and poly each space to seal it off."
"Wow, you're so misinformed I'm not sure where to even start. The only reason I am continuing this conversation is because I do not want others to be misinformed. I do not touch my thermostat, ever. It knows when someone is home by either presence detection of me or my girls phone, or by detecting motion when you walk down the hallway. This means that when I get home it knows I'm home, so even though its isn't scheduled for ac to be on it turns on the ac because it knows someone is now home. That is clearly a huge benefit, it is also efficient because it knows when nobody is home as well. When nobody is home for my set duration it goes into eco mode to save energy.Fair enough, for me the money has been well worth it. For what it's worth, my final price into the thermostat was about 75 bucks. I obviously understand what I am talking about, I did my research before purchase and now use the product. You may see it as overpriced, but in the summer months our ac was on for 140 hours in a *single* month, I will take an extra efficiency I can. "
"I have no idea why it's like that. Maybe the walls of this nook were positioned differently before? Like that used to be the back wall?They came to install it yesterday. I didn't think it would be an issue, so I wasn't there (we had a relative open up the apartment for them instead). Apparently they didn't even bother bringing up the appliances. They just took the measurements and said ""nope"". They said that either 1) we'd have to have an electrician and plumber open up the walls and reconfigure everything, or 2) re-select appliances.1. We really don't want to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to open up the walls.2. We really don't want to downsize our appliances (we're going to have to buy what we JUST sold)Apparently they also took a look at the extension cord we bought and said, ""that's not going to work"". It clearly says it's for appliances, and it's rated to 15 amps (the washer is 10 amps), so I don't understand what the problem is.I spoke to the Best Buy ""In-Home Sales Manager"" and sent him the pictures of the area. He said he'll take a look at it after his appointments. But he's standing by the installer's claim. ""All they do is install appliances every day. They're smarter than you. They're smarter than me. If they say that it can't be installed, I'm going to trust them."""

"Ah, it definitely has a slot for an overflow on the drain pipe but the sink doesn't have a spot for one. The sink came with a faucet so I'll check that to see if there's anything I can use from it. otherwise I guess I'll try to find a generic drain pipe that matches the size of the flange."

I agree with that completely.  What I'm not sure about is how transparent this whole process should be. I don't like to be in the dark and I feel like this is kind of a black hole.  I'm wondering how detailed the scope of work on a project like this should be before officially signing on.

"I think you might need to figure out why your windows are so leaky to begin with. They shouldn't be getting cold enough that you're getting all that condensation. You may need to look into installing storm windows... if they're getting that cold, you're losing a *lot* of heat through them."
"I would consider looking into a lumber yard and having them deliver. Lumber yards have vastly better quality wood, and often deliver for cheep. My local yard only charges 40 bucks to deliver, and home depot charges 75 bucks.At 40 bucks its not much more expensive then renting the truck. "
I would look for a fiberglass option. I had them installed in my old house and found them superior to vinyl and metal for a few reasons. Fiberglass is stronger than vinyl so youü__ll get les frame and more glass. It doesnü__t sag or flex and wonü__t transfer temperature the way metal does.

It's generally considered a matter of taste/style how the ceilings of a room are painted. Some people like the ceiling painted the same color as the room but I've always painted ceilings flat ceiling white to reflect light and help brighten up the room regardless of the color of the walls.

Thank you! The subfloor is good. Already did the John Bridge deflection calculation and added 1/2 inch plywood over the existing 3/4 inch subfloor. This stuff I think is going to be my saving grace in keeping the height of the tile down as low as possible next to 3/4 inch hardwood floors.

The 1100 cfm would work better.   Your local building codes may have specs set for the btu output of the range and may require a specific cfm for the hood and may require a make up air system.  I would recommend having a qualified contractor assess  the situation to get the right answers. 
The current 90 degree bends appear to be only for the purpose of going through the joist (right turn) and then back toward the exterior wall (left turn). If they continued going straight toward the exterior wall without going through the joist there shouldn't be a need for 90 degree turns.
The paint should be ok with a good mix but I'd still go to the paint shop to get another can mixed up. I Australian paint shops they print off a sticker with the exact base  and formula they used and attach it to the can so you can easily get more of the same mixed with highest accuracy.  
The right thing would be hydraulic water-stop. However I am also very concerned about that Poly adapter and I would recommend you consider replacing the water line penetration with different pipe and get the joint further away from the wall. Also that adapter is  illegal inside a building.

"Along with these measures, add a pin lock to the sliding portion.

"How old is the house?  Are there any cracks in a wall or just in the ceilings?  I have seen cracks in drywall due to a foundation settling, but there are also normally cracks around the corners of windows and doors and where the walls meet the ceiling.I wouldn't be too worried unless other cracks start forming or if you start having issues with doors and windows not opening and closing correctly like they used to.  Those are the first indications of foundation settling issues, also in my area its common for houses to settle for a year or so after they are first built, but an existing decades old home thats starting to settle is an issue.To me, it looks like it could just be a bad job at patching the cracks and it is failing.  Or patches opeing back up because the house is settling again."
"If the panel is that loose, thereü__s no way to get a permanent fix. - as long as the panel moves like that, anything you do will just crack.  The panel should be removed so that you can get some kind of blocking in behind, then attach the panel to that blocking.

If itü__s solid wood, seasonal contraction and expansion will crack the paint in the seam.  In that case, you need to paint the panels separately, but you could try to do a bit of coping at the panel edge (like when you install baseboard or crown moulding - Ask This Old House has some great videos) to hide the seam as best as possible."

"My house was built in the mid 60s; it's around 2400 sq ft, with _maybe_ 70 sq ft of closet space. It's infuriating once you realize just how much stuff you can stash in a more modern home.We've basically done the same thing. Bedframe with underbed storage, a chest at the foot of the bed for blankets, we have a total of 3 dressers in our bedroom, the guest bed is a day bed with underbed storage. We filled out the breakfast nook in our kitchen with new cabinets, make use of storage cubes in various places. My office desk is simple with a bunch of cabinets with drawers under it. TV stand gas storage, our living table has a shelf under it to stash a few things. Ended up getting a slightly larger China cabinet to store table linens in as well.Really makes you appreciate a well designed house."
"This may seem obvious, but measure your space and map it out before buying furniture.   My previous house was 530 square feet - before I moved in I measured every room and made a sketch on graph paper, made little furniture paper dolls and figured out the most reasonably sized furniture I could use.I also searched for pieces that do double duty; a couple of IKEA armoires back-to-back created a wall/divider and gave me two closets where there had been none.   Underbed storage.  Storage ottoman...nothing purely decorative that just takes up space.   Weirdly, I've just moved into a house 4x the size of my tiny home and I'm finding myself aggravated on a daily basis at how illogically set up all of this ""space"" is...everything is too big and there's less storage than I had in my tiny house!"
"&gt;Well, I noticed the cabinets and drywall are built right on the concrete.That's probably not the case. On exterior masonry walls, drywall is typically hung on [furring strips](https://hotbitt.com/furring-strips-market-2018-2023-analysis-major-playersstimson-lumber-companyuniversal-forest-products-inc-and-more/), which are thin pieces of lumber screwed or nailed to the block. There will usually be some sort of plastic sheet moisture barrier, then a bit of insulation, then the drywall layer. Think about it - if the drywall was mounted directly on the block walls, there would be nowhere for the electrical to go. And the amount of work needed to drive masonry fasteners to hang drywall is immense - no drywall crew would deal with that hassle. &gt;And in a closet where the flooring stops, the concrete is visible there, too. It looks like the laminate floor and drywall are directly on the slab throughout the house....that's how laminate floors are installed. There is underlayment &amp; a moisture barrier between the laminate &amp; slab. "
"FYI - This is something I did in my house, and it took weeks of vacation time to complete.  It took me 5 years (off and on) to get it all done, but that was because I had a small child so couldn't do any when she was home, and had to have things cleaned up before she came back from daycare.  The staining and varnishing was fine, but the sanding took a very long time.  You house will be very messy while you are sanding.  No matter how much you try to limit the dust to one area, it will get on everything.I had some very damaged areas, so I ended up buying some new oak baseboard in a very similar profile, put that in an inconspicuous area (alcove in the dining room that houses our hutch), stained to match, and used the removed original baseboard to replace damaged boards in more visible areas.  I looked at getting custom made, but the set up cost made the cost prohibitive for the small amount I needed.I don't (really) regret doing it. It ended up looking great, but it was way more work that I had expected, and I thought I was overestimating."
"Honestly, if you can swing it, pay a professional cleaning service to come do all the surfaces. It's subtle, but profound, the way sparking windows, nice smooth baseboards, clean windowframes all add up to a feeling of lightness and peace. Plus, clean surfaces can be easily *dusted* to stay clean; rough grundgy ones have to be wiped or scrubbed, which we tend to avoid more. Home services have high-power vacs and bunches of attachments that make getting into window frames or up along ceiling trim much faster and easier than we can do, ditto floor scrubbers/buffers -- and all of this is WAY faster/cheaper when the house is empty.  The other thing: look at your ceilings and the tops of the walls. Does everything join without any dark shadowy seams? Have all the meeting-places been caulked before painting? This is going to sound weird if you've never seen a before-after, but a well-done upper part of a room sends back lots of nice light; one with open seams has lots of little dark slits of shadow, and the overall effect is truly noticeable."
Yeah I did not anticipate the slope to be a problem.  I expected AAA Fence to do the job properly from the get go as I sent out my bids to several companies in my area.  They came out ahead by price matching the competition and explicitly stating that they want to get their name in the neighborhood (a somewhat exclusive community).  However with this shoddy work im kind of appalled that they went this route without consulting me or the sale's rep that came out and measured.  Nope... just install with ordered materials and ditch once finished (thats what they did).   Luckily I only paid them for materials and the remaining balance I will hold them up for.   Funny I received two emails from the sales team and the VP asking me how I like their fence and to review them on their website.  I laughed... sent them the picture of the fence and I get a ring later on from the sales guy wanting to meet with me next week to see how best to resolve this...   One side of me wants to contact the VP directly and ask them what HE can do to make this right!?   
"1. Egress window will only need to be installed if you are pulling permits and making it livable space (i.e. bedrooms, etc.).  While I can't speak to your area's code, I am doing pretty much this exact same thing, finishing half my basement, relocating washer/dryer into finished space, workout area, and play room area.  I pulled permits and clearly specified that this will not be livable space used to rent out or anything like that, so I am not required to have 2 points of egress.2. I would consider things like wiring for the future, for example, TV /cable outlets if you want to add a TV to your workout room, a dedicated jack for a treadmill or something like that, closet space if you can fit it is always nice and great for resale.3. There is almost always potential for flooding in basements, as well as a constant battle with moisture.  I found that rigid foam adhered to the concrete walls for insulation in addition to batt insulation in the studs is helpful.  I used the rigid XPS foam as a vapor barrier as well.  Consider flooring, many people use life proof vinyl or other setups that are suited to moisture rather than something like carpet or hardwood.  Plan for smoke detectors as well, the fire department requires them.  If you are hard wired throughout your whole house, you will likely need to hard wire the smoke detector in the basement as well (again, if you are pulling permits).  If you do decide you want to make this livable/rentable space, then you will need to have 2 points of egress.  These are just some things I've picked up."
"So of course get multiple quotes, but, assuming what you want done actually costs that much, here's my advice:It comes down to a few things. If you think you're going to live in that house the rest of your life, then you have to decide if that price is acceptable to you. Would spending that 100k make living in that house that much better? This really comes down to a number of things, and I can't tell you what the answer is.If you're not planning on living there the rest of your life, how much is this going to increase the value of your house? It may help to talk to someone who knows real estate, and also check out comps in your neighborhood. If your house is worth 200k, and most houses in your neighborhood sell for 150k right now, adding a top of the line kitchen probably isn't going to get you even 30% return on investment. If other houses in the area are selling for 400k you might have some better luck and get something like 75% (been a while since I looked, I think kitchens have the highest ROI for home improvement at around 3/4 to full depending what was done, how long ago, etc... typically)So if you look at a 75% return on investment, you can at least tell yourself for that 100k you're adding 75k in equity into your home. Now, this number could grow or shrink depending on how the market does, but either way likely would be worth more with the kitchen redone than not. So at that point you have to consider is that worth it to you? You're taking 100k liquid assets, and converting it to 75k home equity, and 25k sunk for the cost of the kitchen (again, rough ballpark, could only be like 20k home equity depending on your area and what you do. If you paint everything neon pink that plays a siren when you close the cabinet its probably not going to add anything to the value of your house)"

As /u/ImALittleTeapotCat pointed out a plumber should be able to snake it if there is a clog.  That's likely all it is.  If that doesn't resolve it a plumber can also run a camera in there to see what's going on.  Unless the pipe is actually damaged they shouldn't have to cut into anything.

I just picked up a ratcheting screwdriver with storage for 12 bits( really 6 but they are double sided for different sizes) has been great just for the fact that I only have to worry about carrying one rather than guess the correct size that I'll need or have to carry multiple screwdrivers.

"If you look up from this photo you will probably see why. There is an upper roof that water needs to drain off of.Whether they should've continued this downspout all the way to the lower level is a question of time, aesthetics, money, and other priorities. You could extend it if you want."
Itü__s a large hill that has a retaining wall about 4 feet high behind the house. The retaining wall looks to be about 100+ years old as well.  Maybe some dirt naturally settled to fill the area near the house- but not 6 feet worth. Maybe a mudslide long ago? Old houses are full of mystery!

"Oh, the vinyl will want a very very flat surface. If your deck was flat enough to qualify you probably wouldn't be looking at other flooring options.So, yes, installing a plywood subfloor or getting the room down to the slab and then flattening the slab are probably your two best options."
"Or invest in the Great Stuff gun. I've had the same can attached to it for the better part of a year, and as long as I shoot some every 30 days and clean the tip, it stays useable. Maybe not worth it to everyone, but it was $50 well spent in my case. I lend it out to neighbors all the time."

"SOme of those spouts are push-on, others use a set screw into the bare copper pipe, and others require a sweated-on copper male adapter (of just the right length). Look/feel underneath for a set screw, if not, try pulling while twisting counter clockwise. Once removed, you'll figure it out."
"So the burn rate can depend on your fireplace a little bit, but I'd say between 6-8in diameter would last through the night pretty well. Really the bigger it is the longer it'll burn, so even if you get two large-ish logs on there it'll last pretty long and should make it through the night."
"Summer cottages often have a supply water drain at the lowest point in the system, and you can drain the hot water side using the drain on the heater tank.Putting some RV antifreeze in the drain traps both keeps them from freezing, and from drying up and allowing sewer gas into the house."

The house Iü__m referring to was a fairly large one that was split down the middle and turned into 2 apartments and they added AC during the remodel. Later it was sold and they converted it back but I donü__t know much of what happened afterward. Was just an example of why this can happen. 
They have them hanging in the aisles by the insulation. I actually screwed large paint sticks to the joists then stapled the little R value card to it. One side of the paint stick was marked in inches so you could just screw them in and do the math if you canü__t find the little paper ones

"We had this installed this summer (we bought it but didnü__t want to tackle installing it ourselves). It is fine without an underlayment, although there are a couple of places we can feel that the subfloor has a tiny dip in it that probably would have been covered up by a cork underlayment."
"What I'm trying to find out is that is this an issue that could be resolved by a plumber or like a roofing company or something else? I know it's the weekend so we may not be able to do much but even if I could just get an idea of the best course of action, we could jump on it on Monday. "

"You can always ""brute force"" it, especially if you have good demo tools like a crowbar and a sawzall. But it will go a lot faster and cleaner if you look at how it's put together and try to take it apart in reverse. That usually means looking for screws or nails and removing them carefully."

You will want your poly sheet to overlap into the pan. In normal circumstances when I have a premade base I set the base then put the Hardibacker on so it sits right on the top of the flange. The tile will go on the Hardibacker and drop down over the flange and down to the pan very nicely.

"Can't believe I am wasting my time doing this, but:A 26gallon compressor probably draws just shy of 15A. A HF compressor draws 13.5A, so lets use that. Running on 110V, that is 1.485 kW. Running 24hours a day, 30 days a month would take just over 1000kWh. In the great state of Rhode Island, the average electric price right now is $0.144 per kWH. That would mean running the compressor would cost about an extra $150 per month. It will also probably not make your house warmer.TL;DR: You will see considerable ""lo$$e$"" and will still be cold."

"I think it honestly just depends on preference. I haven't heard much bad about porcelain tile, but one thing I have heard that may be something to take into consideration is future health stuff.

"Is the bladder in the same spot as the old bladder?  Most bladders only hold a small amount of water (anywhere from a couple gallons to 100+ gallons) and provide pressure for the system, usually when running a steady stream of water your pump is going to bring most of your water in.  If the bladder is in the same spot and it is NOT a conditioned space then I would look at your ground water temps with a handheld reader.  That or you might have really done something odd with your plumbing and leached into a hot water supply line for your cold."

Skip the tub. Put in a larger shower that has both a tall fixed shower head and a hand held one.  Tall people like to get all the way under the shower just like short people! The hand held is a life saver for cleaning the stall or washing your kid or dog off real quick. We also use the hand held to just wash our feet if weü__ve had sandals on all day and donü__t want to climb in bed with dirty feet. A nice large master shower that can accommodate a roll in wheel chair if necessary is a much bigger future selling point than a second bathtub.

"Yes, they can last much longer but the issue is the production cycle. As parts need to be replaced they won't be available 7 or 8 downs the line. They'll have cycled into a new model and stopped making parts for the old models.A unit like the Fleck 5600, the control head has been in production for 40+ years. It's the most ubiquitous control head in the US. Multiple different brands have used Fleck control heads. The current generation has updated timer and controls but the valving and pistons are the same parts used in the 40 y/o versions."
"You need to go down to the town and read the actual easement. There's not usually an offset from an easement that applies, it's what you can do with in that easement itself. Every conservation easement is different, allowing different things in different cases. Sometimes you can make no improvements above ground, sometimes you can put in place temporary structures, it all depends on the actual verbiage. Again, read it yourself thoroughly, because sometimes Town officials can be wrong in their assumptions of what restrictions are enforceable."
"&gt;So here is my issue: *My friends are telling me that I should be there while they paint.*Because...? The first day you'll meet them, walk through, confirm that you and the supervisor agree on the project. I'd check in that afternoon to make sure TV  and any furniture is covered. If the TV is wall mounted you should remove that yourself and make sure any cables attached to the walls are bundled and out of the way. If your smoke detectors aren't hardwired you may want to remove them just to make sure they paint under them (in my kitchen I had a big, white ring where they had not painted under the smoke detector which they had to touch up). After that I'd check in once a day just to make sure the colors are correct. Last day you'll do a walk through and report any issues to the supervisor."
"Everyone here is giving great recommendations like the soda traps, WD-40, soap and water, etc.However, if you're a big pussy like me that watches videos of people killing wasps for 5 hours as prep before manning up in three layers of clothes to go outside - The cans of wasp spray that spray from far away are the *perfect* choice.I tried the above methods to get rid of a hornets nest in the crack between my sidewalk, but they resulted in either not working, or having one lone wasp chase me around my backyard while my wife locked the door and laughed. I ended up buying the long spray, went outside at about 8pm and sprayed a bit from *very* far away into the crack and it worked like a charm.Sure, the can will cost you 8 bucks or so, and you'll likely use the whole can, but they're AWESOME."
"Spray foam is expensive that is undoubtedly true. But closed cell is some what water proof, you save time buy not needing a vapour barrier, and most of all it has an insane R value. I'm also in a zone 6 and I work in the industrial side of things. At my cost it is about 31-34 cents per sqft for pink r-12. About 2$ a sqft of an inch closed cell per sqft. So for you plan on eps (1.5 inch) plus r12 = 17.8r value at around $1.02 per sqftIf you want to spray foam closed cell is 2$ (including labour ps) for a 6.5r value. If you do it yourself it's about half the cost, but still far more expensive. I always recommend spray foam to people who are just filling a cavity but since you are an open basement and can start right from the foundation it only makes sense to go with ridgit and pink combo."
"Yes have done for one customer.  The mechanical work was done by an HVAC customer, and started with the need for a new HE natural gas furnace, which has an approximate cost of $5k installed here(all prices in $CDN).  He wanted to zone the house into 3 levels: basement, main and second, all about 1200 ft2, with each controlled by its own thermostat from a single furnace.  With that, he could shut down unoccupied floors with motorized dampers which were linked to the stats and a control panel. The main HVAC work was to change the ducting branch lines and install a motorized damper on each floor supply, before it went to room ducts., and coordinate all with the furnace off/on.  Aside from the new furnace(which was happenin anyway), the extra HVAC was about $10K.  On top of that, there was about $5k in extra drywall, carpentry and painting because t involved some demo work on two floors.  That number s kind of fluid because we took that opportunity to get rid of a lot of popcorn at the time. So, about $15k CDN in incremental cost-  maybe $11k US?"
"Rip out the tile. No matter how good it looks, the tile is not perfectly flat. It's very likely that any type of floating floor will **squeak** at the joins because the planks will move just a little bit. Even a tiny amount of movement will be enough to produce squeaks.I'm speaking from experience here. I have the exact same setup in my guest bathroom: ceramic tile installed directly on top of a concrete slab. The tile is solid. I installed luxury vinyl plank on top of the tile. I picked a top of the line brand (Torlys) that comes with an integrated cork underlayment. The floor looks great but it does squeak in many spots. Drives me crazy.ADDED: I bought vinyl plank in a small flooring store. The store has a great local reputation. When I went there, they were in the middle of installing *the same LVP product* on top of the tile in their showroom. So I guess it can be done. The catch is... they are pros with decades of experience. I don't know what kind of preparation they did to ensure quality installation.ADDED 2: The key variable is the size of the tile. The smaller the tile, the bigger potential there is for squeaks. It's hard to get *every* small tile in a room perfectly flat. The tile in my guest bath is small subway type (8"" x 4""). The tile in the business showroom was much larger."
"Your stairs are identical to mine! I've been learning to sand, fill gaps and make the walls and wood smoother. I have filled hundreds of holes. It just takes patience. I'm a 52 year old woman who has never done any wall or trim repair. If I can do it you can too. Buy a bucket of wall mud, some different size knifes, caulk and sandpaper. In a month you'll be a pro. Just jump in. When in doubt Youtube videos help.

"Here are a few things I have learned:Go with a good quality luxury vinyl plank or tile.  Easy to install, easy on the wallet, and damn near bullet proof.  Will not support mold or mildew. Looks great, too.Install a mini-split heat pump that is rated for your area.  Does not require ductwork, operates virtually silently, and sips electricity when compared to the old fashioned units.Install wiring for a security system.  Both for your peace of mind, and theirs. You can do this at the same time as the smoke alarms.Use solid wood cabinets, not particle board.  Barker Cabinets out of Tualatin makes a great product:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGgLaZ3DSVMIf you want to attract a high end renter, tile the shower and use a glass enclosure.  Makes it more sophisticated.  And this is the only room that really needs underfloor heat.  You can do an electric setup for around $400 or so.  Bonus points for a heated bath towel rack.  It is better to have a five or six foot shower than a tub in a DADU.For the kitchen a quartz counter top certainly costs more, but it is definitely better look and lower maintenance than many of the alternatives.  Worth it, IMHO.Make the master closet as big as you can, even if you have to swipe some square footage from an adjoining room.  And install an organizer system.  A white collar professional expects it, and their clothes deserve it.Tell your electrician that all switch boxes need a neutral wire, so that smart switches can be installed when desired.  And you want the larger, roomier boxes as well.  The better switches are bulkier (at least right now).Have them install a box in each room for a ceiling fan.  For a lot of the year, that may be all that is needed to keep the DADU comfortable.Install at least two recessed boxes for TVs.  One in the living room/eating area, and one in the bedroom:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QYNP7ldCf4They will need high speed Internet.  It will be better for them to have their own account, rather than piggyback off of yours. They will not argue about the cost. "

"Asbestos is a slow kill. That said, you still want to wear a mask rated for asbestos. A P100 mask is the highest level of particulate filtering. But a P95 would likely be sufficient too.

"I'd say that your best bet is to get into that crawlspace with rigid foam insulation boards. Friction-fit them between the joists and foam them in with Great Stuff if needed. That'll insulate as well as block drafts across the whole floor, not just that area. People also insulate with fiberglass and a vapor barrier. You can look up how people commonly insulate crawlspaces in your area.Barring that, put some red rosin paper down between the hardwood and the planks (good idea anyway). That'll block active drafts, but it won't insulate at all."
"If the marks are noticeable then it's likely eaten through the finish. In which case, yep, it's a sand, re-stain, re-finish. And for it to not be too noticeable?

So I ran a 25ft coax to the handy small closet around the corner where I placed the modem (and WiFi, Smart Home hubs, etc.) With a right-angle adapter at the jack, and a white cable on white baseboards, it looks quite reasonable.

"Just to back up what /u/Chris_Thrush said:  A contractor's job is to know how to do the job you hire them for.  It would be absurd to think every person who hires a contractor should know the ins and outs of doing the job they're hiring them for.  If you hired a contractor to clean your roof, and they hosed the inside of your house with water, doing damage to the walls inside, that is ABSOLUTELY on them.  Don't beat yourself up, it's unreasonable to expect you'd know everything about it!  That's why you hired someone who was supposed to know!"
Keep in mind u can get tile and bath tubs refinished to look as good as new as in many different colors. It's always less money to do this than gut/replace and lays for a good decade or more. I've seen some pretty miraculous things done with refinishing and wall system that would be thousands upon thousands if gut and new put in. It's typically about 450$ to redo a tub. Obviously if you have more than 2 layers of wall tile than gut it if you can't/don't want to refinish. Fwiw- two layers of tile is legit in construction world.  But not more. 
"Lumber quality is a matter of market conditions - busy markets mean understaffed warehouses/retailers and therefore less time is available for QA/QC, there is also the assumption that you are going to add overage into your lumber order so you can pick through and cull your own lumber. It's not just HD/Lowe's that are bad with bulk lumber orders, my 100+ year old local lumberyard has been sending out some shitty orders in the last year. Their response? Order 20% overage and call them to pick up the culled material. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;"
"What about the option of running a gas line into the addition so you can add a new gas burner in the addition?   For example, I replaced my electric wall convection heater with a [direct vent wall furnace](http://empirezoneheat.com/products/direct-vent-wall-furnaces/).   Efficient and effective.&gt;  I'd like the addition to become the main living space, so it must be comfortable year-round.

"&gt; I would propose that any fixture you purchase be able to fit the Philips Hue bulbs. You can set them to one color out of 16 million.I disagree. In addition to being overpriced, they are overkill. Hue bulbs may be capable of 16 million colors, but you would never want 15.8 million of those for a bathroom. If OP wants smart bulbs, something like these $15 [tunable white](https://www.amazon.com/SYLVANIA-Dimmable-equivalent-Daylight-Assistant/dp/B00R3ID2BG) bulbs will serve them better. Cheaper, not proprietary hub, and can still be set to any color you'd reasonably want. There are also no-hub-required wifi tunable bulbs, but I don't have experience with them. But really, OP should just buy basic 2700-3000k led bulbs and not worry about being able to customize the exact hue of light.

"Former pest control tech here. It could vary based on what chemical was used and what type of application (structural only vs. yard spray), but I would say youü__re totally fine. In my experience, extreme heat during July or August broke down our chemicals a lot faster than rain ever did. Once the chemical is dry after application (probably within an hour or less depending on application method) it will be fairly hard to wash it off just from an average rain. Most of the house is protected from the rain by the eaves, so a lot of the chemical wonü__t get touched by the rain anyway unless it is an ü__ITü__S RAINING SIDEWAYS!ü_ù type thing. Donü__t go power wash the house... that will definitely wash it away. But rain isnü__t much of an issue as long as it wasnü__t raining during the application."
"I had one for 4 years in my last house as the kitchen island countertop, so it got a lot of use. I have one in my house right now, but its a side countertop that most is used for storage. No food prep.It handled very well in my last house. I ended up re sanding it after about two years and it looked brand new again. I never kept up with oiling it which may have helped. In my current house I have not touched it since I installed it 3 years ago, its great as a side counter space. In both cases I cut the block with a circular saw. My kitchen also currently has 3 different counter materials and its not really a big deal. Island is one color, main kitchen cabinet counters is another, and the butcher block is off in this side space that is in the kitchen but not really part of the main kitchen. "

"I posted this about insurance quotes recently and over the summer it applied to roofing companies as well.All these companies are operating like a car dealership. They will initially hit you with a very high price hoping you bite on it. If you dont, they miraculously find additional discounts. One roofing company hit me with the price tag of $23,500. When I said that's not going to happen I was given discounts over the next 20 minutes. Some discounts were, 24 hour discount (commit in the next 24 hours), overstock on black shingles discount, put a company sign in my yard discount. In 20 minutes the price went from $23,500 to $15,800.The 2 sales reps at my house repeatedly called the 'owner' of the company the same way a car salesman always runs back to the sales manager. Advice: dont bite."
"It sort of sounds like my problem. My wife and I renovated our bathroom in the spring, and ever since the slightly sulfury, rotten eggy smell has been ever present. Some days not as bad as others. Certainly certain times of day are worse. The p trap was pointed at as the culprit. So was the basement dewatering sump pushing out the overflow through the same exit as the rest of the house's sewer line. I noticed some other houses on my street have their dewatering sump exiting out the side of the basement and empties in the yard or close to the street. I plan to do this some day soon and pray that will help. Cant stop thinking there will be another step to remediate the problem. My wife also has echoed the ""cant wait to move"" speech. Wonder if these gases have a deleterious effect on the brain?"
"Iü__m the paranoid type so Iü__m going to divert a little bit here from what the others are saying (their advice is solid, btw. Especially the renters insurance bit).  My thoughts are about safety and security.  Make sure your doors lock well.  If itü__s a rental space, other people could have keys.  Get a  locking mechanism that isnü__t dependent on a key like a door chain or door guard so you have a little extra security when youü__re at home alone. Sliding glass doors are notoriously easy to break into.  Think about getting a dowel or metal rod to place in the track to prevent the door from being opened should someone manage to overcome the lock.  Windows need locks too... there are cheaply little screw on things that can make it more difficult for bad guys to slide a window open.  "
"Thank you for both your feedback. For reference, [this is what I am using as a guide](https://imgur.com/a/OcLBK8w) (coming from [this source](https://www.how-to-wire-it.com/wiring-a-2-way-switch.html)). Looking at again, the main issue appears to be that the diagram has a three-wire (plus ground) coming from the fixture/power source to the first switch when mine has only a two-wire (plus ground) in that place.      &gt; What is with all the electrical tape wrapped around the wires near the switches? Specifically the left switch. I see an entire inch of bare copper exposed on (what is presumably) a hot connected to a screw.It is definitely a lot of tape. It was a result of cutting back too much plastic casing. I've now cut them shorter and connected them properly (if not functionally yet). "
"The best solution would be to winterize the house.  You contact a plumber and explain what you want.  The heating system is drained and filled with antifreeze.  All faucets, bath tub/shower valve, laundry etc... are drained.  All drain traps have antifreeze poured in them.  Water, gas can be shut off.  You can even shut off the electricity if you'd like.    Now you can leave the house over the winter.  The house will need to be  ""reopened"" in the spring.If you dont want to do this, then your next course of action is to leave the heat on at a low enough temperature to keep the house warm enough where freezing wont be an issue.  Of course you will be heating a vacant house.  I'd run in and check once a week or so on the house to make sure all systems are ok, nothing froze and flooded etc...  "
"I think your biggest issue from too much rain/over watering would be damage to the roots caused by oversaturation and a lack of oxygen. As other have stated just let it dry out.  What you may be seeing are the single fescue blades drowning out.I've always read that one fescue seed equals one plant/blade of grass and they are not self repairing.  When compared to KBG, kbg spreads via rhizomes and can repair thinning or bare areas by spreading underground roots into the thin spots; your fescue will not do that if those spots are dead.   Maybe try waiting it out, or lightly overseeing your thin spots with the same fescue seed to match the sod.  Or, if you would like to incorporate a mix, oversees with some KBG.Since you're in Atlanta, I'd have to imagine  the warm temps will help speed the drying.Not sure if you've ever tried Milorganite, but my TTTF and KBG blend love it.  Yes, it smells like a poo farm, but maybe the slow release and iron will have it looking great in a few weeks.I'm a customs broker and not a landscaper. Ymmv. Goodluck."
"I just installed a Tagaki tankless from SupplyHouse.  I absolutely love it.  Obviously you have to wait a few seconds for the hot water to kick in, but you get as much of it as you want.  I've had it for about 2 months at this point so it's still very fresh.It eliminated some of the recurring issues that I encountered like having to wait a bit between showers for hot water, and running a load of laundry/dishes at the same time as taking a shower.  We have 6 people living in our house so we certainly see our fair share of water usage.Previously with our 45 gallon tank it seemed we were always running out.  I did yearly maintenance on it, but it just wasn't up to the task.  One day it sprang a leak and I decided to treat myself.It wasn't about the long-term cost, it was about fixing a daily annoyance in our house.  I'm not entirely certain that even a 50 gallon tank would have solved our problems completely, but this tankless definitely does.  The overall cost was maybe 400 dollars more than a tank would have been anyway.NOTE: Check if there are energy rebates for getting a tanked heater vs a tankless.  For my gas company, the rebate for a tank heater was 50 dollars.  The rebate for a gas tankless heater was 300 dollars....  You can find this by contacting your local utilities company."

"There are just too many variables to make other than guess as to what the problem is. You may need to pony up for the cost of a service tech to go over the system and if landlord is not interested in paying to make it work better you would have to decide how much you want to invest into it. "
"&gt; Your attic is designed to breath or it causes major problems. They've found the roofing ventilation is of limited utility, at best it extends the life of asphalt shingles 5-10%.  You're better off sealing everything.https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/article/all-about-attic-venting"
"&gt; replace GFCI. The electrician may have pulled some piece of junk from his old junk box.That's what I'm leaning towards, they're like $100 though. *rabble rabble rabble*. It just seems so odd that it works fine with no load lines connected, but doesn't work with load lines but no load. "
"&gt;It's not too late to fix anything I may have done wrong.- puncturing the liner in the first place. That curb is Swiss cheese- eventually two layers of Hardibacker. How will you make them one?- using 1/4"" Hardibacker. 1/2"" goes on walls.- RedGard doesn't stick to Sika very well. "
"A shelving unit was knocked over and fell into the shower, damaging the liner.  Theyü__re not in direct line of the shower head, Iü__m more looking to keep water from seeping through as much as possible.  I donü__t mind re patching from time to time as necessary as itü__s only 2 small areas"
"Anyone considering installing a rain shower head should try one first. I've only encountered them a couple of times in hotels, and I hate them. They're an idea that seems good and looks fancy, but after using one once, you realize why putting the shower head on the wall makes much more sense."
"Block homes usually have wood framed roofs.Working at one right now in So Cal. Ceiling had a pretty bad infestation of drywood termites.Walls are not grouted, last big earthquake was nearly 100 years before it was built. Wondering how it'll hold up when a close earthquake finally happens."
Had a similar issue at my house. Ended up building a frame to extend the last diagonal to meet up with the stairs going down and made a mini post at the corner. Ours was a single diagonal not double but it could still work for you. I will try to take pictures later to give you a better idea. 
I bought a mitre saw recently and naively trusted the degree measurements were accurate. Went ahead and made all the cuts I needed for my project only to learn during assembly that my 45 degree cuts were not 45 degrees at all. I hope others learn from our pain. I now own a combination square.
"I kept a list and when I had enough small jobs I asked ü__myü_ù electrician (whoü__s done bigger jobs for us before) to come round and do them. Ended up being a full day of work. By the end of it I think he was cutting corners a bit to get it all done, so thatü__s something to watch out for. "
"I looked at tuffsheds. If thereü__s a tuffshed sales office near you they regularly have 15-20% off their in stock inventory.I decided to build my own 8x8 from plans. Wound up slightly cheaper than a tuffshed, but better construction: 2x4 vs 2x3 framing, hurricane straps, better roof, etc. "
"I think this is one of those things where you just have to dance the ethical line?  Instead of straight up lying and saying ""I didn't rewire that"" or telling the truth and saying ""I did rewire that"", you say ""Oh I don't have a log of every little thing I've done since I moved in 15 years ago"""
"I would hate to have that job, you basically have to be watching everyone in the instant they try to put something back you have to yell at them because they might be putting it back in the wrong spot, and once it is back in the wrong spot you aren't going to figure it out until it's too late"
I would take the numbers you get online with a grain of salt (a ballpark guess).  But it does seem you would need more than just a small ridge vent.  I donü__t really care for powered vents as they contribute to your electric billü__but you could go that route and have far less vents overall.

"I'm sorry, I wasn't specific enough, that's on me. The issue is that my 2 year old now likes to climb on the outside of the staircase, up the stairs, holding onto the spindles. My fear is that she makes it up 5-6 steps before I see her and she falls. She is super fast, and a little gymnast..."
"If the way things were done in the rest of the house by previous owner is anything to go by then this is probably the likely outcome. We've been employing a ""How bad could it possibly be?"" as a question to everything we come across and the answer seems to always be the worst case scenario. "
"If you do cover it, I would get a 4 inch end with threads and a threaded cap. Pipe glue the end on, thread the cap on. Now if you need to access it in the feature you just unscrew it. If it is a vent pipe, your landlord should be responsible for taking that pipe up and out through the roof."
"In some jurisdictions, they require you to connect a fresh air duct to the suction side of the circulating fan. Itü__s important that you connect it to the suction side, not the discharge side.  It fixes the problem youü__re experiencing, by causing the house to be under a positive pressure. "
"It does make business sense when a consumer can get the $600.00 faucet they saw at the specialty store for $300.00 at the Depot.As already mentioned, way more plastic in plumbing supplies.. And I know for fact that the Baldwin door hardware is made by kwickset... But it looks like Baldwin. "
"It might sound harsh but the reality is that Home Inspectors are not held responsible for missing things like possible leaks. You signed the deed and it is your house, warts and all. However some roofing companies offer free inspections and can do spot repairs if you donü__t need a new roof. "
Just a point of reference a garage door beam 4x12 16 ft span has to have a deflection of more than 3/4 of an inch or more to be in danger of failure and needs to be replaced. Your span is from joist to joist 16 maybe 24 inches with 2x4 shoring and no deflection. I hope that information helps.
"LOL! Sorry the 100 gallon sentence was directed at an earlier comment. I edited it too late. =)The tank would be about 8-10 feet away from the heater (line runs under steps and out the outer wall-it's on the second floor) so I was hoping the pressure wouldn't be a problem. Am I out of luck?"

"Most contractor supply places will sell patch mix(Something like t-1000). You can mix color into the patch and drag finish it in partially. Due that a couple of times with varying grey scale colors for a pretty cool multi color effect. Afterwards polish it down and itü__s ready for a sealer."
"My heat pump was doing the same thing.  It could hold it at a lower temperature but it would never achieve the desired temp.  Had a HVAC tech look at it and he found a coolant leak so the system was running on low coolant.  He fixed the leak and added some freon and the problem went away.  "
"No apologies. I second this 100%.I have the same philosophy with a lot of tools, camping equipment, outdoor recreation equipment. Buy cheap the first time around. If you never break it, good onya. If you use it enough to break it, that means you will reap the benefits of buying nicer stuff."

Side note: when we sold the house the buyer had a sewer line inspection done. The inspector put a camera in the pipe from the cleanout in the yard into the pipe that ran to the house. It was teeming with roaches. I was horrified. Itü__s no wonder the roaches can survive a nuclear apocalypse!

"I had almost submitted a comment to this effect to the u/Titus142 comment before noticing your reply:&gt;It's because the battery always runs out when everyone in the household has skooted off for 2 weeks to visit family for the holidays, so no-one is there to notice that the furnace hasn't come on for 10 days straight on the coldest weeks of the year.I've had that happen in my own house when I was away for an extended time.

I think I'd only be able to salvage maybe 25% of the original plaster, and at that point it's probably better to just gut it all.It's a shame plaster is such a pain to remove.

"Paint should be physically removed before trying a chemical stripper, IMO. You can try a [pull scraper](https://www.harborfreight.com/2-1-2-half-inch-paint-scraper-with-4-sided-blade-99827.html) to get the bulk off then move on to a drum sander.Paint will melt and gum up sandpaper pretty quickly. If you do sand with paint still on there, make sure to use the most aggressive grit available so it's more likely to cut the paint and not melt it. 24g on a drum sander can really mess your floors up quickly if you don't have good technique, though."
"Sure.  Pivoting walls and hidden passages have been around since the Egyptian Dynasties, maybe longer.

The chances of having to opening it back up is pretty damn small, IMHO.  Sheetrock and cement board is cheap, anyways.  I have no problem getting access to such things.  I chalk it up to just the cost of doing business.  Takes minutes to open, and an hour or so to fix the damage."

"You didn't look at the house yourself during the inspection??  I had never owned a home before and wanted to know *everything* about the place we were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on. Part of it was curiosity---I had never been in a crawlspace before and was oddly excited to see the ""underbelly"" of the house---but the other part was wanting the assurance that the house was a good one. I examined every nook and cranny of the house in parallel with our inspector (but not at the exact same time...I didn't want to be a distraction)."

"Get a decent skill saw....assuming your pickets are standard size you can prettymuch build the whole thing with a drill and skill saw.

"How many lights are affected? Just one? I assume you have tried replacing the light bulb and fixture as well? I had a similar problem that ended up being an outlet down the line that was feeding the circuit. The contractor used the 'backstab' option on the outlet and eventually it failed. Basically the random on and off was caused by arcing in the box. Here was my plan of attack. 1. First, figure out EVERY outlet and switch in the house. Make a map of them. Then mark off what is and is not working. You can update it if something stops working after a while. 2. Map the circuits. You should be able to figure out whether all the not working components are on a single circuit. And they should be. Now you know where they are. 3. Shut off that circuit. Inspect every single switch and receptacle. Hell, I'd just replace them. New ones are not expensive, and then you can check all the wiring on each. Make sure nothing has gotten loose. That's almost certainly the problem. Somewhere, in one of those boxes on that circuit, something is loose.  "
"To expand on why RahchachaNY and duck_giblets have said shower replacement and that what you're suggesting doesn't make it waterproof..There is a whole waterproofing system that's meant to go behind the tiles (look up the Schluter Kerdi system or Mapei/Ardex roll on membranes). Tiles and grout effectively are decorative and *will always have some level of water transfer, even if you just sealed them*, your shower should be usable without them without any leakage. If this waterproofing system behind them fails, you now have a leaky shower. The only way to fix this is a complete gut and re-do. Even with those wild temperature swings, a waterproofing system should survive through that quite comfortably if installed according to current spec.If the plumbing isn't leaking, then the likely culprit is the shower. Before you go into a full gut, it'd definitely be worth getting some investigative work done to confirm this, because shits gonna be expensive, OP.Re-doing existing caulk with silicone, re-doing grout and sealing it will fail given time."
"I hear a lot of people say that, but it never made sense to me. We have hundreds of thousands of examples of old construction.  The craftmanship is better, often the engineering is better, and the materials are better (old growth vs mass produced quick growth; lime based mortars that flexed better; etc).  I would actually argue that most old homes are still standing.  Why do we see less of them?  Well it's because the population in the 18th and 19th century was much lower than today and now those homes represent a minority.  If you live in a town center, almost every home you see is at least 100 years old.  If there were dozens of new constructions mixed into those neighborhoods, then it would lend support to the survivorship theory, but that's largely not the case.  Most of those old neighborhoods are very homogeneous.  The neighborhoods where I do see lots of new construction mixed in are neighborhoods that were built in the 1940s onward (usually 70s).The houses that didn't last nearly all have one thing in common: vacancy.  Pipes burst in winter, wood swells in summer, roofs don't get repaired.  I've seen old houses in great condition that have been standing for over a hundred years completely fall apart in 5 because no one is living there.  Same thing would happen with any house.    "
"It is really hard to tell from your photo, but it looks like each of the upper cabinets could be separate, which would be great.  Go on top and see if there is one piece of plywood connecting everything together or if it looks like the top of your kitchen cabinets.If they are separate, it makes it easier.  I'd first remove the shelves and the crown moulding, but save it cause you will need to re-use it.  In the middle it looks like to pieces of wood butted up against each other.  See if you can pry up a little bit and slide something like a recipe card under it, just to make sure it doesn't go in to the base board.  Look for any fasteners that may tell you how it is all connected.  If it has been painted many times, you may need to score the seam with a utility knife.  If you are lucky you could pry it all apart without cutting (except the crown molding).Putting it back together.  For the crown molding, put you could cut the removed pieces to go back into the wall, so it will wrap around.  Where the 3 vertical boards were removed, you will need to sand around the cut, maybe put some wood putty down to smooth it, then paint over it.  It would probably look cleanest to either remove the back panel and continue the crown molding (you would need more) or remove it and patch and paint the drywall."
"Ok, my experience is a multi step approach that is way cheaper than any machine. But first is incense, it works, I highly recommend nag champa the stuff in the blue box w/ silver writing and the taped ends. And then burn lots of them, upstairs, down stairs in basements. And then scented candles also, burn them all the time, for a few days, multiple of those. Dont do incense and candles at the same time, that's too much.If there are any carpeted areas dust w/ baking soda and let set for a few minutes and vacuum up.And the big kicker are animal smells, Natures Miracle, it is an enzyme based cleaner and you can work it in to carpet, wood, ceramics, furniture without damage most of the time. And it will eat biological based messes that cause odors.And then if you have the ability or desire leave some citrus peels laying around for a few hours after eating one.And then a great winter method when it starts to get dry inside is to get some whole spices like cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, star anise, etc. But you can put some water and the spices into a cheap pot or kettle and set to the lowest simmer on a stove, woodstove, or in a candle potpourri warmer. You can even add a few drops of an essential oil.And then the #1 biggest help is air movement. The solution to smelly pollution is dilution."
"Have you ever installed cabinets?Even with perfectly level floors and flat walls it is not for beginners unless you are willing to learn it as you go and are ok with making a healthy amount of mistakes. If your floors are not level and your walls are not flat (they never are), it is  like like to run a marathon within an obstacle coarse. Also, laying out cabinets take some experience too, but again not impossible. If you have the time and are willing to learn go for it. If not get with Loweü__s or Home Depot for laying it all out and buy from them. They have specials on the materials all the time.I got Loweü__s Caspian line recently at 25% off plus a 10% off on top of that.  This particular line was plywood which is preferred over the MDF stuff. I have pics of before and after if interested. I loved them and a woman recently commented she ü__could picture herself making babies in that kitchen.ü_ùDo not get them installed by HD or Loweü__s. Use Home Advisor  to get up to 3 installer to quote it for you once you have the layout.  I do not know anything about IKEA cabinets other than folks say they are middle of the road on price and performance. I did use their free online kitchen planning software to design my kitchen, but in the end my installer corrected, on the fly, a lot of rookie mistakes I made in the layout. He even built me a custom double over cabinet which matched PERFECTLY for $995. That may not sound like a deal but for a custom piece to match perfectly with existing cabs, it is a steal and well worth the money to me.  "
"This was posted here about a half a year or so ago.  It is from Gila Window Films:**Q: Can I apply film to dual pane / dual pane low-e windows?***A: Be sure to read instructions before applying a given film to dual pane windows. Dual pane windows are windows composed of two panes of glass separated by an air space and a perimeter spacing bar that also seals the edges against moisture intrusion into the air space. Film installation can be done on the room-side surface of dual pane windows provided the proper films are selected.* *Certain films can cause the inner pane to get too hot and possibly damage the weather seals or even break the glass. Some dual pane windows, such as used in some motor homes, are made of tempered glass. Usually the outer pane of tempered dual pane windows is also tinted. Tempered glass cannot be broken from solar heat absorption, no matter what film is installed on them. However, care still must be taken to select the proper film because of the potential for premature seal failure because an excessively absorptive film is used which could cases over heating of the seals and excessive stress through expansion cycling.* *It may be necessary to contact a member of the Eastman technical support team to obtain clarification on the best films for such windows. Dual pane Low-E and Dual pane tinted windows can safely have glare control films applied to the outside surface. Low-E coatings are applied to one of the inside surfaces of the glazing system, so its performance (in reducing wintertime heat loss) is not affected.*"
"Having recently gone through the process for the first time, I hear ya.  You don't know what you don't know and it's a lot to digest.  /r/personalfinace can help with the money/budget side and there is /r/realestate that you can peruse (they will illustrate some stories, but I found them to be of limited help for a first timer).  Go ahead and start looking over listings on [realtor.com](https://realtor.com) and it will give you a sense for what's available in your area.  Once you get serious, your realtor can take some time to walk you though a lot of the requirements.&amp;#x200B;Since you are in planning stages I'll tell you that you will be best served to put together the largest downpayment you can manage.  Ideal is  20% down, but that's pretty tough to do in some markets so anywhere from 5-15% is more common (at least in my area).  As you shop mortgages factor in PMI fees, insurance, and property taxes.  That will get you closer to the ""real"" cost of ownership.  On top of that, you'll want a cash reserve for when your furnace blows or water heater shits the bed in the middle of winter.  After your cash reserve then you need to have an idea of the costs of upgrades.  If you are not on a timeline, then you can save and do this at your own pace.  If you plan on turning the house around in 2 years you better have substantial cash in the bank now.   Lastly, first time owners always get surprised by the cash outlay of getting your home set up and furnished.  Right after shelling out a big check for inspections and downpayment you are going to be looking at paint, furniture, window treatements, appliances, and a hundred other little bits you didn't know you needed (not all the things in my list will apply to you, but I promise you'll end up needing a few grand in cash at move in for all number of unexpected expenses).&amp;#x200B;All that to say, I love owning a house. But holy shit it is not always a rosy picture that people paint.  In my experience maintaining a cash cushion alleviates SO MUCH stress associated with the unkowns. &amp;#x200B;"

This is the right answer. Like the valve assembly is fine. The cartridge is designed to be easily replaceable as they get gunked up from hard water. OP should look on YouTube for step by step instructions and go from there. Reassemble with a new trim kit and it will look like a brand new unit.

Your picture doesn't match your description but all a switch needs to do is act at a breaker open/close to one wire and have a separate bare or green ground. So black is usually hot and it runs through the switch. The switch completes the connection same as touching two broken wires together.

"IDK- it may depend on the area. In the northeast almost all the homes of that age had radiators.

"My house was made in 85, so I was past that point. When the inspection was done on my house, they checked for asbestos and lead paint, and determined that I was all clear. Was that done for your house? You can get someone to come and take a look, and let you know what would be problematic with either of those. Would highly recommend that before any major project.I'll be doing that with another project of mine, have a structural engineer come out and let me know if my changes will cause my house to collapse or not. Just a good idea in general."
"My understanding is there are wall-warts they can plug into and the 24VAC doesn't have to come from the furnace.  My thermostat wires follow a really obscure path so I'm thinking of putting an outlet in the attic directly above my upstairs thermostat and another in the basement directly below my downstairs thermostat.  That way I only have to run it right into the stud cavity, which I can reach from directly above or below.This will also let me easily put an outlet in those walls, which would be nice because I have no power in either hallway."
"Nope.  Don't be disappointed, though.  There are too many variables.  You need to know if the foundation and walls can support it, or if additional structure is needed.  When you add add square footage, the HVAC must also be evaluated.  You need two points of egress in case of fire.  Lighting is also a consideration, in addition to the outlets.Interview at least three architects or general contractors.  They'll tell you if it is feasible, and might be able to ballpark an estimated price.  Seeing as you live in NorCal, it's not gonna be cheap."
"Re-grout with epoxy grout is the best long term solution. It's basically non-porous (less than 0.05% water transfer on Mapei products in lab testing iirc), doesn't stain, and bacterial growth is basically at the minimal you'd ever get for this type of enclosure.Alternatively, use a high quality sealer on the grout (may need re-application every year or so depending) and *use cleaning products according to what the technical sheet says* - if it says no bleach, then no bleach. If it says no citrus based cleaners, then no citrus based cleaners. "
"Thank you everyone. I reached out to the oil company. The previous owners used less oil in the 2,500sf house than I did in my old place. Which was 750sf. Sounds like the stove definitly helps out. I panic bought three tons of pellets. I just got what they used to use and then a ton of some premiums. If I don't like those ones, I will give them to friends who burn pellets as well. Looking forward to using this thing.

The grit might grab the mold."
"Yup....I had a wasp nest move in right by my front door. Didn't realize it until my dog disturbed it and I got stung 17 times. Wound up in the ER because of a history of allergies. The kicker. My insurance didn't cover it because they claimed it wasn't an emergency since I DIDN'T go into anaphylactic shock. I guess I was supposed to wait until after I passed out to dial 911 instead of running to the ER BEFORE I almost died.  Anyway, ever since then, I have a can of hornet/wasp spray. Haven't used it since that time, but I'm glad it's there. "
"Gotcha. I also asked if there's a return in that room, but I'm thinking it doesn't really matter if nothing changes when the door is open. If a particular room has a register, but not a return, then you won't get good flow unless air can also make its way back to the unit. So, rooms with no returns have to either keep their doors open, or at least have enough clearance under them for air to escape. Sounds like that's not the issue, though.I'm afraid I can't be much help. Except to say I don't think distance is the only factor. Our unit is in the basement, but the basement register only a few feet away is by far the weakest. And I think it's because it's the only one supplied by a flexible duct hose with sharp turns. Whereas the others are all smooth large ducts with less resistance. Good luck."
"It's less a matter of seeing whether the walls are straight/plumb in a picture and more knowing that it is just a fact.As I mentioned, I would have shared the differences between the two sides to make it less noticable, but it seems all the cut tiles are on the drain side. It's a lazy way to do things, but still considered proper. I also think it looks more obvious because one tile above and to the left, sticks out a bit more than the others. It's also where the drain is located.I would be more concerned with what's under the tile. Hopefully, the GC put in a proper shower pan and waterproofed the walls. In addition, there should be caulk around in any areas with a change of plane (wall to floor). So, all in all, it would bother me, but I couldn't say that it's improper tiling, just lazy."
"Technically, plaster/lath (wood) provide minimal insulation.  What plaster does provide is, if it is intact, is less air infiltration to the room.  In most old homes, the final coat of plaster was installed to the trim around windows and doors sealing them.  An uninsulated wall cavity that has no air movement (meaning not balloon construction) may be about R5.  The plaster and lath may add another R0.5.For reference, most homes in my area are insulated to R25 in the walls.Where the benefit is seen is when you compare uninsulated plaster/lath to uninsulated Sheetrock.  As noted, plaster is heavy and has more mass.  That mass retains the interior cooling/heat better than the lighter and thinner Sheetrock, adding to how the room ü__feelsü__ as the temperature is released back to the room.  "
"When (and where) I renovated, the permitting/inspection was simple and not at all intimidating. First I pulled electrical and plumbing permits as a homeowner. When the work was almost done (before the drywall goes back up)  the inspectors wanted a cursory look. Probably 10 minutes each. They also offered some helpful advice.They wanted a licensed electrician to sign off on the work. Hired one, who validated the work and did some of the more confusing work. Didn't need a licensed plumber.A few months later, they dropped by again. The plumbing inspector's only issue was my bathroom faucet wasn't labeled Hot/Cold (I applied a sticker), and the electrical inspector checked a few outlets, looked in the panel, and signed off, too.I was really stressed for no reason at all. You don't need to be. "
"When i bought my place I had to have it surveyed. They put steaks in each corner right on top of metal rods that were already driven in the ground. Of course one of my neighbors came out and said those things arent accurate, that's a foot off. I said ok cool lady thanks and that was that. Doesnt really matter what they think. The surveyors are going off of measurements. Not family members neighbors hearsay. If she wants to spend a couple hundred dollars she can hire her own surveyors to prove her wrong.edit to add. You could also call up the survey company and tell them you're unsure of their markings and would like them to double-check. They take that stuff pretty serious. Thats why it cost so much for a dude to measure out your property. im sure they will do what they can to prove it correct. "
"I would recommend you get rid of the vanity. Repainting cabinetry only gives you a few more years, and that cabinetry appears to be the old-style ""low"" bathroom cabinets instead of the counter-height that are common now. If this were my bathroom, I'd take down the walls between toilet, shower and tub. Move the shower plumbing to the back wall and rebuild those two walls as shorer knee walls that come up to chest height. Enclose it in glass with a glass door. It'll feel much more spacious and in that new knee wall you can probably build the shower bench you want. Maybe put in a niche in the wall for shampoo and such, too. I prefer a tiled niche to anything that sticks out into the shower taking up space. Another option is to leave the plumbing where it is and only convert one wall to half glass. I'd replace the vanity with basic new cabinets and countertop. I'd leave the tub as-is, but replace all its fixtures along with anything else that's gold/brass. What I'd do with the window depends on what's outside of it. I'd try not to mess with it."
"This sub is mostly full of Americans, and houses are built very differently than in Europe.How is your house framed? Wood? Stone? I can't tell from your photo.You said you removed the stucco, so I assume you don't have drywall. Is it possible it's just the lath that's deteriorated? Structural boards are usually laid the other way (short side facing down, tall sides sideways). 1x4"" boards aren't (usually...) structural. It looks like you might also have brick above, which may be fine, though that could be rotted wood. The actual framing for the roof doesn't look too bad, though it's hard to tell. The rear framing member like it's in the worst shape, but the closer one looks okay.You should hire a structural engineer like people have said. I don't think your house will need to be demolished, and you may not need to remove the entire roof and deck. It may be a new roof plus some plaster or drywall, or it may be more involved. No one here can tell, unfortunately, and what us Americans think may not even be right for European building standards."

I grew up in 4H and have many friends who sew either full time or as a hobby. I once posted ü__like this if you used the sewing shears to cut paper when you were a kidü_ù on Facebook and got so many angry reacts I was afraid Amnesty International was going to bust in and try me for war crimes. 
I had the same dilemma. All my research pointed towards macerating toilets being terrible. BIL and I trenched it ourselves and put in a sewage ejector. Totally worth it. hardest part was getting rid of the old concrete. Oh and hitting the water table while digging for the ejector. That was fun.

"I replaced them all out of personal preference, so that if one trips I can reset it right there at the outlet and not have to hunt down which upstream outlet to reset. You could also just put in GFCI breakers... but again it would be a pain to go to the breaker to reset it every time one trips."
"I've never calibrated a gas oven. With electric the temps vary during operation about 50 F above and below the set temp. It is not impossible? that temps vary a lot with a flame source. i.e. the flame is not adjusted by the thermostat, only the timing of the flame. The link explains it, I think"

"Mineral spirits does it, but you have to scrape off the dried silicone and then scrub the heck out of what's left on the tile with a greenie pad and mineral spirits. At least, that's how we did it. Our mineral spirits are old and have congealed though... maybe that's part of the issue.Thanks!"
One alternative they've done in the past is run the feed in 12/2 to the light fixture in the ceiling and 12/2 to the switch and utilize the white and black wires to switch the light. This leaves you without a neutral in the switch box. You would have to use 12/3 to do this and keep the neutral.
"Perfect, just make sure to tell them that you want the door to be properly installed without any scratches, and that you don't like the scratches on the one that has been installed, so they put under consideration replacing the door instead of fixing it. Unless you are okay with fixing it as is"
"Pull all the jumpers off your current motherboard and then boot it up, shut it down, replace the jumpers one by one and see if that wipes whatever bootstrapped security they have on the motherboard first.  It works so often with motherboards that it's worth a try before you spend some money."
Same thing happens to me. The driver that comes with a box of Spax is usually stripped before the box is empty. I bought some Bosch drivers and they seem to be holding up better but I just plan on them being disposable. To me chewing throgh a few drivers a year is still better than predrilling 
"Seriously, my parents have a central vacuum in the house they just built and itü__s the best thing ever.  They even had some floor level ports put in the rooms with hardwood so my mom doesnü__t have to mess with a dustpan.  She just sweeps the dirt in front of the little slot and it disappears!"
"Sometimes there's a switch inside labelled ""energy saver"". If you turn that on, it should decrease or eliminate the heat in that area. It's heated to prevent condensation from building up.There might also be a sensor that regulates the temperature which has gone bad, if the heat is excessive."
Sounds like a bearing or maybe just something stuck in the drum.  Start popping covers off and try to isolate the sound.  That looks like a fairly old dryer though so it may just be time for a replacement.  You may end up spending many hours and dollars to fix something that isn't worth fixing.
Talk to your realtor and/or the selling agent and see if they're OK with having the pool inspected.  You should be able to have a local pool maintenance/installer guy come out and give it a look.  They'll be able to spot things you probably can't in terms of the liner condition and other stuff.

"The proximity sensors detect if people are home/away. This feature can help save money.Another nice thing about the ecobee are the remote sensors so the heat or cooling will run more or less based on the desired temp setting for that area. This doesnü__t save money but it can improve comfort."
"The scenario I was referencing is for a single zone system. True it cannot direct cool air or warm air based on the sensor but the remote sensor does allow you to let the system run until the desired temp is reached at the remote sensor, instead of reaching the set point temp at the thermostat."

Yeah atleast what the contractor says is its good stuff and the reviews all seem to think the same..who knows. I've read that some people say not to seal it right away and others say its good. I am about 2-3 months from snow fall. Do you think its a good idea to seal it or wait until next year?

"You're welcome. The boards may split where the screws are. You want the load to be supported from underneath, which will be provided by adding the strip I mentioned. After you have the strip added, you also want to screw each slat down to it, which will provide bracing to keep the frame square."

"If you live in a snowy climate both  u/stromm and u/CheeseWeasler have the correct answer if you life in a snowy climate. The step down allows you to correctly flash the door, and keeps the snow on the siding / foundation, not at the seam between the door and the house.Yes it has flashing, but its not water proof. If snow sits there it will seep into the house and potentially cause rot. My deck has one step down and I hardly even notice, however I do notice all the rotten sills at my friends houses who have the deck right level with the door. "
"It sounds like you're thinking the reset button ""reboots"" the water heater. In reality they are much much simpler than that. The only thing the reset button is there for is to act as a circuit breaker if there's a problem in the internal wiring of the water heater or elements.What could be happening is that your thermostat is not working properly and the act of changing it caused it to (re) make it's contact and start working again. I'd contact the water heater company for warranty work before getting too far down the path of DIY'ing a repair."
"Normally, there are transition pieces under the door, it looks like you do not have them. I'm talking about the simple t mouldings that go directly under the actual door. Plus, when I install my flooring, I always cut the bottom of the door moulding to hide the flooring underneath.For yours, I would pull it up and replace it with more detailed cuts. From my experience as a home owner, things might stick out to you really bad, like a slightly off colored floor piece, but nobody else in the world will notice it without you pointing it out first."
"Possible you have a misconception about condensation.  A moisture barrier alone won't stop condensation, because it's not caused by moisture going through anything.  It's not moisture coming up from the slab.It's moisture from the hot, humid air in your house coming out of the air when it hits your cold slab. Vapor/moisture barrier as much as you want, the moisture is already in the room.  When the air hits a cold surface it can't hold the moisture anymore, so it condenses into water.You need thermal insulation as well as a moisture barrier."
"UPDATE:My friend came to check it out. I asked if the igniter was the problem. He said 99.99% of the time the igniter isn't the problem, and he was right! There is a flu that leads out of the roof for exhaust, apparently because it hadn't been ran in some time, a fair amount of dust and debris found its way down the flu and clogged the airway. There was a small tube that lead to the pressure switch. The tube couldn't draw air, which had a fail safe to not let the igniters do their work. He cleaned the flu, and the igniters kicked on perfectly!"
"While getting individual pieces replaced is the easiest, it's going to be difficult to actually do unless they were produced by a local company that is willing to do that kind of work.  Plus, in the end, you are going to end up paying custom build prices to have the inserts made.Unless you have some reason that disturbing the casing of the window would be very problematic, just order new replacement windows.  The biggest issue to watch for with that is to make sure the installers actually insulate around the window and don't just caulk and go."
"Window ""replacement"" is not much of an efficiency gain. Repairing windows so they are functional is a good plan.Efficiency/comfort gains are most easily accomplished [heating climate] by1] air sealing and insulating attics2]air sealing and insulating your rim boardsMost of us have lived with horrible 60's remodels and spent our money on items that pay for themselves in reasonable time frames.If your basement is wet the first fix is grading your yard away from your house but gutters [and thoughtful downspout placement] is a close second"
"You own the rent house, or you're renting it?If you're renting, call your landlord. It's not your problem. If you're the landlord, I'd call an exterminator.

"You want it to soak into the thirsty wood.  Really doesn't matter how it ends up on the wood.  Your deck will tell you when it has had enough stain.Experiment on how much to apply on each pass.  Your goal is to NOT wipe much of it off, because that is just wasted material. You want to watch it soak in, yet not seeing any puddles lying on the surface for a long time. Best to do two or three thin coats, rather than one super thick coat. And look for stain with built-in UV protection.  Much better for both for the stain and the wood underneath."
"You want to skim that water off, not drain it out.  if you drain the boiler, the scum will stick to the sides, and when you fill it again, it'll still be there.  There should be a drain up high (probably above the normal water level), for that purpose.  Also, whenever you add water to boiler, you need to boil it.  tap water contains a lot of disolved oxygen, and will be corrosive. boiling it drives the oxygen out.  Find a compotent steam professional (not just a plumber, or an hvac company, a *STEAM* person) to teach you what you need to do.

"In my city those are old school. In the last 30 years they've replaced the meter by the street to be in/at the house. We have a water curb box which is a underground box that turns off the water to your house with a key bar, which only the city has. My city is responsible for the main line and curb box, I'm responsible for the entire line from the curb box to my house which is 4 feet down under the freeze line and was completely rusted metal the entire length. It's not diy friendly in my area, and yes I think I paid just under 4K to have the entire original line replaced going to my 1947 home 3 summers ago.

"Something I've not yet seen in the comments is to contact your local utility provider. A lot of states mandate that the utility companies provide energy efficiency discounts for services.  In Massachusetts for instance I was able to get a free energy audit which resulted in free LED lights for all the rooms (value $500), free air gap sealing throughout entire home (valued $2300) and a 20% discount for blown in insulation in the attic ($300).Point is, try to contact your electrical/gas company and see if they have energy efficiency incentives. One phone call could save you towards of dollars in upgraded, plus the added bonus of less oil/gas usage over the years.  If the company can't help you check with the state to see if they offer these programs. A couple phone calls could save you thousands."
"That cheap faux wood paneling on your current walls would look excellent paintedü__and in a basement, even better-looking than drywall, in my opinion. Basements are supposed to be kinda groovy.What kind of room are you looking to create there? If a bedroom, know that it might not be up to code: Youü__d need an egress-sized window. In any case, just frame it out and Sheetrock the new walls, insulating first if you like. Never mind that the new walls wonü__t be paneled like your current ones: Nobodyü__s gonna care; itü__s a basement.I donü__t see a problem with the ceiling. You could leave the structure up there and simply replace the tiles.

"You absolutely need to repair or replace any wire nicks if they are down to the copper. Your options are 1) run a new wire for that section (might be tricky depending on how far it is and what the access is like), 2) add a junction box at this location (not ideal), 3) get a wire splice kit that is rated for concealed in-wall use (may or may not be availle depending on what kind of wiring this is... I canü__t really tell). Just to be clear, wrapping that mess with electrical tape is NOT an appropriate solution.As for nail plates: in theory nail plates are required anytime a wire is less than 1.25ü_ù from the face of a stud. In practice they are not used much unless the wire position is egregious. This doesnü__t seem to be that bad. You need to be more careful about cutting into the wall blindly."
"having a vapor barrier is key to whether or not ""moisture"" is trapped in the insulation some where.  Years ago (nearly 20) I blew in cellulose insulation where I had intact exterior walls by hole sawing a 1 1/2"" dia hole and rigging up a blower to blower the insulation into the stud gravity. I cut the hole just below the bottom edge of the wall's top plates and was easy for my to patch.  At that time, there was a paint/primer available that had a ""built-in"" vapor barrier property.  So I painted these walls with that. Elsewhere where I removed plaster/lath I went in with fiberglass batts and used the plastic sheeting for the vapor barrier.  Made a huge difference on the heating and cooling as well as the draftiness of the house. Took us about 5 years to complete as we renovated one room at a time."
"Financial remedy? As in the contractor will give you a discount on the renovation because your walls are a couple degrees out of square? Unless you really fight him for it that is going to be really unlikely.Like I said before, he would only have legal requirements on the tolerances if they were stated in the project specifications i.e. the contract. You mention that you're trying to find ""official"" tolerances for what is acceptable online, but you won't find them anywhere because there aren't any. Construction is an inexact science and different people have different opinions as to what is acceptable.Your best bet is to point out the most noticeable spots and ask him what he plans to do to fix them. There are probably tricks that can be done to the floor and to the walls to make what you're seeing go away. If he says you are being too picky and it's fine as is then without a contract spelling out the tolerances there isn't much you can do. Even if you went to court you would probably lose this one.Whatever you do, point out the issues to the contractor immediately. He will be much more willing to do something about them that way. Do not wait until he finishes the job, asks for the final payment, then try to withhold it until he re-frames the house. That is not going to work out well for you."
"No no no - we were in a very similar situation and those pods/boxes have their place but are stupidly expensive for their size.  Get a quote for renting a moving truck for more days, lock it up and let it sit on the curb outside your house for a few nights if you have to while you load it up. The mileage and fuel is where most of the cost is, having a truck for a local move a of little mileage for a day or three is about as good as it gets (mid week may be cheaper as it's unlikely anyone else would be wanting it anyway).  Things you didn't think of:  Contact your home insurance company.  They'll cover everything you own in the truck...unless your policy terminates days before the policy at the new address is in force.  In our case our agent simply had to adjust the policy dates for virtually no noticeable cost difference to insure the policies overlapped a day.  It's a bit of nit picking, but absolutely call them anyway and make sure your auto policy covers the rental/size truck you'll be driving as well.  EDIT:  use anyone but uhaul, it's nightmares all the way down.  Note that even if you reserve a truck the contract doesn't guarantee you a truck...they could tell you that they have one for you but it's 60 miles away.  Budget has been great for me and I've heard good things about Penske.  "

"&gt; Now you're making me question it. You're probably right. The water for the house is all 1/2"", which seems so stupid to me...in the house in 3/4"", then right down to 1/2"" before anything even has a chance to branch off. Not sure I understand all of that... But... typically you'll see 1/2"" for water and 3/4"" for hydronic heat. Sometimes you'll even see 1"" for heat, just depends on how it flows and branches, etc. Something a lot of people do when they repipe (or build a home) is bring 3/4"" copper all the way out to sinks, showers, etc. Makes a huge difference --it's awesome. &gt; Oh I do for sure! I'm not just trying to be comfortable while working, I want to optimize the system as a whole. Is there any way to better insulate the furnace itself, if insulating the pipes doesn't make much of a difference? No.... Well, you should have insulation between the covers and the boiler but you don't really want to wrap it with insulation or anything. The burner needs an air supply and you don't want to mess up anything. It'll still be a little warm but shouldn't be crazy hot. Once the pipes are insulated it should cool down the room/space a lot. There is a supply and a return side of your boiler. You can insulate both sides. At some point if you start really messing with the system you'll want to know if you have a condensing or non-condensing boiler, and you'll want to know what your delta-t is (change in temp between supply and return). For starters, figure out what size pipes you have and put the foam noodle insulation on the pipes. We have a combination of 3/4"" and 1"" pipe. I doubled up the black foam strips around the pipes (at the boiler) to keep in more heat. My garage is insulated but not heated. I noticed a big difference (garage was cold in winter) when I insulated the copper pipes. "

As a retired carpenter in my opinion those 2 2x10's are not adequate for a single level much less a bi-level.It should have been at least 3 for a single and it depends a lot on how the ends are supported.There is a lot of weight on that beam and you've been lucky so far that it hasn't collapsed.

I second the big boxes idea. I recently bought new construction and replaced a bunch of switches with timers and some WeMoü__s. And I replaced some outlets with USB. Thankfully the guys who wired the place didnü__t cheap out on boxes. They were deep enough that I had no trouble fitting anything.

"Nature abhors a vacuum. Whatever you do, weeds will grow. Your best bet, long term, is to pick the plant yourself. All the chemicals will work, but there's environmental consequences, not all of which we know. Ex: it's looking like a main ingredient in roundup may be causing havoc in honey bees."

"Normally you would air seal and insulate the attic floor, but would allow the underside of the roof to be the same temperature as outdoors.    A ridge vent would allow any heat that escaped to exit at the peak of the roof, and soffit vents would allow the winter air to be drawn in to replace it."
"Oh wow, yours turned out well. You had way more patience than I did if you went through with the DIY. After seeing all the work they did for our cabinet frames alone I'm glad we ended up paying someone. Side note, your granite looks like the granite we have in one of our bathrooms. I like it. "

"We didnü__t buy Sears brand products. We have warranties through the original manufacturer. Sears has Bosch dishwashers and lots of other well known brands of washer/dryers, stoves, fridge, etc. Edit - they price matched on Bosch. It was on sale cheaper at another store so they price matched. "
"We had a contractor replace two existing columns in our 98 year old house.  They weren't installed with footers and one was actually put in upside down...  They jacked up the house, cut into the basement floor and poured footings then installed new steel.  Total $1950, large city in the midwest."

"Another issue I just thought of that I'm not sure if it's done ""the right way"" but based on all the comments here I'm very skeptical. The shower wall of the shower niche is basically against another sheetrock on the opposite wall on the other side. I suspect there's a layer of tar paper between the shower niche cement board and the sheetrock. I'm thinking if I accidentally screw something into the wall of the opposite side, then this would potentially cause water leakage. Should the back of the shower niche be against sheetrock of another wall?"
"I built my own and it cost a hair less than a kit. I would still build my own though. I helped two friends assemble their kits, one almost identical to mine. His only had 2 framed walls, the other two were just shearing and a board down the seam. Many of his boards were knotted and warped quickly out of the package. I also customised mine  a little more by extending the roof an extra 6 ft  eyond the wall for a bbq pad. I would DIY  build mine again, little less cost, more stout (4 framed walls instead of two), hand picked quality boards, etc..."
"If you're looking for a second opinion, I would reach out to a competing  structural engineering firm. Reddit certainly can't answer this type of question accurately. There's a reason for that 4-6 years of college :pSo if you don't like what the first engineer is telling you, call up a competitor and see what their opinion is. It's highly likely they will suggest the same remedies, since they will be considering the same data, but it's always good to compare pricing, especially with foundation repairs, as they can end up being rather expensive."
"Is the intention to leave the space unfinished?If so, I would get a 2x6 or 2x8 that spans a number of trusses (3 or 4) - and install it vertically, above the bottom chord of the trusses.  Use properly installed lag bolts to install rings to the 2x6 (2x8). If you intend to have side to side movement on the gymnastic rings, you might want to lag bolt this beam to the trusses - or use a good number of decently sized screws.This will spread any point load out over a couple of trusses, and allow you to have a proper point to fasten your rings too."

The flow felt like it doubled to every outlet in the house and we are still yet to replace a lot of the internal 15mm.It was a lot of work we did it ourselves but it was totally worth it. It improved the hot output from our combi boiler as running the cold simultaneously no longer restricted the flow to the boiler "
"When My street was replaced, the contractors offered a deal to do my driveway in concrete. They offered $5000 to do a single lane driveway for about 20 feet. Compare that to an estimate I received prior was for $3500 This included The driveway, an angled off side parking spot, AND a 10x20 patio. PLUS, new sidewalk section and a rear step for the back door.More than saving money, The concrete the city payed for is pretty crappy and breaking up in a few places at the curb and sidewalk they replaced.Take your time and find a decent contractor."

"Depends where you are and how cold it gets and most importantly, where is/are your thermostat sensor(s) located.  Take my house - thermostat is in the heart of the house, but my master bathroom is in an addition at the back of the house 50 feet away and one story up with an enclosed staircase in between.  If I set my thermostat, smart dumb or otherwise, incorrectly in the dead of winter I would not be the least bit surprised if I froze my pipes.  No one else should either.  Just because they call it ü__smartü_ù doesnü__t mean you can shut your brain off people!  Smart really just means itü__s not binary anymore and you can access it remotely.  Thatü__s increased functionality - not really all that smart.  Smarter?  Maybe. Smarter Than you? Debate able - If your pipes freeze itü__s a toss up."
"So when I say that I want to ""finish"" the basement, I'm not meaning that I want to put up drywall and make it into a real living space. The farthest my ideas have gone so far is for it to be a workshop and to wall off (with plenty of access) the steam boiler, hot water heater, and furnace so those wouldn't get damaged by sawdust, etc. And to clean up and repaint the walls.From all of the answers here, it's apparent that even though it's mostly dry, all of the walls probably have moisture issues that I need to deal with eventually. For now though, can I scrape and clean the walls and repaint them? If so, what type of paint should I be looking for?I'll also get a couple of quotes for fixing the moisture issues, but I have other higher priority projects right now, so that's going to have to wait."
"This is like being mad at Amazon for an item shipping later than expected or arriving and it being the wrong item, if it was purchased from a third party through the Amazon site.&amp;#x200B;It's fine to get upset at the customer service dept, but when the courier is late 4 hours you need to understand that there is nothing Wayfair can do about that. They use third party/manufacturer warehouses because it allows them to sell you that furniture for super cheap, the entire reason you bought from them in the first place. In some cases, buying the same item on Wayfair/Amazon will come from the same place.&amp;#x200B;When you go down the street to American Furniture Warehouse, they are paying a guy $12 per hour to set this flat pack Chinese made furniture up in the back. The quality is the same."
"Essentially in a modern three wire system there are two wires eventually leading back to ""ground"", which are the newer earth ground, and the neutral.  These wires are all tied together at the panel, and then the earth ground is attached to a couple of long copper rods which are driven into the ground.  This provides a path to ground in the case of a number of problems, including lightning strikes, neutral wire problems, device wiring problems, and so on.The neutral wire from the main panel goes back to the transformer (usually mounted on a telephone pole, or in a large green metal box), where is it ""neutral"" compared to the voltages stepped down from the higher voltage generated to transmit AC power over power lines.The neutral line is essentially the return path (or ground or drain for DC system in your car) for the completed circuit.  The equipment ground is completely unnecessary for the transmission of electrical power, and exists solely as a safety feature.  This is the reason why no electronics or basic science texts mention a third wire."
"I have been in the trades for a little over fifteen years. I'm the contractor other contractors call when they need something done right or something to big or complex for them to handle.    I have never advertised my services and most of my clientel comes from them referring people to me. I also teach master level and above courses at several tech schools around me and have contributed to more tech manuals regarding techniques used in my trade than I can honestly remember.    I am licensed, insured, and capable working in commercial and residential settings alike though, since commercial jobs pay more, I tend to concentrate my efforts there. I have flown all over the country and several other countries to do residential and commercial jobs for people and companies requesting my services.    But to answer your question from a consumer perspective alone, yes. I very much have done just that. Many, many,  times over now. It is even easier for me because I have a reputation among most contractors that I know my shit and the guys who try shady stuff don't usually want to do work for me.    I'm not a DIYer and I know when say, an electrician is moonlighting as a flooring contractor, or a carpenter is moinlighting as an electrician, or an unskilled person is trying to upsell his or her abilities.

"I'm from the Caribbean and that's what we build due to hurricanes. It's more expensive on the outset than wood, but it's more durable if done correctly. There are different ""levels"" of concrete building. To be most structurally sound, there should be rebar in EVERY set of 'columns' down the holes in the blocks. They should really have added poured concrete into the holes at that time as well. I know many homes skip those steps. Without it, the house isn't as structurally sound or even as sound against things like reason seeping through.Adding or moving electrical or plumbing will be issues. Not impossible - just a little more expensive and time consuming than wood frame house. Changing bigger things like doors and windows will be bigger issues, especially if the house was built well.Depending on where you live, insulation might be an issue. You don't have to worry as much about critters, but rodents and insects still can get in, so don't fool yourself into thinking they can't. Wood boards are often forgotten inside (especially around windows and doors) and can still attract termites. Rats can chew through solid concrete and only need a small hole to squeeze though.Your ""siding"" will last forever - just a matter of painting when your paint fades or you want a new color. So that's a plus."

Based on the part number on the housing it looks like you probably have a Steel-Craft (Chamberlain) Model 1150. Check out the [Owner's Manual](https://www.liftmaster.com/catalogresourcesv3/en-us/shared/files/tucmanuals/a1297m.pdf) for instructions on how to set your unit to a different frequency.
"Before leaping to conclusions, get the well water tested. You should probably do that anyway.

"Concrete companys make a product called flowable fill that could fill this and and take care of any compaction problems. It is delivered on a mixer truck  and should cost about $100-$150 per CY. Because you are in a crawl space, you will likely have to pump it, which would be an additional cost. "
"Do you have any idea how thick your rafters are?  2X8s?  2X10s?

Don't put too much stock into brand names. Buy what ever is on sale. As long as it doesnt have herbacide in it (weed and feed) it really doesn't have a shelf life so I stock up when it's on sale. My Lowes has Scott's Wintergard on sale right now so I just grabbed some and stuck it in the garage. 
"FYI blue tape is no different from masking tape. What you are looking for is safe release tape, it is used on freshly painted walls for striping and wainscoting.

I don't know why people are thinking that a home equity loan is going to be that difficult. Credit unions can probably loan at a pretty low rate with just an online appraisal at a pretty good rate.  Only issue is they may want you to close some of your lines of credit which wouldn't be a bad idea

I grew up in a home with an 18 foot (angled down to about 15) ceiling. There were three wooden beams in it and on one wall we had a large Verner Panton wall hanging that was approximately 5 feet wide by 8 feet high. I think a couple of large fabric wall hangings would work quite well for you too.
I have had sheet vinyl directly on my hydronic radiant floor since 1990.  Still good.  My recommendation for a 120 square foot space is single piece of  sheet vinyl cut leaving 1/2ü_ù space on the perimeter.  No adhesive.  Directly on the self level.  Edges held down by the base trim.  Good luck.

"When a contractor is being pushy to authorize the start of work, I'll say something like ""well, I'm waiting on a couple of other bids to come in first.""Other than that, contractors should assume they're competing for a project and shouldn't give horrible prices unless they don't want the work.

"ah yea i saw that as an option if this doesn't take care of it. Do you think it'll be effective on the first floor that's really an open floor plan?

"yep it's definitely over the leach field.  a new septic system was installed with the purchase of this home in july, the old tank was re-used (with a new green lid added), and the leach field is ~50' further away from the house, and the old leach field (close to the house and tank) was filled in."
"ü__JDü_ù refers to the shape of the glass part, it doesnü__t say anything about the base part.

"After letting it sit for the appropriate amount of time, run water (ideally a hose onto a driveway or somewhere you donü__t care about) as much as you can.  Donü__t do laundry for a few days, and filter your drinking water or let the chlorine evaporate before drinking.  Run a load or two of rags through the laundry first, and donü__t wash darks if those get damaged.If youü__re trying to get rid of a sulfur smell which happens more with hot water, youü__ll want to run enough hot water in the beginning to get the bleach into your hot water heater."
"I agree with everything said above.  I wouldn't expect the roofer to be able to know how to fix the water damage pictured, but I would be concerned that he was prepared to just cover it up and not tell you about it.  That would raise doubts about the rest of his workmanship, so something to keep an eye on as he completes the job.Get a framer or general contractor in to make the necessary structural repairs including replacing the top plate. Inspect the rest of the roof structure and make all of the necessary repairs before completing the roof."

I live in a suburban neighborhood where every house has an AP and every other house has a wifi mesh network.   The 2.4ghz spectrum is so crowded that I've gone through and used coax networking as a stop gap till I can build a box that of my own. It will only get worse as more people get more wifi access points and devices and clog up the less useful 5ghz spectrum.

"Kohler.   K-4197-0 toilet bowl with a K-4468-0 tank.  It will flush anything.  If you buy the bowl in a kit it comes with a 1.28 gpf tank, however it can and will accept the older 1.6 gpf tanks.  That little bit of extra water gives it some real power.  They installed one in my apartment and I was so impressed with it that I replaced the ones in my house with them.The only complaint I have is if you lay a really long one that ends up on the side above the water level it can take a couple flushes to remove the streak.  But absolutely no clogging!"

"Thanks for the detailed. Realized that I didn't explain myself very well and caused confusion. Please see the images link again and edit. I added more information which I hope helps. All 6 sockets wire through the main pole of the fixture.  Which are then wired together and then wired into the main cable that'll go into the ceiling. Thinking I wouldn't have proper room to wire it all together and stuff it into the main pipe I snipped them short. Now, I need to extend them again so properly wire it together before I wire in the main power cable. "
"Where do you live? Humidity can cause doors and door frames to swell, making it seem like something has shifted permanently, when it's actually seasonal.We moved into this house in the summer, during high humidity, and our front door was a bitch to open and close. Very tight and sticky. In the winter, it loosened up and was much easier to use. I'm not saying that's okay and you shouldn't do anything about it. But it might just be environmental.Tho, it is late in the year and humidity is dropping in most places. Might not be your issue. Cheers."
"Yes, it needs to be absolutely rock solid.  Zero give.You can patch that with compound.  No need to replace it.  Ceilings are not as critical to the eye as a wall.You definitely need to fix the fan.  Step one is to make sure the blades are level. You pick a spot on the tip of the blades, and make sure all of them are the same distance from the ceiling.  A blade that is 1/4"" out-of-plane will cause a large wobble at high speeds.Once the blades are parallel to the ceiling, then you can experiment with a fan balancing kit to get it wobble-free."
"you can take a box knife and score a line about a foot above the flood line, then the drywall should snap nicely where you cut. Then you can cut and remove the insulation that soaked up the water. (I'd start at a foot above the flood line, but you may need to cut more depending on how much mold there is). Once the studs are exposed, you can spray a mildew/mold killer. This is something you need to do ASAP, because it will just get worse. Replacing the insulation and drywall isn't as imminent, so you can save up to pay someone to make the repairs."
"Do some research before you buy, not just ""what's best"", but understand the product and what fails.  For a mechanical device it's often wear and corrosion.  Plastics prevent corrosion, but fatigue after a while.  Thoughtful use of the right plastics in the right places however is actually an improvement over all metal.  Well made things balance that out.  ie. you wouldn't buy a car just based on being most expensive and assume it's good. You'd also not just buy based on horsepower or weight.  You wouldn't buy from a brand with a poor reputation because people liked the model just this year.  You balance all those things out.  If you want to buy something that lasts 20 years, research it more like you would a car and factor all those things in, rather than buy it like a banana: organic or not."
"If I were building a model home to show people, I'd either hide the mechanicals well or remove whatever I could get away with to make it seem more roomy and less ugly.With basements, water issues are a matter of ""when"", not ""if."" You definitely want the sump pump, and it's a good idea to add a battery backup as well. Especially if you live in an area that gets moderate to heavy amounts of snow.A few weeks of rain isn't typically a threat as much as a melting snow, sewage backup, a busted water line, leaking appliance, etc. The exception is if you end up with a spot where the ground is not graded away from the house (could be from you mulching or from an animal digging), or a broken downspout.They wouldn't put it there just during construction. So it's a permanent fixture. Be thankful :-) lol."
"Lol. It was a beautiful area and a great price. When I moved in I realized the structure made an insanely loud noise when the weight of an individual walked across the floor to the tune of 65 decibels. The neighbors upstairs keep me up past midnight every night with constant walking over my bedroom only. I have no idea what any human being can do in a 12 by 12 room constantly walking for over 4 hours every night but they do it. The condo association is telling me to go fuck myself (long story short) and the neighbors upstairs have told two blatant outrageous lies about me at the board meetings. Why? I don't know, I consistently say it isn't their fault and accuse them of nothing. So I have gotten 4-5 hours of sleep for over a year now. I feel physically ill all day long and I'm always exhausted. "
"My house is from 1915, and this a battle I fight every year.  You want to focus on controlling drafts, that's typically the easiest and fastest (and cheapest) way to help.  Walk around with some incense or something that puts off a little smoke.  Stick it around windows, electrical outlets / light switches, doors, and just walk around and stand in between rooms.  If there's a draft, you can tell.&amp;#x200B;\-First of all, the plastic window wrap is huge if you don't have new windows.  You may have other drafts around the casing, but old windows are so leaky this is a must.\-Put up some curtain rods over all your exterior doors, put up blankets.  Even light blankets help some.

"You might get a fair amount of mileage from removing his downspout and removing what you can from the first elbow. From my experience this is where the majority of the leaf debris will be. From there I would take a garden hose with a small nozzle attachment and try and snake it through from both ends to try and wash it out.I would try and work with him on it and say that it's impacting both of your houses. Be the good neighbor and offer to help with the potential problem that you are aware of and don't get all accusey on him.It might work better with a longer stand pipe on the downspout to build up pressure and push debris through.That said, if this is the really really thin accordion pipe, that stuff is trash and probably has collapsed. Generally that is for surface redirecting.Good luck"
"the windows are all done with arches, this was done flat.

"Get two boards, preferably oak or another hardwood from the home center.  Get them in 1ü_ù x 4ü_ù and as long as needed to span the studs.  Screw them horizontally to the studs so that the upper and lower fastener holes on the bracket fall roughly in the center of the upper and lower boards.  This way, you can slide the bracket along the length of the newly mounted boards to the center of the wall and mount the TV.  I recommend oak or another hardwood because it is much denser than pine or other softwoods and will be able to securely hold the bracket fasteners and TV.    I would use lag screws to attach the boards to the studs (2ü_ù?) and then shorter lag screws to mount the bracket to the boards (1ü_ù).  They will still go through the boards into the drywall behind, but should easily be able to be filled.  I would use two lags for each end of each board for 8 total and whatever is needed for the bracket.  Just my suggestion, Iü__m sure there will be others.  The lag screws should have a fairly thick shank and a hex head.  Youü__ll need to predrill."
"If the realtor is trying to use the ü__good old boyü_ù network to expedite a sale, then they have plenty of other tells to give away that they donü__t care about their client. The majority of the realtors I inspect for regularly would rather their clients have a good home than just close on the first house they take some interest in, and theyü__re grateful to me for watching out for them. Iü__ve had other buyers whose realtor is just a complete tool, the house had all kinds of issues and their agent kept trying to downplay everything I was finding. I left while the agent was trying to spin all the stuff I told his clients about, but called the buyers later that day to try and point them in the right direction. They had never bought a home before and didnü__t know what to expect and werenü__t happy with their agent but didnü__t know why recourse they had. I talked to them a few times and they ended up finding a much better house a few weeks later.tl;dr Not every inspector is a self serving douche thatü__s just looking to cheat and manipulate people"
"Where does the water around your house travel though, are you in a valley or on top of a rise? Or are you on generally flat land? The question about whether it is a water table/drainage issue really depends on a larger area than the ground right around your unit. The water running off the parking lots goes somewhere, is it into an underground system, or out onto the ground or in a drainage swale? Same thing for the downspouts from your gutters. Are there buildings that are at a higher elevation than yours? From what it sounds like, the water from just your roof is probably not causing all of your problems, although it could be if your gutters are full and the water is just running down the side of the building to your foundation. I'd be looking at whether you're in a low spot where the water table is high, or if any other water is getting to your unit. If it was just a grading issue, you'd probably have water in your unit more often than 5 times in 4 years. It's likely that the grading is not optimal, but there is likely another contributing factor."
"In the span of a year, our microwave, washing machine, and range all bit the dust. I've been a renter most of my life, so the last five years have been revelatory in terms of appliances. Microwave: initially one of those things I didn't really care about (I reheat food occasionally, don't cook in it). Now that I have a new aesthetically pleasing box in which to reheat my dinner, life is good. It's an LG, one of the ones with no buttons on the outside.  Our Maytag washing machine is blowing my mind in that my clothes actually come out clean. Why did no one tell me this would happen? YMMV, because this is my first front loader HE. I take care to dry the seal and the soap dispenser after each wash, so far nothing smells like death mold.Lastly, the range. Previous homeowners were cheapskates who didn't spring for a gas line, so we're the only ones in the neighborhood with electric. Turns out this isn't so bad, as I opted for induction which is cooking with magnets and therefore AWESOME. The (electric) oven has a convection function as well as a bread proofing setting so things are feeling like the 21st century in my tiny kitchen. I don't feel like any of these things are necessarily ""luxury,"" but simply having things do what they're supposed to without my having to swear at them seems luxurious. "
"Table Saw: I will certainly review the Grizzly table saw. It looks like the cast iron Jet is $1600, $600 more than the Grizzly. I am by no means a pro, just want something that can withstand being beat up the next 20 years, while still maintaining its quality. I'll check out the used cabinetry saws; I have a buddy that likes to tinker so cleaning one up could be a fun project. Mitre Saw: I have many projects where I think a mitre saw will  be handy: large deck, shed, building interior walls, and residing the entire house. With my limited space, I'll need a decent mobile saw I can take outside for projects. I am hopeful I can find a good deal on Black Friday. Modular table: Thanks for the link. Thats exactly what I am thinking. Keep a shelf of the various table top tools and switch them in/out of a base on wheels. Jointer: Great video! Thanks for sharing. I may make you a bit more jealous, but I have a place not too far from me to get great lumber: [http://www.peachstatelumber.com/](http://www.peachstatelumber.com/)Now that you bring it up, I'll give them a call and ask them if they surface the sides. If that's the case, I wont need a jointer. But, I do like the Grizzly you listed. How often do you use yours?Nailers: I didn't look at the cost of the pneumatic. I'll check it out and compare. "
"This has been my personal experience with maintenance and construction in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Im not a contractor, but Iü__ve done a lot of work in the field of rentals. Probably has errors, so please feel free to correct me. I havenü__t messed with radiant flooring that much, so Iü__ll just say to make the connectors accessible with wall or floor panels. Two major things, figuring out the best setup for maintenance. And setting it up for all your future potential plans for the place and see to it that they are all built in. Like, If you ever think to have someone there like a parent that needs live-in care, wheelchair accessibility, bigger hallways and doors are great. For maintenance. All major plumbing connections should have easy access for repairs. The bathtub plumbing is major here, design it so that the back goes into a closet or some cubby so you can have an access without tearing out the tub surround or drywall. (Make that shower head tall, for everyoneü__s sake) also, bad water pressure is annoying, so research your pipe sizes, elevations, and couplings. Designing rooms with plumbing on inner walls back to back with other rooms that use water cuts the cost of pipes, probably keeps pressure up, and is all around more efficient. having a tall crawl space does wonders for your pipe management and future maintenance. Is this an apartment that sits on top of a garage? In my opinion, thatü__s one of the best ideas since all the accesses are easier, stay in a clean area, and you get a garage. Vaulted our attic? Ceiling insulation is easier with an attic, and is one of the biggest heat losses. You can blow in twice as much as you need, itü__ll settle a little, but I hear time and time again how people blow in extra and immediately see a difference on their heating bill.An attic makes electrical and ductwork really easy, running all the cables through the attic and dropping them down into walls is nice if you go the radiant floor route. 36ü_ù doors and 4ü__ hallways are amazing for moving too. Led bulbs will pay for themselves in the long run.For plumbing, Pex is easy to work with, (donü__t be lazy, use red for hot, and blue for cold all the way through, and itü__s awesome to wrap all the red in foamInsulation) itü__s cheap, and efficient. But if itü__s a crawlspace, I think rodents go after it faster than copper.If you go that route, buy the crimp tool and fit them cheap as you go, shark bite fittings are great for fast repairs, but the cost adds up quick. All water areas, Bathroom, kitchen and utility, are notorious water problems and sub floor fixes are a nightmare. I would avoid doing vinyl flooring since itü__s a hassle to redo with renters since they tend to not pay attention to a leak until itü__s too late. Particle board is bulges up so you know there is a leak, but inevitably cost a lot of time and money to replace, Using waterproof click-lock flooring is easy to install and remove if you go vinyl. I love a good tile bathroom, and when you go through all the steps, it seems to be the most water tight, just do the research, the under layers are the most important. Use semi-gloss paint for water areas to improve the wall seal and make it easier to clean. The rest of the house can go eggshell. (Flat white for the other ceilings is normal to cut off on lighting glares.)Waterproof click-lock can be great for the whole house. But renters moving furniture across it isnü__t always pretty. You can go with a hardwood click-lock for the rest for some better durability. Carpet has a bad rap sometimes, but itü__s cheap, nice on your feet, keeps the noise and dust down, and furniture rarely hurts it. For &lt;500sf, even expensive options arenü__t that bad. Just keep in mind that nothing is stronger than a renters potential negligence. I havenü__t messed with countertops, but I wouldnü__t do anything expensive for the same reasons, though Iü__ve seen some great thick hardwood ideas, those are cool since you can sand and refinish them. Top mount sinks&gt;bottom mountMake your window holes based on ü__stockü_ù window sizes for the manufacturer that you plan to buy from. Theyü__ll have them in-stock, and cheaper then something thatü__s in-between. Make them 1/4 in bigger all around. If you have a large window(4ü__ wide)If you go with lap siding, use wide trim and and put trim on first. Donü__t butt the siding to the window, leaks are easier to fix if youü__ve got room to work without tearing off siding. All in all, bet on only finding out about problems AFTER they move out, since you probably wonü__t be told that the ceiling has a leak until water is actually dripping on something they care about. The building codes for your area are probably dry, but even if you have a contractor, check them out. It will be easier to understand why you can and canü__t do things. "

"I think the disconnect is coming in that u/Banshay originally said that the solar panels were ""worthless"", which is not correct.Then I think people were using ""depreciation"" in three different ways (all correct in their own way, but with some important differences where they end up conflicting)."

"I'd think you'd still need to drill through the top plate. A short flex bit can be handy here, but you'll still need holes in the wall and ceiling to get your hands in and guide the cable or a fish tape through that drilled hole. Flex bits are flexible but not so much to make that tight of a bend."
"I'm mainly concerned with sound traveling up through vents. You can someone very clearly when they are in basement if you're near a vent (and it's a small home so a vent is always close by).I know footsteps and stuff will be heard. That's not too big of a deal (thoght wouldn't hurt to minimize)."
"If it is leaking, then replace it. They are not expensive. If you replace it, put a ball shutoff valve on both the cold water inlet and the hot water outlet. It makes it so you never have to turn off the gas to the water heater and also the ball valves are far superior to gate valves in every way."
"It looks like your condensate pan has developed and leak and the yellowish color is watered-down rust.  It needs to be sealed.That Flexseal that's been advertised to death on TV actually works really well in this situation.  It is easy to apply, seals well, and is about as goof-proof as it gets."
"It will ""work"" until it starts making things worse and then gums it up and makes it more crummy than it started. It's not intended as a lubricant and that's pretty well known. That's not what is meant to be used for and it will not do a good job for more than a very brief window.It's bad advice."
"Just a thought, but have an electrician come out and do it right.Our house didn't have 3 prong outlets either.

Listen to u/D-Dubya. It takes a lot of air volume to blow water out. Picture your portable compressor blowing out perhaps 30% of the water before the air simply bypasses the water. After the air is off? the water pools to fill the pipe in the low spots allowing it to burst the pipe when it freezes
"Makes sense! Thank you.The nut from the original valve didn't come off, and I figured it was OK to keep (I didn't want to force it). I'd prefer to replace the entire valve including the nut and compression seal, but as I said, I'm nervous about forcing it if and denting/bending the copper pipe. "

"Obligatory warning: it's both smart and required by law to call a plumber.Obligatory warning number two: if you have threaded rigid pipe you're connecting to, you probably actually have to call a plumber.

This is certainly the correct answer. The only other way would be use toggle bolts if there is enough room between the drywall and the concrete. 4 toggle bolts can hold up a ridiculous amount of weight. Source: I work in A/V and we hang hundreds of TVs a year on many many many different surfaces.

You can try an RV Storage Heater.  They are meant to keep the interior above freezing to prevent pipes bursting and also help with moisture.  It may be difficult to keep a greenhouse above freezing during a cold snap because of little insulation unless you put a few blankets on top of it at night.
"i felt all the walls in the area the burner was in and everything was dry, the leak is outside the burner area, so i think it was two different issues (maybe the high winds this weekend blew it out? i saw that *could* cause it, although it is unlikely)also, the burner was dry when i took it out."
mothballs don't do a thing to stop rodents. I saw a video of someone's attic where their solution to pest control was to cover the entire thing in at least an inch of mothballs. Rats were just running around paying no mind to them. They're also carcinogenic and can be deadly for pets and children.
"Found a moving sale and bought 2-40 lbs bags of deicing salt for $3!

"Good advice!As we've painted remodeled our old home we've made sure to replace all the outlets, switches, and light fixtures.

"I have had nests at several homes and do not think they are worth the money. In my experience across Nest products, the company greatly overstates the intelligence and learning capability of their thermostats. There is a lot of potential for a thermostat that ACTUALLY learns about your home, your habits, the weather, etc. - Nest doesn't do that.The only thing I liked about Nest was the ability to control the temperature from anywhere in my house via my phone.  But there are now far cheaper thermostats on the market that will allow you to do that."

"Ideally, if you live in an area that has winter, your outdoor faucets should be frostproof. This means that the valve handle extends indoors and the actual valve is in a warm place. Older homes wonü__t have these. If you do have a frostproof outdoor faucet you just neeeed to remove the hose so it doesnü__t trap water where it can freeze. If you do NOT have a frostproof faucet you need to shut the water off indoors. There is usually a valve near where the pipe comes into the house.

"\&gt; noticed that an unrelated area of the roof was leaking.

"&gt; However, I have always heard if it is kept on low during the day and then only turned up at night it would use less power This is a common myth that is not true. Turning off the heat during the day will definitely lower your electricity bill--it cuts back on your energy consumption both by cutting back on the amount of time your heater is running and by allowing your heater to be most energy-efficient (running full blast, instead of popping on for a few minutes numerous times throughout the day). The same goes for running your air conditioning during the summer. The only time it would be financially worth it to run your heater during the day would be if you are worried about your pipes freezing. However, if 60 degrees is the coldest it's getting during the day, that's not an issue for you. "
"Color is very important especially if the fixture is LED and the bulbs are typically not replaceable.  Color can also vary by manufacturer even when they have the same Kelvin rating.Halo SLD is also available as a 3500K LED.  Fairly neutral and bright. The 3500K SLD was harder to find and they cost more.  Hard to find other bulbs in this temperature for matching it (especially a screw in bulb that is dimmable).  But, I'm really liking 3500K as our new ""household standard"" and hope more manufactures offer bulbs in this color temperature.We purchased one each of the SLD in 3000K, 3500K and 4000K and tested them (jury rigged up on a ladder) and really liked the 3500K The extra test lights went into closets replacing the existing florescent tube recessed light -- actually like the 4000K in a closet."
"For the wall: spackle, putty knife, mud pan, sanding block (120 grit), paint to match. The small cans of spackle (8oz) should be plenty. Get a 6"" ish sized putty knife and a mud pan to match in size. For the trim: wood filler, sanding block, paint to match.Total cost should be about $40 not including the paint. Look up videos on how to patch drywall, it's not too difficult, just requires time and sometimes multiple coats. Always make sure to spread the spackle beyond the damaged part to make it a smooth transition. The wood will be trickier to fix, basically you'll be trying to use the wood filler to mold the baseboard back to it's original shape. I think the wall you could do, but you may need the baseboards replaced, and if you're not too handy, that may be beyond what you're comfortable with."
"Is the linoleum a single sheet or the glued down tile size? Is the basement water proof?  IE: do you have moisture?  Sump?  Pouring a concrete layer over the existing floor will be quite a job and unless it is reasonably thick you would risk cracking.  If the linoleum is secure I would leave it and put new flooring over it.  Removing old linoleum is not an easy task at all.  There are solvents you can use but still a huge time consuming job.  You have to score the old linoleum so the solvent can penetrate then scrape, scrape and scrape some more.  Being a basement you have to be conscious of potential moisture so selecting a new flooring will be critical.  They make many new linoleum type products that look like wood, tile over even concrete that are waterproof and suitable to use in a basement."
"Make a first box (or three). The ones that go to the new place first, brought in by you as soon as you have access. It should have toilet paper, plunger, shower curtain (if there isn't one in the new house), basic toiletries, a basic toolbox, cleaning supplies, garbage bags, any important medication you may need daily, phone chargers and one change of clothes. I also recommend a couple of plates, cups or large water bottles and cutlery - enough for the number of people helping you move. Consider immediately getting curtains for your bedroom or at least a sheet for the first night. Basically think of the things you use every day - have that handy. If you'll be in the house for a while before furniture arrives bring camping/folding chairs or something to sit on during breaks other than the floor. "
"Before I knew this lino was through the house, I hired some carpet guys to come in and do the bedrooms and hallway in the upstairs. I had a home inspection prior to buying the house...but he didn't list that on his report. Anyway, I was away out of the country and my wife let them in to do the work. She took some pictures of the lino and showed me after I got home and the job was done as more of a ""oh look this is interesting"" not knowing about the potential. The lino was all in tact and there wasn't glue or anything on top of it. Just the old underlay and carpet. My concern was that the carpet guys nailed those strips of spikes down along the edge baseboards. Probably three little skinny nails per strip. I watched some youtube videos on it and most guys don't seem to give much care to this sort of thing. Many others that care a bit said as long as underlay is going over the lino and the carpet on top of that it is pretty safe. At this point the carpet is in...but of course I worry about things a bit.

"Ok, what you're asking makes more sense now. Yeah, there's supposed to be drainage down there. Mason should've had weeping tile (fabric wrapped perforated pipe) all along the bottom of that wall buried in gravel and tied into the downspout discharge out to the street (or at the absolute bare minimum, running into a dry well). I see a drain grate right there in the driveway that likely has a discharge pipe he could've tapped into, so absolutely no excuses for him not to have done that. Your ideal solution is to dig up all along the border and add that. At the *very* least, you're gonna have to dig it up, add gravel, then drill weep holes through some of the mortar... and if you have to do that *anyway*, you may as well just do it right and add the weeping tile. I'm also curious if there's a footer or some kind of aggregate under there. I mean... this guy didn't just slap together a brick wall on top of dirt with no drainage and expect it to hold up, did he? That would just be catastrophically stupid. The thing would be falling over within two years."
"To replace the plate, you would need to create a support inside the attic by nailing a 2x4 along the underside of the rafters that are resting on the damaged plate. Then cut another 2x4 the same length and nail it directly under that last 2x4 but resting on the beams that make up the floor of your attic. Then cut individual 2x4s, one side which is 90 degrees to rest on the 2x4 on the floor and the other end at an angle (which is going to be the same as the pitch of your roof) and nail it underneath the long 2x4 you nailed to the rafters. Over support stuff under each rotten rafter. This creates a bracing system that will take the load of the roof when you remove the rotten plate.Then, cut out the nails joining the rotten rafters to the plate. Then cut out the plate. The bracing system will hold the rafters in place. Slide a new plate into place, fasten it in, nail in your sister rafters to the rotten rafters and to the new plate, then remove the bracing system and you're good to go.Roofer isn't responsible for damaged framing due to water damage."
"Do what you want, its your health and the health of your family you are risking (I saw this as an energy auditor and former insulation installer who has encountered several homeowners who removed vermiculite DIY and were carrying oxygen tanks around or had a husband who died of lung cancer), but I'm gonna tell you best practice.Don't bother getting it tested. There is no way to conclusively disprove that your vermiculite contains asbestos. Its quite possible that one bag of a certain brand of vermiculite containing asbestos was used in one part of the attic, and bags that didn't contain asbestos were used in the area you test. Best practice: remove it all using a professional remediation company. Then you will have a clean attic which will be easy to properly air seal and insulate. The thing about vermiculite is - its actually a pretty good insulator and makes a pretty effective air barrier if its more than 3"". You are better of leaving it undisturbed if you don't want to do the proper thing and get it removed professionally. Consider this: You don't air seal and blow insulation on top of the vermiculite, covering it up. Someone else buys your house years down the line and decides to tear out parts of a ceiling or install recessed lights. They now unwittingly have exposed their house to asbestos."
"The type of siding you have is either called channel siding, or dutch lap/german siding. Can't quite tell which from the picture, those are both similar styles. Any decent lumberyard will either stock or be able to order those styles of siding for you, they still exist and are used--my 1920 house has dutch lap siding, and I've patched areas with new pine replacement dutch lap, it's a perfect match. Your issue is that the wood siding goes right into the ground, and that's a problem. Wood siding will not last that close to the ground, so you should really consider using an alternative to wood on the lower courses. There's a company called Boral which is the only company (that I've been able to find) that makes true to dimension copies of channel/dutch lap siding in a wood composite material. Check this out: http://www.boralamerica.com/truexterior/truexterior-sidingOne of those is very likely a match for your siding. That stuff is rated for ground contact, so it can touch the dirt forever and be fine. It's not cheap though....so you might want to use it for the areas that are 1-2' above grade, and use the wood higher than that. One more tip-if you order the pine stuff from a lumberyard, get the pre-primed option!! It's really annoying to pre-prime AND paint that type of siding. I speak from experience."

All pellet stoves have hoppers and an auger to continuously deliver pellets into the burn chamber. Only a handful of pellets are burning at any given time (they work more like an oil burner than a wood stove in that respect). Most pellet stoves have hoppers that are big enough for 1-2 days of heat.
"As everyone else said, mitigate any water or moisture problems outside first. Next step, use a wire brush to get old paint off, use a concrete etching solution.

"If I had that problem I would build a stud wall on the room side of the stair stringers and have it go back to meet the wall in the back of the house.

"Putting in a GFCI if there isn't one - you can do that even if you don't have a ground wire - would be preferred, as it would make it safer.The downside is that GFCIs are prone to nuisance trips on outdoor lights because you get small amounts of current leakage all over the place and it adds up.

"Take some low grit sandpaper and take off any buildup under the flapper. If you see the water ü__dancingü_ù on top after itü__s full you still have a leak somewhere.

"Thanks and yea so far that's the best I can come up with. Wish they explained their reasoning so at least I could latch onto that. You would think that all the other expansion area would suffice, but maybe it's just to cut responsibility for honoring the warranty around trickier installation areas."
"That house may have been 90 years old. But Iü__d doubt the ducts were. Unless itü__s a mansion?  Most homes had no AC until the 50ü__s and I thought most homes had radiant heat up to the 30ü__s.

"The reason to not buy those things at home Depot/Lowe's is because most of the time they will carry the toilet, but no replacement parts. Usually I suggest Kohler toilets, or Mansfield if you're looking at a little cheaper. Are you looking for round or enlongated? Standard height or comfort height?"
"The thing is you have to babysit the pool daily (dump skimmer, run the robot) and test and balance chemicals as well as maybe add water.  If you are old this might just be too hard for them to do.

"This is totally my mindset and I like the more ""modern"" look of white built-ins.

This is what I would do. It doesnü__t have to be pretty. It just needs to be solid enough to stay sealed. But the good duct sealant that has fibers in it. It is way more durable and will save your butt in this situation. Just try to smooth it out nicely so it is less noisy as air moves through it. 
"Those things last forever.  I bought a Genesis from the 90's off Craigslist for $50 six years ago.  Its still works like new with no rust, just needs new flavorizor bars.

"We recently installed vinyl plank with backing in several rooms, right over the subflooring. Itü__s great! Just make sure that the floor is VERY clean and free of debris.

"Yea thanks. It was a stupid, stupid mistake. I had every intention of inserting a 2 inch pipe into drain pipe to avoid this exact problem and just didnt. No clue why I skipped that step.

"You might be losing heat from via your feet contacting the floor via conduction.

"another note to take, when you figure out where your walls will be, make sure you have all your plumbing supply and waste lines as close to center in the walls as possible. i am assuming they are stubbed up out of your concrete floor, if your wall is a bit off, there is no moving those pipes! lol.

well I don't live in Canada so I'm unfamiliar with the permitting processes. But I can assure you plenty of people have done this successfully.

"All up to what you wish to do. You can insulate the walls and ceilings with fiberglass like I did, or you can do sprayed insulation. Common drywall doesn't really add any insulation value, it'd be more for a finished look.You can also add insulating foam on the outside of the garage under the siding (highly expensive though).But simply insulating and ensuring you have good doors and seals will be enough to notice a difference.With heat inside, it'll stay. Summer time, it'll be cooler than outside, and with a air conditioner it'll be fantastic."
"Don't use a saw for most of the demolition. Use a utility knife to score a section of drywall, parallel to the ceiling joists, then bash along the score line with a hammer held sidewise, busting the drywall upwards and apart. When you have a starting hole in the drywall, you can grab and pry it from the ceiling in sections. Put the scrap directly into bags or trash cans and haul it outside, skipping the part where it gets dumped onto the floor in a huge mess. If you bring down a large piece of drywall, score it and fold it over so it's more compact."
"Honestly, it's a fantastic product. Don't knock it if you haven't tried it. I don't pretend it's hardwood or that it will fool most people into thinking it's hardwood. That's not the point. It's versatile, resilient, comfortable, and durable. In many respects, it's frankly a lot better than hardwood. Looks nice too, to me anyway. I wouldn't trade my vinyl floors for anything, not even if you paid me. My goal is to eventually have every floor in this house replaced with LVP or LVT. It's not cheap though. Which is probably where the ""luxury"" comes in."
"It is more like $68/sq. ft because they are demolishing the current garage first. So it is 1100SF of unfinished space, but it is insulated and drywalled. I guess they only have to do concrete flat work for 600SF.  I would recommend the OP get two more bids from different companies. I had four bids on my house and there was a 20% spread. This was apples to apples with matching allowances and an architect run bid process. This would also allow OP to see how the line items match up and see where he is spending the money. I am not surprised by the bid."
"Look into low viscosity epoxy resin gravity fed crack injection.Done incorrectly without the correct equipment will cause failure.Also consider having a core sample taken after the repair to ensure structural integrity. Despite the risk it's not difficult to do but the correct steps need to be taken. Had a lot of failures in my city due to incompetence and people jumping on the money train after earthquake.Edit. You may need pressure injection and its not a small job. The entire crack needs to be exposed (inside the house, under carpet etc) "
"So I deal with construction a little bit in Iowa (and several other states) and this is insane, even for private residential.2 line items stick out the most to me, which are the concrete (I just ran it through a cost estimate for Waterloo and it came out about $8,000 high, even with a very healthy markup built in) and ""building materials.""  He already has the cost of the materials more than built into the prices of each line item, including all of his overhead, and then has the audacity to include an almost $10k ""builder's fee.""  Screw this guy."
"That looks like oak.  I just had about 1,900 sq ft in a 1937 home professionally sanded and finished for 2,800 and it came out wonderfully.  I would highly recommend saving the floors if you can, since it is hard to find wood that nice these days.Iü__d strip all the tile before making a decision though, since water stains may ruin your plans in a kitchen.If you donü__t keep it, at least donate it to an architectural salvage shop in your area instead of throwing it out, people are always looking to match original wood that is no longer available."
"Why are there four plates?  That looks unusual with that single stud underneath.Electrical: If support isn't a problem,  you could notch the 2 x 4 plates with a wood chisel, then put the wires in the notch and cover them with [protection plates](https://www.lowes.com/pd/USP-2-in-x-5-in-Protection-Plate/3374518).  Then use a [box extender](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Electrical-Box-Extender-BE1-2/202708650).Edit:  Why are you asking about the electrical when there appears to be an EMT bender in the picture right beside the sheetrock sanding pole?"
"they might be common at camp sites, but outside of that, you'll likely never encounter a 30amp 120v plug in the wild.  like if you pull up to a neighbors house or something.  I guess it depends where you think you'll be most often.  If you go places with 30amp plugs, than keep on that path.  I wonder if someone makes a circuit that can accept a 30amp or 2x15amp  that would be neat.110v, 120v, 125v, all pretty much the same thing.  Most devices will accept all 3 indiscriminately.  I believe the spec is that 120v devices should accept 110v-135v.  "
"Fair question. I did a little research before committing, but Iü__m no expert. I live in Portland, Oregon, but even with all that rain, youü__re right, humid air is still the primary culprit for moisture.The main reason I went ahead with this plan was that pine needles and mulch were gathering around the vents and blocking airflow. The vents all had screens already. Considering the inspector sees a lot of houses around here, I did put a lot of stock into his recommendation. He really only talked about the benefits of the wells improving airflow and not blocking it. I guess my thought is that airflow in a crawlspace is dictated more by movement of warm/cold air than by wind outside or anything like that.As a new homeowner, Iü__m open to learning more about this stuff if you have a different idea. "
"Obviously it depends on the opener, my guess is you can probably reuse the mounting brackets on the ceiling and on the door itself but you will need to replace the main rail, belt and drive unit. Sensors may or may not need to be replaced. The opening button might work or might need to be swapped out but you should be able to use the same wiring at least.Overall, replacing a garage door opener is not particularly expensive or difficult DIY project. Figure a few hours, maybe less if you are familiar with the process and/or have a helper.Before attempting any of that, make sure the door is installed and balanced properly with the opener detached. If you can't open or close the door very easily by hand, fix that first. It should require very little effort to move and it should balance part way open."
"The US NEC states 6 ft from every doorway, and every 12 ft along the walls after that.  That is the absolute bare minimum, and kinda sucks lol.  My 1950 house met that Code, but it had very few outlets.Better to place them slightly closer to the door, and then place them about every 6 ft after that.  Its what I did when I rewired, never a need for an extension cord now!For most bedrooms with 10-15 ft walls, 2 -3 equally spaced outlets will mean you have an outlet almost anywhere you need.In corners where you expect to put a TV, lamp, desk, etc., place 1 outlet 1-2 ft from the corner.There is a BIG difference between code minimum and what feels good and is useful.  I used spray paint to mark outlets, and then walked the rooms placing imaginary furniture to see if they were placed right or not."
"&gt;So I recently took on the project of cleaning out and restoring a hoarder's house.If you're not getting some form of benefit for doing so (cash, reduced rent, etc) then why are you taking on someone elses problem?..I'm a flooring guy. Carpet will be fucked (i.e brittle as hell) if it even survives bleaching - the latex in the backings won't survive it and it'll start falling apart.OP, if an enzymatic cleaner run through a hot water extraction method of carpet cleaning (i.e generally the most expensive method but the best by far) doesn't work there's literally nothing you can do. Standard carpet shampoo rental machines are shit tier for carpet cleaning.If it's beyond even that, then it'd be beyond anything but a full replacement. Carpet remnants can be had for relatively cheap (if it's just a room you can literally get remnants from stock rolls for around 25% of RRP if there's an outlet near you that has them), but the cost of renting let alone outright buying gear gets quite close to what you'd pay for a carpet installer to fit it for you."
"I was planning to allow future access by framing the ducts in with removable panels. The enclosure would mainly be to support the insulation and keep it from crushing the (presumably) flex duct, and to give the insulation a nice shelf to rest on and stay put. It wouldn't be major, permanent structural framing.The chopped insulation is...yeah. I hate the stuff, but it seems like the best option. I just don't think I can afford a full attic worth of batting. I'll probably use batting on the top/sides of the duct plenum to guarantee it goes where it needs to. I'm not looking forward to future work up there, but that's one reason I want to do the ducts now. I'll probably start another thread asking what things I should do in the attic before I bury it in fluff.The air handler is out in the garage (ugh) for the time being. I'm putting together long term plans for my HVAC system, but for right now I need to seal up my ducts and insulate my attic. Filtration is an important item I want to address, and will be improving in the next iteration of HVAC work."
"Yes, you would probably need new bits for the impact driver.  There are a couple of things with an impact driver:You want to get ""impact rated"" bits.  Typically it will say it somewhere on the package.  An impact driver puts a lot more torque (twist) on a bit than a normal driver, so some bits (especially cheap ones) can break/shatter under certain circumstances.Also, the impact driver (at least that DeWalt one) will only take 1/4"" hex bits.  Any bits you have with a rounded shank (part that goes into the driver) or that isn't a 1/4"" hex won't work.  The nice thing though about the 1/4"" hex thing is once you have those bits, changing bits (like from drill to screw driver) is really quick and easy.Here are some drill bits I've used:https://smile.amazon.com/Bosch-9-Piece-Impact-Titanium-TI9IM/dp/B01H0NV5GM/Here's a pretty good screwdriving set:https://smile.amazon.com/Bosch-Piece-Impact-Screwdriving-SBID32/dp/B071VD42S9/and then I got this nut driver set:https://smile.amazon.com/DEWALT-DW2235IR-5-Piece-Magnetic-Nutsetter/dp/B003JQJYHM/"

Because I installed several of them in my house (for the bathroom fan) and more than being satisfied, this one doesnü__t ask for an extra live wire. Why is it important? Because not all switches carry an extra live wire, so you could end up confused and looking for something that isnü__t there. Plus it makes the installation a little more complicated. Probably some other timer/switch donü__t ask for that extra wire, but I donü__t know them. After having to bring the first one I bought back to the store for that very reason, I bought that one, which works perfectly.Thatü__s what this timer looks like (itü__s a dimmer but itü__s similar): https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FH02MAR_DIMSWI_01-2.jpgThatü__s what you get with a timer asking an extra live wire: https://blog.recessedlighting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Install-dimmer-switch.jpgI recommend you test the timer before closing everything. If itü__s installed incorrectly it wonü__t work, which can happen if all the wires are the same colour. Ground is ground and easy to differentiate but the rest can be confusing. But donü__t worry, it wonü__t go boom. Just wonü__t work :)"

Call them and they should send you a new one. Scary thing is a lot of units are failing and locking open. If it is the same panel as the liftmasters it also handles the remote control functions.

"Hard to know for sure but probably one or more of the following:- didn't sand the wood smooth enough at the beginning- using too thick of a roller nap- going over the paint again and again as it's drying- pressing too hard when rolling- putting 2nd coat on too early- bad/wrong/separated paint"

"I did a lot of renovations on my brick house when I bought it, including adding a window to the back of my house (it was there originally, then bricked over to add a faux fireplace, which I removed).

"I never understood this evangelism. The vast majority of people use WD40 for an issue because it is immediately available.

I second this.  I just installed 900sqft in my basement over the summer.  It was incredibly easy.  I would recommend using a table saw and miter saw instead of the the recommended utility knife.  While it is possible to cut it with a utility knife your wrist and hands will thank you for using a saw.

I wish my shop class was that hands-on. I would have loved to dive into that variety of projects.

"I would say to try and dry it out with a portable heater and then use some heavy duty cleaner to clean out the stains. The cement/grout will probably not clean up as much as the tiling will.

"I'm planning to demo a bathroom this week as well. It's got plaster walls and ceiling though, so going to be bit more messy than normal.

Negligible chance a disabled person will ever use that room and even then it still shouldn't be done.  100% chance prospective new owners will complain if the outlets are anything other than the height they are in other parts of the house.

"Nope, you are fine.  The coils froze over.  Same thing happens to refrigerators and freezers, as well.  Let it thaw, and you can turn it back on.But check on it occasionally.  I don't suppose it has a filter, does it?  Poor air flow and low freon are the two most common reasons for this to happen."
"Not just long run, but the condition of those pipes(is it corroded cast iron),  and the amount of fall you have.If you have bare min fall or bellies in the line, less GPF means better chance of a train of material building up. Also the habits you have - the type of TP you buy and how much you use."
"One easy way to tell that it is not load bearing is if it runs in the same direction as the joists above it. If it runs perpendicular to the joists, it is often load bearing, but not always.

"The old windows that were there were ugly, but there are lot of nice more traditional styles I could have gone with.  I didn't feel bad getting rid of the old ones themselves because they were trashed and weren't original to the house anyway.  But the style I went with definitely isn't for everyone!"
"This can cause a mess on baseboard trim if the paint is too heavy. Paint might drip onto the baseboard. I usually let it dry, then use a box cutter or exact-o blade to cut along the tape edge and prevent peeling off the new paint.So either way can work. Practice painting at someone elseü__s house."
"Those gaps are HUGE. But big enough that spray foam contractor could air seal, I think. Then gently cut away any escaped foam. If you are willing to paint, spray foam is the way to go.

"We took the carpet off our stairs and out of the upstairs hall, then primed and painted it. We did some sanding.

Well in the meantime you could invest in a temp gun ($15-25) to figure out what the actual temp is in the unit and check floor and neighbors walls to see if its coming from a certain area.

"I don't know about those disposable filters, but pools with sand filters have to be backwashed regularly. This involves running pool water backwards through the filter to clean the crap out, and then discharging that waste water somewhere other than the pool, usually into the yard. It is often prohibited to discharge directly into the sewer system due to the quantity of discharge, and when it's not prohibited it's often not practical due to the distance of the pool from any sewer hookup. Again, this usually leaves it going into the yard. Very common."
I live in Oakland county and itü__s always recommended around here to at least get the radon checked with a test. Also I agree about a crawl looking dry at times then getting soaked. Most of my crawl is a dust bowl year round despite the lowest part having 3 inches of standing water in the spring. I paid FSM to put in a sump and encapsulate but itü__s very pricey. So if you can do it yourself thatü__s good. If you have a low spot Iü__d recommend a crawl. Even if it never gets soaked down there if you have a pipe burst youü__ll be happy you have one. 
"My house had shag rug over vinyl when I bought it. I was worried about what they may find if they rip up the vinyl to install, as well as increased price like you mentioned. HD did the measurement and contracted out the install to their usual company. The guys that came had no issue with the vinyl since it was not cracked and very well adhered to sub floor. They installed pad and carpet right over the top. My install is guaranteed. Five months later still very happy with end result and the quality of the install. Hope this helps with your situation. "
"Ok that seems like excessively thick drywall _˘Æ_˘Æ anyway, most wallmounts allow you to mount the TV offset. So measure if you put the back plate as close to center as possible and the mounting brackets as far over towards the wall center if it will be close enough. If not get a wall mount that is adjustable side to side (usually called ""full motion"") this will allow you to move the TV over to the side of the mount completely while still getting 2 studs for the back plate.Way easier to switch inputs with a full motion mount either way _˘Æ_˘Æ_˘Æ_˘Æ"
"So, I'm thinking your ""outer"" door is what's more commonly called a storm door. (That ""bug mesh"" is usually referred to as a screen.) Storm doors typically don't have insulated glass, higher end versions might. But the glass insert is basically condensing/fogging the same way a glass of ice water does in the summer due to temperature differences between inside and out. So there's not much you can do to prevent fogging that I'm aware of. You could try to find an insulated glass insert for it, but if it's an older door that may prove difficult at best."
"Thatü__s a decent cost for something that might not happen ever, or maybe once every 5 years. I live in the rural northern Midwest. We get harsh winters here, but in the 10 years Iü__ve lived in my current small town, Iü__ve had electric go down once from a blizzard. Now I know that my experience isnü__t the same for everyone, but wouldnü__t it make sense to just add a wood stove/fireplace instead of that large expense and then also replacing your stove/WH? Unless maybe you go without power like half a month every winter it just seems impractical. "

"Well unfortunately, with new relationships between contractor and customer, it's hard to trust each other.

"Correction: no. You donü__t. You run the wire from the panel with the hot and neutral into the *switch box* and not the ceiling box. Then you run a 12/2 to the ceiling box from the switch as the hot and neutral, but the hot only has current on it when the switch is triggered. To run another outlet or a different switch/fixture off of that switch box, you need to add a third 12/2 to it. The reason electricians donü__t do that is because many single gang wall boxes are too small to have three 12/2 wires. You need at least 22 cubic inches of space, and the largest a single gang wall box will be is 22.75 cubic inches. There are a variety of ways to work around this, but where I live it was until very recently usually considered to be an ü__up sellü_ù for electricians to put a neutral in every wall box. "
"I agree with others--go to town. Pics first, then start tearing out as necessary (you may have to remove cabinets in the kitchen if water is under them). I had this happen when I found a leak on a Friday night and the insurance company couldn't come out until Tuesday (by then I had 4 walls opened up, carpet up and out, and fans going for 4 days), and my family found out when my parents/brother &amp; SIL's duplex was flooded after Sandy.Insurance has $$ for rip out and remediation and they will reimburse you for mitigation effects. Just be sure to let them know that what you are doing is based on mitigation (don't bring down an entire wall, if you rip out drywall, only take out as much as is damp or to a clear break in the drywall, for example). Best of luck. It's super stressful but you'll learn! "
"I had a similar situation. Turned out that the water line from my meter (in my alley, 30ü__ from the house) to my house was leaking .  Because the line was about 3ü__ deep it took awhile before enough water leaked to saturate the soil to the point where it became obvious. I was able to dig down to the problem area and repair the line. The other option was to replace the entire line.  I fixed the leak for about $20 but to replace the line would run around $4K.  A plumber will charge you by the hour to dig to the leak so if you own a shovel and have a rough idea of where the leak is you can start digging. Warning: as always be sure you donü__t dig into something like an electric line.  Your local utility company will usually come out and mark the location of things like electric lines, gas lines etc. "
"I'm really a fan of the gas-powered lawn mower.  I see lawn mowing as a job that I never want to have to stop in the middle of just because I ran out of battery.  Sometimes it rains a lot, and the grass gets longer than I like, and I can hear the engine working harder.  With gas, that's not a problem.  I know I can have more fuel within 2 minutes.  I have about half an acre of grass.  I fill my gas can about twice a year.  I change the oil in the mower about once a year.  String trimmer and hedge trimmer, I went 40V battery-powered Kobalt.  I really can't recommend them.  I think they're un-ergonomic and clumsy.  They operate well, and they do their jobs properly, but the tools are just not great to work with.  They are cheap though, and I really only use the hedge trimmers a few times a year, so..."
"like a lot of people in this thread, i think it could be a GFCI issue.  i had something similar. noticed my toothbrush wasn't charging one day, so i guessed it was a tripped breaker. no dice. reset the GFCI, nothing changed. that weekend, i went to use the vacuum in my detached garage, and i didn't have power. reset that gfci, and my bathroom circuit started working again.a few months later, i had the same issue, so i thought to do the same things, but i wasn't as successful. turns out the wiring between the breaker and the outside outlet on the back side of my house (that acted as a junction to the garage) was made of aluminum and corroded away. replaced the wire with new romex and it worked like a charm.tldr: maybe gfci, maybe corrosion, i've had both issues in my house causing the same symptoms"
"so he quoted no curbside replacement.... check with him to see if he agrees with a service upgrade... do you have copper into the house? if so what size is it... I have 1/2"" service b/c of an old house... I lose water pressure when another faucet is on and I literally get no water out my shower head when when 2 faucets are on plus me in the shower.

I literally can't get a bigger service as the city ""does not know the size of pipe at the street"" - friggen direct quote.

"while I appreciate the out-of-the-box thinking (and you clearly read about my situation), I'm not sure you're correct.Consider:* Something like a curtain I can put over my door, with sufficient soundproofing qualities, might cost like $10 in materials.* Good wireless headphones that sound as good as my speaker setup with good bass response and which let me dance around will cost me more.  (I don't have a good pair of headphones at the moment.)Also sharing great music with my guests is a lot harder with headphones.I really am 90% of the way there, don't even need to soundproof my door, just reduce the amount of music blaring through it by just a little :).But yeah, definitely looking for cheapest, and you did answer the question so kudos for that.

"In the US we also have three types of surge protection:* Type 1 SPD protects against incoming surges, usually at the meter. These are somewhat uncommon.* Type 2 SPD protects the main panel. They are not necessarily designed for huge surges from the utility, but they can still help with that. Clamping voltage is usually 600V or more, so they won't help sensitive electronics. These are pretty easy for an electrician or competent DIYer to install.* Type 3 SPD is the kind that plugs into the wall. These can help protect sensitive equipment, but can't handle huge surges like a nearby lightning strike.As long as everything it properly grounded, there's no issues using all three types of surge protector.The surge protector receptacles I looked up are also type 3 SPD, and they have a 600V clamping voltage which is not ideal for sensitive electronics. If you can find some that clamp at 300V that would be better.I use these:https://www.tripplite.com/spikecube-series-1-outlet-personal-surge-protector-direct-plug-in-600-joules-2-dignostic-leds~SPIKECUBE"
"Caulk is placed anywhere that there might be flex such as the base of the tile to the tub, where two walls meet in a corner, and from the wall of the shower to the window sill.Grout is placed between tiles. It is like a thin concrete. Like a paste applied with a squeegee like tool to push it between the tiles. First, clean your grout, clean the tub. Remove all soap scum, mildew, etc. You want to scrub, use vinegar and water. Bleach will only kill surface mold or the top layer, not anything under it and it will only bleach out soap scum, not remove it.Now, remove all the old caulk. All of it. The new caulk will not stick to the old. Caulk removal tools help a lot as do razor scrapers.If you have mold/mildew under that caulk, clean it with a mold/mildew killer and then let the area dry well. Fans can help here. It might take a couple days. I like to wipe the area with rubbing alcohol and let dry before reapplying caulk. You can use painter's tape to make a good, straight line if you're a messy caulker. Remove the tape before the caulk dries and smooth the edge immediately.If you have any loose grout or cracked grout, it is likely that water has gotten behind the tiles. Any remedy that you attempt, will fail in short order and more mold will grow, the caulk will fail and you'll have the same problem all over again. You can try scraping out the cracked and broken grout and regrouting, but again, if there were cracks before, water has gotten behind the tiles and whatever is under the tile (likely sheetrock) is wet too. You can't get that dry, full replacement is the only option. Edit: Once the new caulk has fully dried and if there are no cracks or missing grout between your tiles, I recommend you seal the grout with a good grout sealer. This needs reapplication per the manufacturer's instructions."
"Get a basic first aid and emergency kit. Not just the j&amp;j off the shelf, but some larger gauze, bandages, and some quick snap cold packs. Keep a gallon of water there too. Keep a flash light in places you tend to sit. If there's a power outage you'll have one nearby even if you don't have your phone.Get a small spray can of fire extinguisher to keep at the entry to your kitchen. It's just a small can that looks a lot like cans of air to clean the computer, few bucks at home Depot, but it's insurance if your pizza grease build up on the bottom of your oven catches fire. Check your smoke alarms when you move in, too.Make friends with the billing office and maintenance employees. Be kind to them, if you have the means bring them coffee or a donut if you need a favor. Those small gestures will have billing bend over backwards to help you wave late fees if you're between paychecks and will bump you to the top of the maintenance list. Set up your home to live in, not to entertain. You'll have people over less often than you think and you are the primary resident, so make it a space that works for you, not one that is uncomfortable but looks nice. If you game a lot set up some space for it. Like to read while you eat breakfast? Put your breakfast table across the living room next to the window instead of in the eat in space usually against the shared wall. Be prepared for shit neighbors. If you're on a floor with people above they might be loud. It's part of apartment living and if they're not violating complex or area bylaws there isn't anything to be done. Get a white noise machine and some good earplugs. Don't be a shit neighbor. Put your garbage in the dumpster, vacuum and do loud shit 8-8, and don't park in reserved spaces you don't pay for. If you have a dog clean up after it. If you're having a domestic argument both of you step away and take a breather. Depending on where you are your neighbors might not interact with you at all. I'm on the east coast and here it's common for most neighbors in apartments to pretty much ignore each other."

"Replace that with a 1/4 turn ball valve! The problem you are going to run into is trying to get the old valve out by unscrewing both sides in the middle of the line.

Take pictures of each room as soon as you move in.  Take pictures of any problems with the apartment and make sure to inform the landlord.

"Thanks! We've been renovating since May and are finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We completely ripped out the kitchen and finally finished it two weeks ago.

"That looks designed for commercial installs - i.e where carpet is going to be direct stick to the floor (or with double bond underlayment).

"The painting definitely helps, but that first part is even more important. Galvanizing is a process where the steel is dipped in molten zinc creating a corrosion resistant layer at the molecular level on the outside of the steel.

"The problem you risk on a 13 year old water heater is that when you try to pull out that valve, the metal is corroded so badly inside that the tank tears around that valve.You've got a 50/50 chance of pulling this off.

"We painted our kitchen walls and cabinets a different colour. With regard to the cabinets, it was approx. $3500 CAD. Weü__re also located in Toronto.

Well ultimately it's your place to decide what's acceptable or not. I'd say its passable and I'm reasonably picky. I would say perhaps cut them some slack at the wall in the top of the picture. The slope on the floor to create proper drainage is likely the major cause of that perceived misalignment. 
"Whatü__s the insulation in your house like? Are the windows and doors old too? Sometimes a draft is impossible to feel but significant enough to suck your heat outside.

"As far as plans go, Iü__m not sure but google can probably help. I tend to wing it when Iü__m building things. Kind of just clicks in my head. But itü__s Definitely worth it. B.O.M. is somewhere around 14 sheets of OSB(siding plywood or whatever)  40 2X4s 8ft long, and then whatever you want to use as the roof, a door and all the hardware. That rough estimate will make an 8ü__X8ü__ shed.Min price Wood alone will be 350usd.

"Do you plan on using the counters as cutting boards?  If so then a full top coat may not be advised.  Once it is cut through the chance of moisture seeping underneath and clouding increases.For me personally I find that fully top coated butcher block counters seem synthetic and unnatural.  Oiled or oil/waxed looks great, natural, and really isnü__t that big of a deal to upkeep.  Once it has the initial saturation coat a once a year or so deep clean/dry/recoat isnü__t that big of a deal.  All depending on your usage and cleaning techniques of course."
"For my kitchen I went with laminate. You cannot beat the prices. They sell prefab ones in various sizes that have a backsplash or if you don't like those choices you can build the countertop with plywood, building it up around the edges and at the seems. then apply a big sheet of laminate and cut it down with a router and using a good file to get it perfect after that. I painted my oak cabinets I like it much more than the oak look. https://imgur.com/aPvc4Hk picture of my kitchen with laminate and painted oak cabinets, before i got the backsplash on. "
"Honestly just painting both of the quarter round and original baseboard white will help a ton. If you're really not wanting to spend much/any money, then using a chisel (or sandpaper) and some caulk or joint compound to take down those ridges and fill in the holes will help as well. Otherwise, new baseboards are cheap and you would be surprised at how they will transform a room.Also, God bless the flooring installer that was too lazy to just take original baseboards off before installing the floor, and instead just slapped quarter round over it..."
"How much do you actually know about the technology that is gaining more attention and market demand in the U.S. residential market?I am contractor and my customers are requesting the most-efficient technology available that will allow them to save on utility bills.

"I agree that you should have one line going in and run everything internally. Unfortunately, that's not what was done. I assumed it was due to the construction of the walls, or because it was easier. There is a dish mounted to one corner between first and second floors, which goes to a splitter mounted outside next to it, which feeds four coax lines going to three bedrooms and the living room.Then there is an ethernet line coming from an AT&amp;T box outside the house, which is run under the eves and drops down to the living room and two bedrooms."
"I doubt you are getting too much heat from those copper pipes but surely there is some. Based on some quick googling it looks like bare 1/2"" copper pipe gives up about 30 BTUs/hr/ft. So even at 50 ft you are looking at only 1500 BTU/hr (and obviously only while the heat is actually running). My guess is most of the heat comes from the furnace and some from the hot water heater.If you have easy access to the pipes and want to get some foam insulation, by all means. It will only cost a few dollars and might help a bit. But I wouldn't obsess over it."
"I had this opinion, then bought a house with a pool 2 years ago..* I have 3 kids now and they love it.* I love being able to swim any time.* Wife loves floating and tanning for the most part.* It's great if you like entertaining (parties).* It's really relaxing after work or in the evening.Sure you need to clean and maintain the pool but it's not that bad. &lt;30 min of work per week and a few hundred dollars in electricity and supplies for the summer.Yes buying replacement parts will suck but there seems to be a ton of used parts on kijiji."

"I'll remember that. I have a crazy silly thing I want to try with a spare bag of Structolite plaster to even out another area of floor in my house as a sort of homemade silly gypcrete kind of thing. I have a bunch of spare liquid waterproofer as well. Main thing I noticed trying the liquid waterproofer on Structolite is the porosity is really high, it had no bond issues at all and stuck perfect (it was Mapei Aquadefense, btw...) but it just dried within 30 seconds of putting it on with a brush, whereas with cement board it didn't dry nearly as quick.

"Not sure of the burglary rate where you live, but remember that the harder it is for a burglar to get in the harder it will be for emergency services to get in too.

"The good thing is that a pool is usually considered a negative in real estate so you should be able to get a discount or make an offer based on the fact that you will have to either fix the pool or fill it in. I think it would be cool to get it working again. A new cement pool can cost 50 to 100k from what I've read. The downside according to my husband who grew up with a pool is that it needs constant maintenance, regular upkeep and you have to replace things like liners and pumps every few years. Might be worth it to dive into your own pool though. "
"There is always the possibility that grit will get stuck between the magnet and the refrigerator.

"Very nice! I just bought a house with very dark wood cabinets in a (small-ish) galley kitchen, and combined with dark yellow walls and bad lighting the kitchen felt like a cave. My cabinets aren't in as good a shape as yours, so I plan to replace them in about 5 years but I knew I couldn't live with them so dark for so long. Since I was having the rest of the interior painted anyway, I had my painters include the cabinets in their quote. Mine aren't quite as spectacular as yours, but the change to white with light walls feels like a whole new kitchen!"
"We went from a Honeywell smart thermostat (so we could control it from our phones) to a Nest and the Nest is in many ways better. The number one way it is better is how it controls the fan (it keeps blowing for 15 minutes after the heater/AC shut off which helps it be more efficient without as much energy). Also the way it can tell when we are out of the house so we donü__t have to remember to turn it up/down...If you do decide to go for it, check your electricity provider to make sure they donü__t have any rebates, we saved quite a bit on our Nest!"
"Looks cool, but the walls of my attic are slanted so a) that'd be a pain in the arse to install for me (I'm assuming) and b) they cost a crap ton!

Are there any notable differences between air coolers and (portable) A/C units? And would they work in cooling the room? I'm really quite clueless in this area and have little experience..."
"Yeah i'll be getting a hygrometer here soon to get a better reading on it. I primarily only really notice the dryness when i'm laying in bed- the bottom/floor corners of the wall which the head of the bed is up against have gaps between the trim, which actually enter the wall voids. I wonder if excessively dry and dusty air could be leaking in through those? I was thinking about foam sealing them until we can replace the trim. the house is pretty old and i'm sure we have air leakage around the windows as well, so I'll try the film as well. We run a big box fan and humidifier at night, so the air circulates pretty well. My significant other has the same problem with the dryness so I feel like it's not just me, and i'm not unusually thirsty during the day, it's pretty much only when i'm laying in bed. "
"You have the right cleaners.  Note that you donü__t want to flood the laminate with water or your seams may become more visible.  When I did wood floors, we would recommend Bona cleaners, and the mop was one with a microfiber head (think of it as a reusable stiffer head).  The cleaner was dispensed from a spray bottle that shot a stream.  Since them, Iü__ve used the same cleaner on the laminate in my kitchen with good results.  Zep is much the same.  Also note the ratio of cleaner to water.  Too much will leave a residue and haze, so more is not better.  If you have stuff you need to get off, do spot cleaning first.  Before these cleaners hit the market, we would recommend a cup of white vinegar to two gallons of warm water.  That is what I used when my kids were crawling around on our floors too. "
"After removing the old glass, use a stiff putty knife or wood chisel to scrape the frame clean of any remaining old putty, then sand it down to fresh wood with a medium grit. Prime the wood where the putty goes, an often forgotten step.Now measure for the replacement glass. First use a square, such as an accurate framing square or speed square, to check the sash for squareness. If it's bad, consider removing the sash and taking it to a glass store or hardware store, and having them fix it there. Not a bad idea in any case.If the sash is square, and you want to install new glass in place, measure the opening, then have the glass cut 1/8"" to 3/16"" smaller than the opening.If installing it yourself, don't forget to lay down a bedding layer of putty under the glass before placing the glass in the sash. Add the metal glazier points, two or three to a side, then final putty over top the points. Knead the putty into ""rope"" before laying down. Don't try to spread the putty like peanut butter; it needs to be pressed down hard and the excess squeezed out."
"Yeah, a lot of this does depend on location, so the best insight I can give is how it works where I live (SE Michigan). Pulling a building permit does add to the taxable value of your home here, so it will translate to an increase in property taxes based on the cost of the project and how much value it adds to the home. So a lot of people kind of try to avoid pulling permits. Technically speaking, permits are required for any changes to rough electrical, rough plumbing, any structural changes, and for certain larger projects like a new roof or pouring a new concrete driveway. Those bigger roofing and concrete jobs are not very typically done by the homeowner, so permits are almost always pulled. For everything inside the home though, it is pretty common for DYIers not to pull permits, and there is very little repercussion for not doing so. The local building department could issue a stop work order if they catch you doing any unpermitted work, but unless they are literally looking in your windows how are they going to catch you. Some cities are a little more strict and it might raise a red flag if they see construction debris at your curb on trash day, but that is kind of the exception and not the norm. So you take a small risk of getting caught in the act, but honestly you have a better chance of being hit by a bus. When you sell the home, your typical real estate sale is done on an ü__as isü_ù basis. If a potential buyer sees that a lot of work has been done, they absolutely can do their homework to see whether or not any permits were pulled. If they discover there were no permits, really the worst that can happen is they decide not to buy the home and they walk away. If they do buy the property, the transaction is final and once everyone signs all the closing paperwork, any issues with the home are now the new ownerü__s problem. So, YMMV but around here itü__s relatively common not to pull permits and nothing bad happens. Regardless, always take pride in your work, do it right, and donü__t attempt it if you donü__t know what youü__re doing.

I had a similar issue happen with my toilet in the basement of my house.  I opened it up to no peer one morning and a goddamn rat jumped out at me.

Pets should be more sensible.Also, don't overfill the thing.  That can cause problems.  "
"Agreed with the recessed lighting. Essentially they are 4-6"" holes cut into your attic that's not climate controlled. But  if you do want to insulate them, you need to make sure you replace the bulbs with something rated for being insulated. Not just any LED bulb will do, there are some specific retrofit kits for $5-10 a bulb that will let you insulate and seal the recessed cans.I did retrofit about six of them in my house and it cost maybe $50 and made those areas nicer and less dusty. Swapped out the bulbs, different rims, and sealed with caulking."

"Placement is standard now. One story, with an attic above, I would definitely check the insulation up there to see if the requisite (R38) amount up there.Most likely though, it seems like there is too little cold air out the vent.

"If you are someone who enjoys swimming and would like and use a pool I would seriously consider getting the pool back in working order. Even if it is moderately expensive, it's a unique opportunity to get a pool for what would probably be a small fraction of having one installed from scratch.I would personally never deck over a pool for two main reasons:1) Decking over the expanse of a pool represents a number of challenges and risks in how the deck is supported with a pool underneath. What is the condition of the earth under the pool? What is the deck anchored into? What does code state must be done?2) Having the large void of a pool under a decked structure would invite a lot of nasty problems that would be difficult to remediate.

"Just posted this on another thread.&gt;Silicone doesn't work like caulk, you don't smear it in with your finger at all. When you cut the nozzle do it angled, and when pumping it should be angled in such a way that it's pushing in and binding on either side of the gap. Then spray the silicone, and your popsicle stick (buy new from craft store so it's not contaminated) with suds. Use popsicle stick to contour it in such a way that pleases you. Don't try to go too thin of a bead (as in barely just covering the gap), the silicone still needs to be able to bind either side. If you feel the need to use your finger (totally unnecessary!), use a rubber glove (bacteria/oils from finger even with suds on it will get into the silicone and cause it to degrade prematurely) and spray that with suds before doing so."

"There is a good middle ground here, which is to get a second or third opinion. No way I would spend even a thousand dollars on something like this without having someone else take a look at it.

"Its probably helpful to diagram out the area of the proposed deck and your joist pleacement/cement blocks.  I think you Should be going for 18"" on center deck joists using ground contact rated joist boards. The landscaping fabric you described may be helpful to prevent weeds from growing up through which would be pretty ugly, but might need a little bit of gravel to keep it settled. As you build it all. How big (width x length) is the deck going to be?  That could help inform how many cement posts/rests are needed. Having too many cross sections between your deck joists can add on a lot of weight and can make ventilation and air flow an issue, so I would only do extras when necessary. Depending on what your building the deck out of you will want to make sure there's enough airflow under your deck joists for ventilation. If there isn't enough ventilation it could invalidate the warranty for the deck boards. There are a few YouTube tutorials on how to designate and build a nearly ground level deck that I found really helpful when building mine. "
"We're doing similar updates in our home. Air sealing and blown in fiber is on the right track. We're also considering the DIY route, and while the general work is pretty nuts n bolts, you need to consider other things than just blowing it in. Does your budget cover the machine? Typically it's included if you buy X amount from a big box store. Does your DIY route include baffles for eves etc. Are you eyeing up the basic foam cans or the pro kit? When sealing a whole attic it makes a big difference. When we're crunching the numbers, the pro cost vs time and energy we would spend to do it our selves is minimal IMO.

"The water's not going to condense for no reason, condensation happens because humid air is cooled to its dew point. If you have a wall with cold air on one side and warm air on the other, the temperature through that wall is a gradient from one to the other, hot to cold. How quickly that gradient changes depends on the materials in the wall assembly. At some point that gradient is equal to the dew point, so that's where you get condensation in the wall. The vapor barrier goes on the warm side of the insulation because warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so condensation happens when warm air is cooled and not the other way around.If you have an effective vapor barrier, it will prevent moist air from moving through the wall assembly to the point where the temperature equals the dew point and therefore prevent condensation in the wall. So, for point #2, interior drywall is going to be very close to the same temperature as the air inside the room so as long as you don't have un-checked humidity inside, you're not really risking condensation where the drywall meets the vapor barrier.To point #1, theoretically, all of those little holes do negatively impact the effectiveness of the vapor barrier, but it's still much better than no vapor barrier at all. The hole in the vapor barrier is plugged by the fastener and the hole is sandwiched between the drywall and the stud. I'd be more concerned about a tear in the vapor barrier between the studs (like one created when you hang a picture) but those kinds of tears are few and far between.There is an interesting debate about how well-sealed we want our buildings to be. Basically you don't want any of the materials inside the wall to get wet and stay wet (the paper of on drywall can support mold growth, wood decays, insulation loses its ability to insulate, etc.) so if it does get wet you want it to be able to dry. So if your building is almost perfectly sealed but water still finds its way in somewhere, how is it going to dry out? On the flip side, too much permeability  means materials can get wet more easily and the increased air flow diminishes the effectiveness of the insulation (unless, of course, it's an impermeable insulation like rigid foam board, which brings us back to the first scenario). What's the right amount of ""breathing"" for a building?"
"So, so many in my old house.It was my grandparents house which they were the first owners of.  When my grandmother passed, I bought it from my dad.There are so many things in it that I'd refered to being ""grandfathered in"".  Not in the sense that they were allowable under old code -- no, many of these things were shitty mickey-mouse jobs that my grandfather did.My particular favorite was his [anti-gravity laundry drain](https://imgur.com/AwUS0iQ).  What you are seeing here is two parts of an amazing whole.  One, is the washer drain itself.  You see it peaking out through the supply hoses.  That goes up a slight incline to tie into the back of the sink drain, above the p-trap.  It then goes down and around to come back up again to go into a drain that ties into sewer.  How it leaked so little is beyond me, but it certainly backed up on every drain cycle.  I ended up fixing this by running a straight pipe out from the drain up to the wall, then going straight up where it branched off to three lines.  One to the left to catch the sink (and replaced that godawful corroded P-trap and all the under-sink plumbing), one to the right to form a standpipe, and one straight up for a cheater valve.My other favorites, for which I have no pictures:  - Plugs with ground screw bonded to neutral via 20AWG speaker wire.  These managed to fool my inspector. - Electrified drop ceiling grid.  That was a fun one to find out about. - Utility sink in the basement (not this one, another one) where he had plumbed the hot on the right and the cold on the left.  For some reason, he decided the best way to fix this would be to install the faucet backwards?  When I sold the house, the buyers inspector tried to turn it on.  My agent told him not to as the sink hadn't run in a long time and probably doesn't work.  Well, he did anyway.  Since the faucet was installed backwards, he put down about 3-too-many unga-bungas trying to turn it on, but in essence actually tightened the valve more, ultimately making the sink impossible to turn off.  To add insult to injury, we also found out that day that the drain leaked a significant amount as well.  - There was a light above that backwards utility sink.  It was one of those basic porcelin lamp bases, nothing fancy.  Really, nothing fancy.  It was mounted to a sheet of pine that spanned the joists, without a box.  Sticking out of the lamp was a lamp cord, just barely long enough for it to plug in to a receptacle mounted on another joist.  When I say ""just barely long enough"", I mean that if the basement were just slightly more drafty it would have blown the plug right out of the socket.  This 3-prong receptacle was then wired via ungrounded romex, secured by the trusty old 'black-tape-and-clothesline-to-the-bathtub-drain' method.  Fortunately, it was in a box, and fed into a j-box which then went to the upside-down light switch that controlled it.  At no point in this was a single box-clamp used.  He had a deep-seated objection to those, which was part of the problem that caused the electrified drop-ceiling.   - The basement stairs had a light that was controlled by a door switch.  When I say ""door switch"" I mean a door switch which I believe he probably found at a junk-yard out of a 1970 Hornet or some shit.  Wired up with more of the 20AWG speaker wire, run along the wall and spliced, outside of a box, with just black tape.   - Oh yeah, the subpanel.  There was a subpanel for a 220V branch that he installed for a space heater that he found on the side of the road and immediately stopped using after the first electric bill.  No fuse tying it into the panel (yes, the house had fuses), nope -- and I use the term ""subpanel"" quite loosely as it was actually a fused on-off switch.  And it didn't use screw in fuses, no no no, it used cartridge fuses.  And not inside of a holder, like ranges and dryers used to use in the day -- nope, if you needed to get these fuses out, you'd be doing it with your bare hands.  I had my electrician rip that out when he upgraded me to breakers.  I wouldn't touch that fucking thing with a 10-foot fiberglass rod."

Agreed. It almost certainly came from the main sewer your service connects to. The only way I can think of to prevent sewer critters from making it to the toilet is expensive. Install a sewage ejector pit and pump and route the toilet to this. Then it would run into a pump before it got to the toilet. 
"An expansion tank has been installed on the cold water side since we moved in. No recent work other than removing the yard sprinklers for winter. No city work nearby either. There is a check valve installed, but its been there since we moved in and its after the pressure reducing valve (set at 50PSI). "
"An intermediate step, you can hang little stained glass frames from etsy or some craft fair that you find in the window on wire. A lot of people in homes like mine will do that in the living room window or other area that lacks a stained glass. It's a little more ""real"" than a stick'em. Just a thought."
"Angle grinder set up for floor grinding is the fastest way. Don't go for an aggressive blade, take your time and be gentle so you don't strip too much back.Also, might pay to check that the floor has enough left on it that it won't split at the tongue and groove after sanding it back this time round."
"Any plumbing supply or real hardware store should have any size o-ring, square-ring, or flat-ring that you need.  If not, cut some from larger washers or from sheet rubber.  It's actually rather easy to make custom washers with a razor, X-Acto knife, and a file -- rubber is easy to shape with a file.  "
"Any water damaged drywall, insulation and plywood needs to be removed.  Start there.

"Aside from the ü__tent-garageü_ù you likely need a permit to do anything....I used a tent garage for a while, I built a 3/4ü_ù plywood floor for it, and used a propane heater in the winter and it was ok.

"Aside from way too much putty that nut is not even close to tight enough, it'll need another 3 or more full turns. It feels like it's tight because you are supposed to have a smooth washer (sometimes made of paper) between the nut and the rubber gasket. If you don't have that you get too much friction."
"C'mon, post them! The ""after"" shot looks great, so don't worry about negative comments. Plus, for those of us who are planning on doing something similar, you might provide some good ideas.I'm in the final steps of completing my garage and looking for additional methods for storage and organization."
"Could it be the old insulation? I mean 5 years is a long time...

"Depends on the value of the home, its age, and the value of the homes in the neighborhood. If your house is undervalued and everyone else has modern kitchens, go for it.If not, youü__ll want to put some thought into how much you want to spend that you might not get back when you go to sell the house."
Ditto. Just take a utility knife and cut the caulk as best as you can. Slip a putty knife or something else thin in between the wall and panel and pry it off. You can then either remove any excess caulk with a sharp chisel or when you replace the panel use caulk again to seal it/hide any imperfections.
"Framers use them all the time. Why wouldnü__t you? Much faster than a circular saw. Edit: For downvoters...if you have to cut a bunch of studs (like over and under window frames for instance) are you gonna measure and cut each one or are you gonna take 3 seconds and set-up a stop on a radial arm saw?"
"Ha ! Years ago I had some small peckers wake me up at the crack every morning .

"I agree with the others.  Sounds like the court is going to have to get involved.  I'd also ask your neighbor if they'd be willing to get a independent surveyor and go halves with you.  If they decline (which sounds likely) then get another one anyway have them do it again, and then take both to court."
"I personally installed acrylic coated fiberglass tubs and surrounds in my last 2 bathroom remodels.  They are strong, lightweight, and easy to clean.  That the wife and I could carry and maneuver them ourselves made then ideal for getting in thru the narrow doors and 90 degree turns that the house has."
"I'm not sure what caulk he used, but the tub is acrylic and the gap isn't very big, i'd say no more than 4 millimeters. I assume the surfaces were clean and dry when he did it.  He's been a contractor for over 30 years and did my buddy's bathrooms (he recommended this guy to me) without any problems.  "
"I've paid this kind of fee. I think it's a good sign that this contractor isn't just giving out half-ass estimates and seeing what sticks. Plus I've had a contractors simply ghost me after a ""free estimate"" visit. If I paid them for it, I'd feel justified demanding a detailed estimate. Also, $69? Nice."
"If you don't have soft close cabinets, just don't slam it closed if it's loud. Try keeping your stuff somewhere besides a cabinet.  I find it incredible that eating cereal wakes up your roommate. Either they are an incredibly light sleeper or you are a loud breakfaster.  Time to silence your dish ware."
"In the kitchen, and possibly your workshop/garage, add a 20 Amp outlet or two. Some fancy prosumer kitchen appliances and power tools require it.Source: I borrowed a $3K espresso machine for staging/broker's open on my last house. It was quite a hit with the foodies. 15 Amp wouldn't have handled it. "
It's definitely the mixer valve. Tankless water heaters are at much lower temperatures than tanked heaters. Pull the knob off of your shower and there should be a disk with an arrow that controls the mix between the hot and cold side. Adjust it so that full hot is a comfortable shower/bath temperature

"Looks great, thanks for sharing.That ladder picture tho...gave me a mini-heart attack at my desk.Also, awesome job on the flooring. I like that you stripped it all (including asbestos tile) and started fresh. I know you can just cover it up, but there's something to be said for making it ""perfect""."
"My guess is shitty mud job since you can see the tape popping.  Probably a combination of poor product and workmanship along with skimping on enough mud to cover the joints (for instance, maybe they only skimmed 2x instead of 3).  I'm not a pro, so you should probably get one over to look things over. "
"So you are using a liner WITH RedGard on top of the mudbed?&gt;And if you go with any irregular shaped tile, you can't use that awesome pre-mixed epoxy grout.There is no such thing as ""premix epoxy grout"". You might mean regular premix grout (which is complete garbage) or a premix urathane grout. "
"Thanks I appreciate it! It is in the center of the home, but it doesn't follow on up to the second story, nor do I see any footings following that path in the basement.

"Thanks for the info. Knowing that it's not really feasible to run a new line to the fan, is what I'm thinking the next best thing? The fan does have a wireless transmitter and remote. Is there another way to control fan and lights separately that are wired on the same switch besides what I am thinking?"
"Thanks for the response. I can assure you that there is significant rot in the OSB, it's falling apart in areas.

"Thanks for the tip, didn't think that would be an issue with hardwired ones. Will do that asap. I hope you're right. With our model I've read interference from remote controls, light switches and even antennas can cause the issue. Really hope a quick vacuum and replacement of batteries does the trick. "
"The foam stuff is meant to be permanent.  It's possible to use a sharp blade to remove or trim it, but it's best for between the jamb and studs, not between the door and the jamb.

The previous owners passed away within a month of each other to my knowledge not in the home.

"Well thatü__s definitely good to know. We really havenü__t had much of a problem with that, at least as far as I can tell.

"Well, I'm pretty embarrassed to say I didn't just notice it. We've been in this house for 3 years and knew about it then but just now getting to it. So I think it should survive the winter and I'll do some research during that time and hopefully I'll be able to get it knocked out. Thanks for the input!"
"When I framed in my door in the master of my brick home, I used a steel lintel to carry the load, then bricked around it.  You cannot tell the steel is there.  I was thinking that you could do something like that, then veneer around the opening to fool the eye into believing that it was all 100% brick."
"Yeah OP, from looking at the pic and reading what you want to do with the kitchen, you would be better off just taking the backsplash out and put something else in. That tile being large and on a diagonal is going to limit you on what you can change easily.  Much easier to change it out now that later."
You don't have to put any of your posts in concrete. Just doing the corners wont help at all.

"I don't know about everyone else, but my smart thermostat just drops the heat to 60 if no one is home, it doesn't shut it off completely.Though, 65 is unnecessarily warm for a vacant house.  The biggest issue is that your basement needs to stay above about 50 degrees, so you need to know what the typical temperature difference is.  If your basement runs 5 degrees cooler than the rest of the house, you should keep the thermostat at no colder than 55.*This advice is based upon working for a municipal water service, Meter Repair division, in Michigan.*"

"Lithofin's Builders Clean or Intensive Cleaner (cleans up just about anything I've tried it on) are both options I've used in past that have been very, very effective. They also have ""Power clean"" and ""Ceramic cleaner"" alternative options.

"Ridge Carbide is supposed to be equally as good as Forrest, but also equally expensive.Tenryu also makes good blades.Also consider the frued industrial line. Also red, but maybe a little better than Diablo. I just put a premier fusion blade on my table saw, and it's pretty cool how nice of a finish it leaves. And I'm happy with their thin kerf ripping blade, which was one of the cheapest flat tooth blades I could find.  It remains to be seen how long they hold up. I bought the saw used, and the Diablo blade the previous owner left on it was trashed."
"Some short pieces (6-12 inches) that have the cut on them for each type of cut you would need to make...  left inside corner, left outside corner, right inside corner, right outside corner.  Write which piece they are and any details about how the trim needs to be positioned on the saw such as the face that is out and the side that is up on the saw.When you're ready to make a left inside cut you use that 'cheater' piece to verify your markings and placement before doing your cut.    Makes it much easier to do your sanity checks and not ruin good trim."
Tenants are usually charged on move out after a manager inspects the apt. Simple fixes like this are usually not charged for. At least in my area. I've done probably 100 fixes like this when I worked for a management company and only a few got charged. One I remember specifically because a tenant attempted to fix it and turned a 20 minute fix into an hour. If the property doesn't allow animals but it was done by a 'therapy dog' then they'll get nailed for sure. Granted I'm in Mass.  where it's almost impossible to hold a tenant accountable for anything.
"We are debating the same issue. We ripped out a deck that was the same level as the door and had steps going off the side onto a sidewalk. We had thought we would just put in a patio and have the steps come straight off of the door, but the steps are actually going to take up part of the patio area now, leaving less room for a table and chairs. It also means we have to figure out where to out a rail (or not have one at all), so we decided to just stick with the same thing we had before. We will have to build the patio up a couple of feet but that is ok!"
"You should replace it. If it's making noise, even if it's working, its not working as well as it should. Maybe record a clip so we can hear? I have a fair bit of experience listening to the difference between a fan not spinning at all and one that just needs oil. But even if it just needs oil I'd replace it. A lot of old fans don't pull much air and the new ones are really nice. I am renovating a place and I got a bluetooth one with a really nice bright LED light. You don't need something that fancy but there are many options with nice CFM, lights, etc."
"it really depends on the codes in the area.  If OP put in a non-code compliant repair, and it failed causing damage to his house, his insurance would most definitely not cover any damage if they found it OP did the faulty repair.  I used to sell insurance.  One of our big points to get across to customers is that if you do any work, make sure it is professionally acceptable, or don't say anything at all, because if you have an electrical fire and you claim you rewired the house, insurance won't cover it unless you pulled a permit and had it inspected.  "
"Are you using a real estate agent? If so, have them do a walk through and give you some tips.Generally, clear out the clutter everywhere to make things look more spacious and less personalized then put it in storage. This includes the garage and excess furniture.  Pack away all the personal things like pictures and kids creations. Neutral paint, bed coverings, towels, etc. Lighting is important too. Remove outdated window coverings. Make it light and airy. Consider changing out lightbulbs to maximize lighting. Make sure each switch works.I would not use air fresheners they can be pretty off putting to people. Rather ozone treat the house or bake bread/cookies. New welcome mat, fresh plants outside.

"Instead of replacing your windows, try your hand at reglazing them, foaming gaps, and install new vinyl storm windows. You will save a lot of money and probably realize better energy savings than you would having someone put in new windows.  The originals are very rare these days and add so much character to a home.  Another thing people tend not to realize is that the replacements will be smaller and let in less light.If you do decide to replace them, PLEASE locate an architectural salvage shop or habitat for humanity restore rather than tossing them out.Also, realize that windows are going to be a relatively low return on investment from an efficiency standpoint, youü__d be *much* better served air sealing and insulating your attic and rim joists which will e less costly and easy to do on your own."

"You know you're providing a check list of what not to do ae?Stiff mix (adhesive doesn't bond well), spot glue (lack of coverage and support on the tiles).It's fastest to trowel the wall, back butter tiles, clean excess and then stick them up spacing as you go. I usually do around 14 ft at a time.it's damn messy and I get a bit of shit for it, but dropsheets and protection card always gets installed prior to starting, at my expense. Keep trowel lines the same way, let's air out as you install the tiles and allows for greater coverage and easier time getting them flat. Levelling systems also make it easier but gotta be careful to get the adhesive spread even prior, or end up with inadequate coverage (tcna calls for 85% coverage) Gotta get the base rows in (no ledger boards here) and cut those level.

"Bathroom grade silicone.Silicone &gt; caulk in this type of application.Posted this in another thread a while back so will copypasta it here.&gt;Silicone doesn't work like caulk, you don't smear it in with your finger at all. When you cut the nozzle do it angled, and when pumping it should be angled in such a way that it's pushing in and binding on either side of the gap. Then spray the silicone, and your popsicle stick (buy new from craft store so it's not contaminated) with suds. Use popsicle stick to contour it in such a way that pleases you. Don't try to go too thin of a bead (as in barely just covering the gap), the silicone still needs to be able to bind either side. If you feel the need to use your finger (totally unnecessary!), use a rubber glove (bacteria/oils from finger even with suds on it will get into the silicone and cause it to degrade prematurely) and spray that with suds before doing so.suds = dishwash liquid that is NOT antibacterial.Also, you need to thoroughly remove existing prior to use of silicone or it may not bond well."

It's right next to the utility room and there's a lot of extra space to work with. Ikea is a few hours away from us but I have seen some sinks there that I like.

"When I see these homes updated, I don't blame the owner. Frequently the reason the reno was needed was because the state of the place was beyond neglected (a house the same style of mine was foreclosed in a truly pitiful state and they did some serious updating, no salvaging floors after ignoring a roof for 2 years...)  And if you have to sell ""uncle ralphs tobacco stianed old house"" I can totally sympathize updating on a budget to modern stuff. That said, I saw some truly bizarre things done to old houses in MKE while looking for a place to live. ""open floor plan"" that actually meant demolishing bedrooms and turning the floor plan into bizarre and claustrophobic chapes, slate countertops and gray tile motifs straight out of a 2010 ""hip"" apartment.  Some houses had these renovations that were older than me of dubious construction. A basement that had been excavated out to street level and made into a 1 car garage, but the stair case had to be moved so it's now so steep you have to go down it like a ladder or limbo. I'm 6' and the really old houses, you have to duck sometimes on the stairs, this stair case floor level hit me at about the mid-chest... wtf? My real estate agent had a similar appreciation for old homes and he and I had an understanding and noped out of more than a couple goofy ass houses. "
"I feel like all I have is weeds! No idea what was there. She closed on the house the day of our first date and it took me a while to move in and shack up with her. Before me she had lawn people that did seeding, aerating, etc. During my tenure all I've ever put down is Kentucky Bluegrass or variants of Kentucky Bluegrass. In a former life I worked at a ski area and pieced together seasonal jobs so golf course maintenance (mowing, maintenance and drainage) was one of those jobs. I know way too much about grass and drainage. I feel like Kentucky Bluegrass is appropriate for our soil, climate and also for my/our feed/water/fertilize schedules --but open to suggestions! Home is unobstructed south facing. During the summer months we have early (direct) sun and afternoon shade on front lawn. Back yard is opposite --early shade (and cool) then afternoon direct and hot/dry, until sunset. I water the front lawn (sprinklers on Raspberry Pi controller) at dawn and then back yard usually 3 hours after sunrise. (depending on other factors like soil moisture content, ambient air humidity, temperature, etc.) I put lime (negative pH) into the back yard sprinkler watering loop because we adopted this (cute) four-legged asshole (with fur and a tail) who kills everything she pisses on. So the lime helps to counteract the acidity of their pee (her, the other one doesn't kill what she pisses on).... we have eight paws and two tails.I obsess (probably too much) over the grass... But it looks nice :) Feed it properly and you'll have a monster on your hands. edit: typo"

"Oil and gas are just incredibly efficient ways of generating heat. A gallons of heating oil costs about $2.80 right now and you get about 120,000 BTUs of usable heat out of it. To get that same amount of heat from electricity would use about 35 kWh and cost $6 or so.So it's $2.80 vs $6.00 for the same amount of heat. And [according to this website](https://carbonfund.org/how-we-calculate/) electricity production produces an average of 1.22 lbs of CO2 per kWh which means that electric heat actually produces more CO2 (heating oil is 22.4 lbs per gallon)."

Theyü__re relatively accessible at Target or Best Buy and I have a standing subscription for replacement filters from Amazon every 3 months. Also a friendly reminder that if you have a ton of dust, make sure that your household filter for the furnace is replaced regularly. And washing your bedding if your dog is around!"
"The thing with crawlspace vents is that sometimes they are placed there for a good reason.  If you're in NW Missouri the Radon map shows high levels of radon.  If you seal the vents the radon won't be able to escape your crawlspace.  Depending on how your HVAC and hood vent system are setup your house may be depressurized at certain times which means the house will be pulling air from the crawlspace into the house, like if you turn on the range hood but don't have a dedicated supply air vent.  You don't want to be sucking radon into your house, trust me."
"This ^ we have 1.6 gallons per flush toilets at my work and they couldnü__t flush a piece of toilet paper without flushing 2-3 times. The measurements of how much solid waste the toilet can evacuate is the better rating to look at.

I would put gpf towards the bottom of the list. And go for the lowest you can to save water, but high enough for average use. "
"Well, I don't know about ""highway grade"", but I know that $2.80/sf is a pretty good price.  Around here (Michigan) it's close to 3.75/sf.  Just make sure you get assurances as to the thickness of the asphalt and what kind of prep work they are going to do.  Asphalt on dirt isn't going to last, you'll need a crushed rock base to put it on.  Will that be up to you?  Or is there already a gravel drive that he's going to pave over? If he's just going to pave what's already there, you'd best know how thick the gravel is and add to it if it's not thick enough."
"&gt;we initially listed it at $100/sq ft which was in line with the neighborhood comps...  I personally think that the size of our house maybe another factor since everything in the neighborhood is about 2000 sq.ft &amp; sold at $200K but our house lists higher compared to the neighborhood. Not all square footage is equally valuable. All those other houses have kitchens and bathrooms and a few bedrooms, etc. The 400 sq ft extra that your house has is not worth the same.Honestly it sounds like you need to lower the price more. It is very very unlikely that any renovation project will increase the sales price of the house beyond what that market price is now enough to pay itself off.It's very easy for the realtor to recommend that you spend your money to make him get his commission faster (or higher)."
"I know everyone is saying that they're great for compatibility and they probably are, but I had a Lutron CL dimmer and I don't know if it was defective but I couldn't find any LED bulbs that would dim with it and I tried several different brands.I went with Leviton LED dimmers instead, and the smoothest dimming LEDs I have found, at least with those, are the Hyperikon bulbs on Amazon. Make sure they're actually the dimmable model of course, but they're great. They dim all the way to zero, and they do it smoothly and consistently with no flickering. I've been very happy with them. I did have one that started to flicker a bit after a few weeks of use, but I think it was just defective too.Anyway that's been my experience. It's a bit annoying that the whole dimming process is such a crapshoot. Good luck!"
"Just like most common building materials, stucco can either be problem free for decades, or fall apart in a few years, depending on whether it was done properly or not. There's absolutely nothing about stucco that *inherently* causes mold. Done correctly, it's an extremely durable exterior finish that can last with little maintenance for an extremely long time. It's kind of like having a sidewalk on the side of your house. Your SO is probably thinking of the product EIFS, which is this fake stucco bullshit that was popular for a bit, and turned out to be a complete fucking disaster. If there's nothing that seems wrong about your stucco (discoloration, signs of mold or rot from the interior of your house), then it's probably fine! It's not an easy finish to patch neatly, though. Can you vent out your roof?"

"Thanks for your insight, now you have me leaning towards nails, haha. Posts are PT, Stringers are also PT for ground contact. Pickets are 1x6x6 dog eared sunwood that have been dipped. Based on what you have suggested, I am now considering using 8d 1.5in galvanized nails to attach brackets to posts, and then the same nails (maybe go screws here since the head doesn't need to be flush) to attached 2x4s to brackets. Does that seem reasonable? Also, since you obviously have some sway in the dynamism of how I'm approaching this project, I'd love to hear your suggestion on how best to attach the 1x6x6ft pickets at the three stringers. Nails, staples, screws, I'd love to not have to buy or rent a compressor and gun, but if that's best practice, like I said, I'd love to hear your opinion. Thanks for your help."
"Eh, with a proper demo hammer tile doesn't take long to lift in &gt;95% of cases. Most of the thinset can be chipped off with the demo hammer with the right attachment, grinder would only be used to smooth out the remnants remaining afterwards. I did an uplift the other day just under 90sqft where they'd used a 1/2"" trowel under 1'x1' tiles, had all tile uplifted in around 1 1/2 hrs, thinset took around 3 hours to chip away (just using a small kango as opposed to a proper demo hammer), then half an hour to smooth the concrete with the grinder in prep for sheet vinyl. Total time from leaving base to getting back after emptying van, 6 hours, and it was around a 20-25 min drive either way.If the tile isn't flat, it was probably just a DIY tile job :P But yeah, concrete could be shitty underneath.Floating floor squeaks are almost always caused by hollows around seams. Floor needs to be made more flat, which is failure in floor prep. Concrete can be patched up easily, tile requires some pricey primers designed for going over non-porous substrate/material."
"If you have a 3-gang box, that should be plenty of room unless you have a bunch of other wires. Box fill calculations are part of the electrician exams but essentially each 12 wire counts as 2.5 in^(3) and 14 wire as 2 and grounds all count as 1.  Each device counts as double the biggest wire and each box should tell you how big it is and some even tell you how many wires you can fit. Since you're not trying to pass the test, just go to an online calculator: [https://www.constructionmonkey.com/calculations/electrical/boxfill](https://www.constructionmonkey.com/calculations/electrical/boxfill) &amp;#x200B;Anyway, they DO make a 12-4 but I have never seen one out in the wild.  There is nothing wrong the way you did it so just keep the wires.  It's really not THAT hard now that we've figured out that switch but you have to make sure and label all your switch legs for now and in the future when you open it!  Keep the lights on the top two using the red and blue tails and the rest won't matter.  Most people put heat in the bottom since it's the least used. "
"I worked as an overnight cleaner doing gyms (which feels like it is 90% their bathrooms and showers) for a number of years and I use only four products to clean my house. The absolute best way to clean windows/mirrors/glass without a doubt is hot water, a little bit of dish soap and elbow grease. It cleans so much better than windex or any other cleaner I have used. Plus it is as cheap as it gets. Toilet bowl cleaner. I find all toilet bowl cleaner is pretty much the same and I just buy whatü__s on sale. Floor cleaner. Depends on what type of flooring you have. I have hardwood floors and prefer Bona floor cleaner. I prefer it over all others, but OrangeGlo is very good as well. Counters/tub/toilet/sink. Again, there isnü__t a huge difference between them but I prefer Hydrogen Peroxide based cleaner so I use Lysol bathroom spray cleaner. Other than that I have a few one-off cleaners that I use rarely. I have hard water so I sometimes soak my shower head in CLR. I wash my shower curtain in the washing machine on gentle once a month. I have a wife and a two year old and two cats so I give the bathroom a mild cleaning every Wednesday and a thorough cleaning every weekend. Also my wife has long hair so I have a dedicated pair of needle nose pliers under the sink for removing hair from the tub drain. "
"Oh so much... here's all I can think of right now:- Ask people at hardware stores for advice, they know a lot.- Make sure you know what your end goal is, will lead your project.- Tools are very important. Consider getting a better tool if you will be using it. Some of the tools I have purchased turned out to be quite useless and I ended up just getting a better one/different one. But at the same time, don't purchase tools unnecessarily. - Take your time! I messed in several areas where I was rushing/didn't pay enough attention, and now I notice those little mistakes every day. And feel free to ask others' opinion on how stuff looks. - Don't be afraid to go with a different look. Sample pieces look a lot different than a full room of wood, so don't let that sway you completely. - I feel like drywall is quite tricky, so get some advice before doing drywall stuff (kind of funny to me, as my dad has specialized in drywall work). - Electrical work needs to be done in a certain way, or it won't be up to code. Make sure you either have an electrician advise or do your work, or find out what you need to do to be up to code. A lot is possible, but need to take special precautions. - Get kneepads, gloves, and comfy eye protection. Make sure its comfortable for you, as it will be a lifesaver, and will eventually not even notice you have on eye protection or kneepads. In terms of the actual work, I could tell you a lot, but would need to be more specific. I by all means do not know everything,  but if you need any specific advice, let me know! Hope this helps!"

"What do you mean by ""convert"" an older insert?  The new ones have to meet EPA regulations and they are tested to meet them.  There are nothing that can be done to an older stove or inserts as far as I know besides replacing them with new ones.Are you burning 24/7 when using a face cord every two weeks?"
"What if I have one just like this, but it's missing the mounting screws? It's just sticking out of a hole in the cinder block going into the crawlspace. Its flush with he outside, but it's not screwed in. The edges of the hole in the cinder block are chipped away, so screws would not get enough purchase."
"What trim materials are you using, what paint exactly; please supply pics of what's going on.Also rolling paint will always create a texture, and needs to be back brushed after rolling.

"Whoa. Good to know. Yeah we have major water damage on our current floors (engineered hardwood). Lost a roof in hurricane Florence, and have to gut some stuff. We decided to put in something more durable so we no longer have to worry about spills, wet feet, etc. Thanks for that. Really good to know! "
"Wow. Seriously, wow. So they powerwashed your already leaky roof? Can you get up into the attic? You're going to want to get that dried out ASAP.

"You should do a lot of reading and research beyond what you're gonna get in a Reddit thread.

"is that in a door hinge?  almost looks like something got squashed between the hinge.. would be a weird place for mold to grow, could be something that was fibrous and that's why it seems fuzzy.

"**Look for an open neutral upstream of the outlet**The tester is a fairly simple device, and the test legends are quite abbreviated. There are several faults that can give the combination of two lights that is labelled ""hot ground reverse"", and the most common reason that that will show up is because the neutral has no contact at some point before the outlet.

"I can see the cruddy drywall work they did to cover over the milkman door, does that count? :D  My home is a fairly small blue collar house. It's only like 1200 sq ft with the attic, 800+ on the main floor, so there's not a lot of room for stuff to hide. The neatest bit of untouched detail was a kick plate in the baseboard for the old furnase chain ""gilt edge furnace Co. Milwaukee WI"" the chain and damper control were gone. i found another one and thought about rigging it up, but after finishing the walls and hanging photos I'm thinking I might forgo it. "
"I don't agree with the assessment that there is no contract.  With a written estimate followed by a discussion regarding a start date, there is documentation of a ""Notice to Proceed"".  This implies an agreement to the estimate and the terms and conditions identified within it.  This may or may not hold up in court, but barring any other executed contract, this is the closest thing to a defined (and implicitly agreed) scope and cost.  The Ts&amp;Cs might not be enforceable, but the scope and cost certainly is.  As they are in verbal construction contracts."
"I have been going through this too for two and a half years. I still get random things but itü__s improved drastically. I signed up for a lot of the other comments recommendations for sites that stop the mail but what really helped was contacting each company.

I tried the return to send, not at this address over and over and most of the time Iü__d still keep getting the mail. "
"I have cracks in my drywall that look identical to that, and they're seasonal due to the foundation shifting (old foundation on clay) when it rains. I haven't seen a house built on stone like that before, but I would guess that the foundation doesn't have much internal stability and flexes with the ground, causing your house to shift too.I think the answer is to have a foundation inspection done to assess what's happening. Ultimately it will probably come down to spending $10k+ to repair the foundation, or just accept that you'll have seasonal cracking."
I think if it's his forever home it's not an issue.  I noticed there's a heater in the budget.  When I was last looking at homes we nearly put in an offer on a house owned by a total gear head.  Beautiful heated garage.  Epoxy paint over expertly finished concrete floor.  Custom cabinetry for tools.  This guys passion was obviously cars and his garage was usable square footage.  It wasn't for everyone but we seriously considered making an offer and I'd put my woodworking gear in that garage.... Did I mention it was across the street from my in-laws.      
"I tile over vinyl occasionally, recently tiled a small toilet over some asbestos containing vinyl. Glued and nailed the cbu according to hardies spec with nails every 150mm and 75mm around edges. If concrete substrate and it's a foam core vinyl don't do it. Technically you can tile over it but no one will warranty it and if it needs to be replaced the old vinyl will come up with it. I did tile a kitchen 6 years ago over a soft vinyl and it's holding up no issues but it's not a good idea, and was only done as I was specifically asked not to remove it. "
"If there's no deflection then you can place cement board directly over the hardwood and then tile straight over that. Cement board is not waterproof, it's not a bad idea to place a coat of redgard or similar over it prior to tiling.If there's deflection, it's best to remove the hardwood, replace with ply and then cement board. Most adhesives cannot go directly onto plywood.Schluter is not a bad idea.You can also use compressed fibre cement sheeting to create the subfloor, it's basically 18mm hardies. We use it on high end residential (6m homes etc) "
"Try drawing everything that is within six or so inches of the box hole as if the box was removed from the wall.  So there will be a box sized hole in the wall and ?... inside the wall and ?...  I am old and really couldn't figure out your original image.  This drawing is worse.  Way too much irrelevant information.  Not trying to figure out how to rebuild your house.  Just trying to figure out the box and what is inside the hole in the wall.  Try drawing a 3-D pic.  Could throw in some measurements.  Doubtful any measurements need to be greater than 6""."
"Unfortunately, not a lot you can do. Most likely cause is flexure in the substrate.  I am guessing the previous owner took up the carpet/hardwood/vinyl and simply spread some thinset and laid the tile.  In most instances, a cement board underlayment is set in a grout bed or some other base is added to the subfloor to help prevent the damage you see.  As bad as it sounds, you may want to take the floor up and redo it.  If you donü__t want the spend for tile, you can do any number of laminates.  They do not require additional strengthening of the substrate."
"Having done a couple kitchen remodels and having worked in the restaurant industry I would strongly recommend Quartz or stainless steel for countertop products. Both materials allow you to pull hot pans straight out of the oven or off the fire and put the hot pans directly on the countertop. I cannot tell you how useful this is. My current kitchen was built about 3 years ago with an island at 7.5ft by 5.5ft with a restaurant grade burner in the island, with a sink and fridge behind me as I cook, and the double oven on the far wall. I will regularly pull a pan from the fire and place on the counter next to the sink or pull pans from the oven and transfer directly to the counter. If you like the look of the wood, you can try building a large counter depth butcher block instead and display it as a show piece."
"I recommend that you [read this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/9hub71/just_over_4000_floor_to_ceiling_kitchen_remodel/e6fay73/) I was involved in last month. IKEA's wood countertop options are almost all particle board with a thin veneer. There are a few issues with that: First, you will be limited to sanding it very little, at risk of sanding through the veneer. This is counter-intuitive (hah!) to the benefit of having butcher block counters, which is that they can be sanded down and refinished ad infinitum. Second, you'll have to make sure it's sealed so no water can ever EVER get through to the particle board, because particle board swells up like a balloon when it gets wet.That herringbone pattern is pretty, but for longevity and dependability, so with a solid wood product."
"If somebody owns a home (not even factoring in the massive amount of renovations this particular homeowner made) it should be safely assumed that a purchase under $500 is affordable. Even if a person couldn't afford to buy it right this second and would need to save up for a while, it would be weird to assume someone can afford a house (the upkeep, the taxes, more than likely the mortgage) and yet clearly not living on the brink of poverty, cannot save less than $45 per month. Shit even if you were below the poverty line, you could cover that cost with fewer than 25 plasma donations. Yes income and means varies person to person. But considering the subreddit, it's pretty safe to assume that worthwhile purchases under a couple thousand dollars could be justified as worthwhile to save towards for a while. "
"This is what we are going to do, wife actually came up with the idea.We have a small yard, that has a slope with a fence on top of it. Our deck basically cuts the yard in half as there is a flower bed on the slope. It's a pain to mow and not very useful as the deck is cramped and the actual yard is small and doesn't have much level spots. I was wracking my brain to come up with a solution, including extending the deck. Also thought of making patios on each side of the deck. She said, why don't we just get rid of the deck (looks bad anyway, needs refinished) and put steps out the back door then put a patio on the rest of the yard that is level? Genius! Probably will be a couple years out as we have other projects lined up in front of this one, but I'm looking forward to getting a more useful back yard. "
"Veteran of many old houses and being poor here.  You can get sheets of that rigid blue foam insulation very cheap.  Cut it just a little bigger than the doors of rooms you don't use often, and wedge it into the door frames.  This is obvious, but use a draft blocker under exterior doors if you don't already, and re-do the weatherstripping around the doors.  If you are losing heat through the walls themselves you can actually drape the walls with blankets (packing blankets work well)  It looks like crap but it does help - especially in a bedroom or something where you might not care what it looks like.  Same with the floors, if you have wood  you can add rugs (or packing blankets with non skid underneath.)  Just make sure you don't close a room up so much that you end up with moisture or ventilation issues. "
" My thought is that by not having a railing you are still exposing yourself to liability.  A small porch a foot off the ground is one thing. A big deck is another thing altogether. For instance, a small porch is a transition. You are entering or leaving a home. So you will instinctively look where you are going or be careful. You are aware you are in that transition space and more aware of the surroundings.On a larger deck space, you are in a different mind set and not paying attention. Perhaps people had a few drinks etc. and you are talking to someone with your back to the edge of the deck. Not thinking you take a step back when someoneü__s passing by.    No railing youü__re off the edge. In your 20ü__s not a bad fall, itü__s only a foot.   But the 60 or 70 year old grandma with osteoporosis?  She broke a wrist, or her hip.  Now if she was an unrelated neighbor sheü__s going to sue you for her care.  Iü__d put up railings. My sis-in-law fell down some steps at her husbands brothers and sued him.  Kind of made their relationship a little bitter. "
"I got one for free but like everyone else mentioned it's not free.  I paid $400 of an EZ Pad and $300 for a mover.  I don't remember what I paid the electricians to install it because there did other work as well.  It worked when I first got it but things started breaking shortly afterwards.  Fortunately they're surprisingly easy to fix if you're comfortable doing mechanical stuff.  I've replaced a few parts and had to fix leaks a lot.   [Backyard Plus](http://www.backyardplus.com/) has been amazing for finding replacement parts but I think they're limited on what brands they actually have parts for.  I've used Marlig's Fix A Leak a lot and I think it works great, it's just not always permanent.  I've probably used it 3-4 times now in as many years.  It beats tearing up the foam to find a leak, which I've also done.Is it worth it?  We probably use our hottub weekly, even more now that we're getting in to winter.  It depends on whether you'll actually use it or not.  A lot of people get one and use it at first but eventually stop, so it all depends on you."
"baseboard radiant is a poor supplemental heat[in the traditional sense] because it is so slow to react.Not uncommon to use your boiler to maintain 60 f ? and heat your living room with wood/pellet/direct vent gas fireplace.By far the best ""bang for your buck"" is air sealing and insulation in your attic. Perhaps second [depending on how many windows] is insulating window treatments.You can build or buy covers for your baseboards. That said, I think folks ""over worry"" about furniture placement with hot water baseboards, particularly with every wall covered with them. They don't get hot enough 2"" away to damage anything [maybe a piano?]  They are considered ""radiant"" emitters but truthfully I suspect they use convection to heat the air transferred from the floor through the fins. Note that they have louvers to reduce the output which simply block this airflow.Converting to gas [not propane] is also a selling point for your property...Edit  folks suggesting hot air conversion have likely never felt the comfort of hot water baseboards in a cold climate"

"I'm by NO means an expert here, but i think what you've got going on is expansion/contraction. Since the garage is cold, the ducts have contracted, then you're suddenly blowing heat through them, causing them to expand and audibly pop.-I would think that insulating your garage _could_ help. However it's still going to be unconditioned space. There's still going to be a temperature difference between your house and garage, causing a greater amount of expansion and contraction than inside your house (especially at night when the temp is at it's coldest)."
"On the 2x4  realize  they should be 1 1/2 x3 1/2. Could  measure 15/8x 3 3/4  maybe when wet. Anything getting close to  to normal 1/8 or so will be fine.

"So a few things:* It's entirely possible that this guy doesn't know what he's doing.  * He may also be doing preliminary assessment in order to ""scope the job"" so see how many guys, etc., and the real crew may be better equipped.* Finally, understand you need to reference against ambient.

"This looks like a rolled on texture using a paint roller. The trick is to figure out how thin the mud should be and how thick a nap should be on the roller. I would try a 3/4 inch nap and mud that is pretty thin for this texture, like that of a thick soup or something. Start to heavy and work your way down. But here is a big trick, add about 1 cup of paint or primer in the texture for each gallon of texture.

"Vermiculite is a mineral, and the same processes which result in vermiculite formation can also produce asbestos. The Libby mine in Montana was a source of a fuck-ton of vermiculite used in construction, and the vermiculite mined there was contaminated with several forms of asbestos that are not so good for you.And yes, asbestos itself was used for insulation.

"the amount is incredibly high for Iowa, unless you are putting in some very difficult things like several 220 volt outlets the number should be closer to 30 or 40 thousand in my opinion. the reason your proposals may not be very detailed is because of the time it takes to put something detail together and then you might not even choose their company. this is the issue with free estimates in my opinion. the other reason why the amount might be a little bit higher is because it's better to under-promise and overachieve, especially in the case of referrals."

"My recommendation is to get a ruler and measure the hole diameter. This will give you an approximate bolt size. Then purchase a few sizes in that range both in US and metric. Just buy one of each for now. Try to screw each one in by hand. If it stops after one or two turns and you cannot turn it by hand, it is the wrong thread. Shouldnü__t be more than a few dollars to get every bolt in that size range. I would expect you to buy 4 or 6 bolts to find the right one.Note: it is possible that the threads are just sticking and require a little force but try every bolt first to avoid stripping.Edit: once you have the thread size, the rest is easy. Figure out the length you need by measuring the thickness of all the parts that bolt together, and the head type to match the previous bolts (hex or allen probably)"
"Ugh. I have a closed in porch like this as well. They incorporated it into the living room when they internalized it.

I found out from my new neighbor later on it used to be an outdoor porch they essentially just framed in. Then winter came and Canadian winter handily demonstrated how big a screw up building that porch in was.... the floors are freezing and have no access to the underside without tearing up the hardwood and subfloor. In a year or two I'm going to just tear the damn thing off or turn it back into an exterior porch.

"Burn down your house. Kidding.They're not that hard to get rid of if you do a thorough sweep, but you need to check everything in your cabinets. Pay special attention to grains and grain based items...flour, pasta, cake mixes, crackers, cookies, etc. Toss anything with bugs in the garbage and take out the trash. If it looks like they're contained to one bag of flour, then that's probably how they got carried in and they probably didn't spread. If you find them in multiple items or crawling in cabinets, just throw every soft packaged (not cans or jars) item in that cabinet away.  Clean out cabinets and vacuum all the corners and creases to hopefully get any larvae. Wipe out cabinets with white vinegar. They're pretty common, so if you do a Google search on how to get rid of weevils or pantry bugs, you'll probably find some nice articles that give better details.ETA: that's if they're actually pantry bugs. I've never seen another bug get into flour...but I've also never seen weevils hang out all over the house. Hopefully you can find a valid ID!"
"&gt;A sump pump is a small pump installed in the lowest part of a basement or crawlspace. Its job is to help keep the area under the building dry and to prevent it from floodÙ–ing. Usually, sump pumps are installed in specially constructed sump pits. Water flows into the sump pit through drains or by natural water migration through the soil. The sump pump's job is to pump the water out of the pit and away from the building so the basement or crawlspace stays dry.- Explanation by [howstuffworks' website](https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/plumbing/sump-pump.htm)With a high water table you always have water/moisture sitting above the foundations of your basement - it's where it naturally tends to sit around. This causes water to seep into the basement through both the walls and the foundation... constantly. So you need interior drainage to run it off to the sump pit. It's simply a fact of life in some basements.In the situation you're describing, the water table is only raising through excessive ground moisture (if even that - proper exterior drainage/grading may fix that water issue entirely as it may not necessarily be a water table issue itself), which means you're only going over the level of the basement irregularly. A high water table will consistently sit above that point consistently."
"Typically the smoke detectors in an apt building are there to alert you that you have an issue like burned toast before setting off the buildings fire system, and are not connected to it.  There is probably an annunciator (horn/speaker) in your unit (it might have a strobe light attached to it) but this device does not look like a smoke detector and usually is on the wall. This device is connected to the main fire panel and will send a signal if it is disconnected.One issue you will have if they are that old is the pigtail (the plug that snaps in the back) may not fit the new detectors so you will need to shut off the power and re-wire those. There is a red wire that connects the detectors to each other and the black and white wires are hot and neutral for power. The new pigtail will have colored wires so just match the colors. In this setup the batteries are only there as back-up power. The detector will chirp when the batteries eventually wear out.Keep in mind this is the *typical* scenario. I have seen buildings where all the detectors are wired into the panel so it can happen. The problem with this setup is the building is evacuated every time someone burns food, or more accurately everyone ignores the alarm because it goes off so frequently. Check with your maintenance dept if you want to be certain."
"Lots of good alternatives in the PDF. You did some homework before posting!Looking at your image, it's hard to tell if the blocks reduced the bearing area between the joists and beam under it. If so, it doesn't make sense that the joist load is concentrated at the block. Is there a gap between the joist and the underlying beam on either side of the block?I have not had the problem you have, so I'll just post a couple of thoughts. It appears only one room has this issue. 6x6 on each joist seems like overkill. You'll reduce width between joists from a current 14"" to 11"" which is likely to make it harder to drill holes and reroute electrical and plumbing later (may need angle head drill or something like it). Do you have a lot of squeaks from the sub flooring attached to the top of the joists? Are any joists bowed or sagging such that the subfloor above is separated from the joist in localized spots? If so, you may want to address that with any solution you pursue.Are the water pipes galvanized? If so, replacing with copper would save effort later when galvanized rusts out.Is the entire floor bouncy or hopefully just one or two joists? Have one person walking on the floor while another is in the basement with a vertical stick attempting to find joists with the greatest deflection. I'm wondering if you could apply the easiest solution to one or two neighboring joists and notice a significant improvement there, which then suggests that the easiest solution is adequate anywhere else it is needed. If the easiest solution (plywood) doesn't work, I suppose you could knock it off and step up to the next solution, removing electrical, plumbing and installing 2x6. Knocking off plywood attached with adhesive will require considerable effort. Best to install without adhesive, to see if plywood alone is sufficient on one or two test joists. If so, you can add adhesive later. I would prefer using screws rather than nails, carriage bolts or lag bolts. Screws with adhesive should be adequate.I'm also wondering if plywood in a damp basement would eventually delaminate."
"What /u/reluminate said. Cut it like molding or trim. They call it ""tear out"", when the blade causes part of the workpiece to splinter or tear out. Circ saw will be fine, just use an appropriate blade (manufacturer's recommendations, straight-meaning not bent/warped, not dull, not missing teeth, etc.) and go slow. Cut twice and measure once... Wait... Seriously when you are cutting upside down, especially with directional stuff (tongue &amp; groove, or stuff that snaps together) you have to pay attention and at corners/edges, complicated stuff just give yourself a sanity check before every cut. If not you'll get over-confident and screw up a section. (ask me how I know this :) Not hard, framing square and circ saw is great for flooring. Depending on width (BE CAREFUL) you can shove a contractor's pencil into the protective slide of the saw to get it out of the way. But watch yourself and again, don't rush/get cocky... You WILL forget and put the saw down with the blade still spinning. (ask me how I know that) A good (quality) tape will be your friend, not Horrible Freight crap. (ask me how I know that too) Personally I like the Milwaukee 25ft (non-magnetic because I do a lot of metal work) tapes. I don't need a 30ft Big Max tape. Doesn't matter whether you use a crappy tape or a $1,000 tape --just don't combine a good quality tape and a crappy one. The guy using the Horrible Freight tape (that is 1/16""-1/8"" off) is going to measure and tell you a number. Then you (with the good tape) are going to exactly measure the incorrect distance. Either use one tape or use many decent/accurate tapes. The kerf is the width of the blade, or the material that the blade takes from the workpiece. Typically it's about 1/8"". [Here](https://imgur.com/xQYdbl8) is an example of how to mark and cut. Sometimes people use an X, sometimes a strike or a check. The side with the mark, X, check, etc. is the side you want the BLADE (kerf) to be on. See the arrow, that's what you measure to and that's what you cut to. Go to Home Depot and buy a $1.01 piece of garbage 1x4 from the culls pile and practice. Measure to the line then strike or check the kerf side (so you don't get confused later) and keep the blade on the X side of the line. That way you can mark 5-6 planks and know which side to cut. And don't forget, it doesn't need to be perfect... Baseboards will hide your sins. (baseboards go over the floor, so edges/ends don't need to be EXACTLY perfect. And if you paint your baseboards first, when you nail them on you only need to caulk/spackle the nail holes then lightly sand/paint those, not the whole board (no mess with worrying about getting paint on the new floor). Sorry, that got long. Hope it helps. If you get stuck there will be people here on /r/HomeImprovement who have learned from plenty of mistakes! Good luck! "

"A couple of things to keep in mind if you move forward with this line of thought:How will it affect the value of the home when it comes time to sell it?If this is a bedroom then you have to (not *just* a code requirement but a damn good idea as well) have a second means of egress besides the main door."
"A gallon of XYLENE ($10?) from the big box store. Was original main ingredient in Goof Off. Read instructions and MSDA.Like others said use a razor blade scraper.

"Ah okay, my installer had a different opinion because the wood was 'lower quality' according to him, its some form of poplar. I think even now (40 days after install completed) I could put water on a board out there and it would still bead off.EDIT: I meant this as a thank you for putting me at ease :)"

"Another piece of advice depending on your situation: Do remove the trim before you do the flooring. If you replace it, by the 10 packs at the store. That can cut cost in half and allow you to go taller (better)  If you go white, watch YouTube videos on how to caulk and you can make the seem very smooth."
"Arc fault protection is required for most new circuits in current code (locale depending, obviously). Installing the breaker is no different than installing any other breaker.

Caulk and paint that bad boy. Use foam backer rod in the large gaps. Prime first with oil primer. Cedar likes to bleed through paint and caulk over time. Caulk all the seams after you prime.

"Compaction helps, but depending on the soil and the rainfall, it generally lasts less than concrete before it loosens. A dry spell will shrink clay soil, and a wet spell will cause it to expand - this will mean loose/moving posts. Concrete stabilises the ground around the post much ore than the most alone."

"Get multiple quotes, we can't guess at a cost online without knowing specifics.It can be done without replacing the ceiling completely for sure.

"If the dryer is running but not heating, you most likely have a dryer problem. It's clearly receiving power.

If you have a nice flat surface XPS rigid foam with expandable foam to seal it to your studs is very good as well. The really big benefit to spray foam is the ability to cover uneven surfaces and air seal in old basements. If you have a reasonably well built modern house spray foam may be overkill for you.

My hardwood installer strongly advised against Bruce. Something about the quality of the boards and how it was really hard to install the outer areas of the room that had to be hand nailed as the boards would bow. He had been installing hardwood his whole life and basically said choose anything but Bruce. 
"No such thing. The green/purple board is *mold* resistant, but any drywall is going to fall apart when it gets wet.The mold resistant drywall is for bathrooms and other areas where the humidity is frequently elevated. Given OP's description of his basement, there's probably not any advantage to using it."

The landlord needs to have the apartment professionally cleaned before you move in. After you take possession you request the cleaners return.  Then if there is a window in the bathroom keep it cracked open and open it wider right after shower..  You can also get a small dehumidifier to run.  Should be ok.

"Ah. Yeah, drywall will help a lot with that. If you go from the 1/2"" ultralight stuff up to the 5/8"" fire-rated stuff you nearly double the mass, which should help a little. Hanging 70lb sheets of drywall on the ceiling won't be fun, but that's a cheap way to improve things a bit.Beyond that, you just don't want to share HVAC branches between floors--but like I said, that might require a little more engineering than just ""run another branch"". But it's likely engineering homework you'd want to do anyways if adding significant square footage to your system."
"I have a good chunk of my house wired, but I did it myself.  CAT6 is ideal.  CAT 5e is fine too if its significantly cheaper.  If price is close get the 6 as it is more future proof.  As for cost that is going to be hard to say as the layout of your house will factor in greatly.  An electrician will likely do it cheaper than a computer guy, but the electrician will rarely terminate the ends, they just run the cabling.  Terminating is super simple and doesn't require expensive tools (just an inexpensive punchdown tool) so you would be ok doing that yourself."
"I have both of these toilets. They are exactly the same except the ultramax ii is the 1-piece version vs 2-piece Drake.There really isn't a difference, but the one benefit is that if you hold down the flusher, it will unload about 1.6g vs 1.28g, so you have the best of both worlds.The one thing I hate about these toilets is that they generally don't clog, but when they do, it's really clogged and super fucking messy and splashy. And you need to get a different plunger, one that looks like a bee's nest vs the regular plunger which basically doesn't work."
I have several hundred square feet of porcelain tile in my house. I discovered the bissell crosswave about a year ago and i don't consider my floors clean without using it weekly. I have a small 14 pound dog in the house that sheds very little. The bissell vacuum pulls little hairballs from places they aren't seen. I had no idea until I started using it that he sheds more than i thought he did. The bissell is super easy to clean up and the dirty water canister let's you know how dirty your floor actually is. I don't think you would be disappointed with it. 
"Its the simple things that I love the most. First project after we moved in was sorting out night lights for the bathrooms.

Projects that take a day or two tops and don't blow up in your face are always fun."
"My preference is to stain and seal in place solely so I can fill the nail holes (use Bona Pacific Filler, by the way... takes up stain better than any other wood filler I've ever used). As for attachment, use some silicone (not much - you don't wanna squeeze any out) and a few finish nails. Countersink your nails, fill, light sand, stain, and poly. As for matching your stain, that's gonna be trial and error. Get a scrap piece of pine and some stain samples. You might have to mix. Old Masters is my preferred stain. You may want a wiping stain for this job."
"Plastic covers are a good idea if youü__re in an area prone to flash floods or has a high water table. Neighbours of mine have them, but being as I am at the top of the hill, Iü__ve forgone them.

"They often do, and if you pull one out it'll probably have DIMMABLE stamped around where all the other identification marks are.If not, it'll still have a model number stamped on there you can google.Worst case, grab one and throw it in a dimmable light fixture and see what happens. Your chances are pretty good since most new LED bulbs are dimmable these days.Or just ask your contractor if he remembers what he installed. When I had work done the electrical subcontractor used a very small set of bulbs in their jobs, so they knew what they put in there."
"Was wondering this too. Consumer reports and several appliance blogs recommended Samsung and even just from playing with them in the stores itü__s the only one that doesnü__t feel like a cheap POS (not including high end brands).

Biggest complaint Iü__ve seen with Samsung is long waits for parts and service technicians, yet if you look at reviews for Whirlpool or GE itü__s the same complaints.

"We explored our legal options and the laws pertaining to the home inspector summed up are he doesn't have to inspect hardly anything and doesn't have to report everything he finds for a variety of legal reasons.The home owners are protected by our ""buyer beware"" laws here.

"We must have found all the landlords lurking who down voted our posts lmao.  I have had it out with a few landlords who demanded I do this or that but it wasn't actually in the agreement/lease.

"What is your opinion on epoxy grout? I had the new guy come over yesterday to look at my shower.

He mentioned a step below epoxy for him was Mapei CQ? I believe, which he said works really well too. I'm honestly thinking about doing the entire shower and bathroom floor in the epoxy grout though.

"Whats not fun is trying to repair a copper line inside a wall. Ive done it 2 times and it scares me that I might burn the house down. Both time I built a cage around the area I wanted to fix with flashing. I then got a spray bottle of water and wet everything down before I started putting the flame on the pipe. Occasionally I would spray the nearby stud that was starting to smolder.I am loving pex now. I try to use it where ever I can in the house. I just make sure I go 1/4"" larger than the copper I'm replacing. It's so much easier to use in tight spaces."
"Whats the humidity level in your home during the winter like? Is your home air sealed pretty good?If you only need to make up a small amount of humidity you can get by with an evaporation unit such as the Aprilaire 600. They are only ~$200.My experience has been that they do not make up enough humidity if you don't have a tight home and need to make up a lot of humidity in dry winters. I typically see humidity of only 20% despite setting a target of 36%. But my house is from the 70's, has slight leakage (2500 sqft).Steam humidifiers work a lot better."
"When it comes to anything tiling related, we always refer to manufacturer spec and if in doubt we'll directly contact a rep or call their support line.With trade level products comes a warranty of the products integrity from the manufacturer, provided the installer has followed their directions correctly, otherwise it's known as an installation failure (hint: it's rare with the good brands such as Mapei for a failure to be anything but that) and you'd then be looking to chase the installer as opposed to the manufacturer.They (Mapei among a few other brands) lab test their stuff quite extensively, so the manufacturer and/or their rep(s) will in 99% of cases have better advice than joe average from a tiling supply store, joe average the tiler, or joe average the builder.As far as salespeoples advice goes.. I've worked in flooring for a number of years now. I've seen more of the sales side than most flooring installers by value of a quirky situation. While I cannot speak for absolutely everywhere, I'd be pretty confident in saying 95+% of salespeople in flooring have very little fucking idea when it actually comes to working with the product(s) in install. The 5% are the ex-installers whose bodies are too buggered to continue doing that so they've retired into a cushy sales job. Aka the grouchy old guys :P "
"Instead of just heavy  plywood, which in your case will require 5/8"" or 3/4"" to keep from buckling, buy a [24"" wide hollow core slab door](https://www.menards.com/main/doors-windows-millwork/interior-doors/interior-slab-doors/mastercraft-reg-hardwood-flush-interior-door-only/4091015/p-1444448144437.htm).

It shouldn't be necessary to extend the plywood the full length of the door.  A foot short on both ends might suffice.

I used a slab hollow core door for years and it worked much better than plywood did.  100% chance the dumbsit that downvoted this has never tried it.  Probably has never been in an attic. 2' x 8' piece of 3/4"" plywood weights anywhere from 70% to 100% more than that 2' hollow core slab door.  I climbed through hundreds of attics using a 2' wide hollow core door.Edit:  Chopping off both ends of a long surfboard would be better if it was a little wider and flat on top. Maybe a 60s shape would work due to parallel rails.  A rectangular flat top board using foam sandwich construction about 7' long 2' wide and 2"" thick would be about the optimum. Even  lighter and stronger than a hollow core door."
"Had to do this. Youü__re going to get some cracked tile so you live with that risk or you spend thousands on a pro. Make sure itü__s legal for you to do this yourself in your city/state. I called and asked in person to be sure. The guy at the state level was awesome. I told him what I planned to do and he said itü__s legal and even said my game plan was legit. He also said Vinyl Asbestos Tile is mostly harmless and even disposal is pretty simple - I could bring it to a landfill legally but that if I told the people there theyü__d probably kick me out. He didnü__t tell me to lie - just not to mention it. If you want to go the whole 9 yards:First of all, get a 3m mask with the appropriate rating. If you arenü__t sure you can call the number on the package and they will tell you if it will block it. The lady on the phone said ü__I donü__t recommend you do this hit the mask will block itü_ù. Second: Tarp up your doorways. You donü__t want anything escaping. I did two layers on ingress and egress just to be safe. Third: Wear clothes you will throw away on the spot. Or change into those clothes. Fourth: Buy a HEPA air purifier and leave it running in the room. Some people say a window fan working as exhaust is fine - thatü__s probably true with VAT but you may annoy a neighbor. Fifth:  Find a pry bar with a rubber tip. Very carefully slide it under and pull the nail out. Tile breaks are going to happen but you donü__t want to scrape the tile as you go in. Sixth: Spray any broken tiles with a water bottle. Remove any broken tile. Seven: Spray rest of floor and Shop vac. HEPA rated vacuum is a plus but if you run a filter for a few days itü__s probably overkill for their price. Eight: If youü__re putting a floor over the tile, then fill the removed tiles with feathering cement. Nine: Remember to remove staples as well. This is just off the top of my head so someone feel free to interject if I forgot something. Note that most of these precautions are overkill. VAT is just not that dangerous but I decided itü__s better to be safe than sorry. "

Sounds like your door is hinge bound meaning the hinge is completely closed before the door is completely closed.

"
"Yeah, that's true. I'll scratch out that suggestion. Grinding is, of course, ideal. But as you mentioned, asbestos is a potential concern. Leveling compound would safely encapsulate it (if present) and handle the unevenness without having to rent a grinder and generate all that dust. That's a lot of hassle."
"You can buy the strips and screw them into place.As for wainscotting, I would suggest cement board or at the very least purple board.  Nothing with any wood in it.

"You can just vacuum it (once the fireplace is completely cold, obviously), but it might be worth paying for a professional cleaning and inspection so that you can put it on your property disclosure that it was last serviced October 2018 or whatever.

"walls usually not the problem, the foundation is what is often overlooked.  Is the kitchen addition built over a basement? A crawl space? or slab on grade?  The issue is how to tie roofs in.

"I don't know anything about the wood or finish other than that I can tell that it was laid then finished all together, and from viewing the side of a piece can see the top layer thickness and learn that it has only one full refinish in it.

Other damage is gouge type scratches that are pretty big in some cases. Those are some options that I can try though, I've read ideas on how to find out what the finish is."

The key to the full demo as to not have to fool around with door and window jams is put a layer of the lath on the face of the wall studs and then put on your 1/2"" drywall, at least in my case, these brough my finish wall surface back to where the original plaster and lath was and I had to do no additional work to make jambs or trim work.  I used construction adhesive alone with 1"" finish nails (air nailer) to attached the lath and then use 2"" drywall screws for the drywall"
"I'm not sure I agree that my losses are that negligible. It may only be a few degrees of cooling air, but that's a few degrees with a lot of mass flow, representing a lot of energy. I estimate it could be 6000 BTU/hr of losses through the ducts when heating/cooling, and still half that when only the fan is running for circulation. Definitely going to be air sealing the attic before blowing insulation, though, like you say. I'm losing a lot of heat through the ceiling and can see the tops of most of the 2x6 ceiling joists. That's just not enough insulation."
"Impossible to give quotes without seeing the job.  You're going to need to contact plumbers to give you estimates.  &gt;There is a concrete foundation, but I'm not sure if it would go through that or if it would go above the concrete.The hose bib will typically be installed through the sill plate above the foundation.  If it were through the foundation it would be too low to the ground to be useable.  You could try calling local plumbers and see if they'll give you a ballpark over the phone, but I'm betting they won't even quote it without seeing it.  "
"It looks like someone insulated the outlet, but removing it depends on what type of insulation they used. How much of the sealant is visible? My suggestion would be to kill power to the switch and try and cut with a razor blade carefully around the outside, assuming you can see fairly well the extent of the insulation job. Prying will likely be what you'll have to do, but the more of the seal you cut, the less chance of damage there will be. It's just to prevent drafts through the wall switch so it may be something you'll want to replace with the new switch."
"Iü__d like to point out as well, use your bristles as a guide. If you stick the brush on the wall 1/4 inch below where you want your cut line to be, smush the brush in until the bristles are where you want, you can just pull the brush along and youü__ll have a clean cut. Putting your wrist on the wall for support below as you pull is a good one too. Make sure to feather out the paint line towards the rest of the wall youü__ll roll after so that you donü__t leave lines. Use a good quality angled sash brush, Wooster or Purdy. Source: am professional painter "

"There is a cool tool you can buy to greatly ease in removal of lath and plaster. It looks like a 6' long two pronged fork. It pries the lath from.inside the wall cavity while ridingup the stud. Crooked studs arent a problem. The wood used then was 10,000 times higher grade than you buy now, and it was held straight by hundreds of lath nails, lath strips, and mortar. All dor jambs will.need removed and ripped narrower, lath walls are 1"" thick while sheetrock is only 1/2"". Electrical boxes will.need moved for this also. Tarp and duct tape the floor. Good luck."

"Are you sure that it's tight at the hinges? Doors in our house are very tall and very heavy, even interior doors, and they started to sag after about 6-7 years. Stripped the small screws that came with the hinges, they were only about 1.5"" and were holding a lot of weight! The holes were already pretty well stripped so I took all the hinges off both the door and wall and hammered in some golf tees (you could use small dowels, I just happened to have a huge bag of wooden tees) with a little wood glue. Let them dry, sawed off flush, and then drove in some 2.5-3"" screws to replace them. My daughter's bathroom door was the first about a year ago and it still opens perfectly. Have since fixed two other doors and all work great now. Have a few more to do... seems every door in the house has started sagging lately. "
"Good luck. This is a classic way of getting something you pay for to give you a return for a change. Insurances want and need to know about anything that reduces safety or value to your property. If I am a guest at your home and slip and bust my ass on your frozen pond of a yard I am going to sue you. This is a situation they want to avoid happening. In the summer if I am over there and get mosquito bitten to hell and wind up with one of the many diseases associated with that I will sue you. Same deal, different season. You need to make your insurance start working for you instead of just writing them a yearly check. In the end, your neighbor.needs to.get off their ass and fix a problem that has become yours. Good luck. Post results as they come in, many need to know what transpires in this type of situation."
"This is a reoccouring problem with all tankless heaters that nobody considers when installing one. MINIMUM WATER USAGE DEMANDS. Easiest fix would be to remove the shower head and remove all the water saver washers and reducers inside it at the supply end of it. Next would be to go buy a replacement shower head that is either not a water saver or one you can drill out or modify easily to increase the water output through it.  This is all too common, while every manufacturer of water dispensers has been mandated to make them more eco friendly by using less water tankless heater systems have not modified their basic operating system needs to match. Good luck. Just for shits and giggles, turn on the sink hot water while showering once and see if that let you adjust the shower temp normally. Would prove my theory."

"We've been here a little over a year and have a pretty good relationship with him. But although there was minor water damage to the area when we moved in, it's definitely gotten worse since then.

If we can rectify the situation without involving him and at reasonable effort or cost.

"Let's do the math here....    Random internet search tells me the average American flushes 5 times per day.    Another search tells me that a gallon of tap water costs about $0.004.    That means, that 0.3 gallons flushed costs about $0.0012    52 weeks in a year, let's say you flush 3x day M-F and 5x Saturday and Sunday, for a total of 25 flushes per week per person.    That 0.3 gallons over 1,300 flushes per year per person comes out to 390 gallons of water.  At $0.004 per gallon, that's about $1.56.    So strictly from a cost perspective, you'll save $1.5/year with the 1.3g toilet...  That said, that result is STRONGLY depending on the cost/gallon, and less so on the number of flushes.  If your tap water costs $0.01/gallon, then the extra 0.3 gallons over 25 flushes per week will cost you $3.90.    Mind you, the above numbers are for a single person, so if it is you and 2 other family members, triple all amounts.    From an economic perspective, the cost seems trivial.      From a ecological perspective, your toilet water and your tap water are potable and come from the same place.  Using 0.3 gallons less per flush, over 1,300 flushes equates to 390 gallons of water... which is well over what a single person needs per year to live.    Ecology is important to me, so I'd use the more efficient toilet.    But, you did mention having some health issues, and as I know someone with Crohn's, I understand.  Read the reviews and go with the one that can best handle your... output.  It'll save you time and hassle, and that has a value all its own."
"Are you moving plumbing fixtures around, like sinks?Are you moving built-in appliances around, like stoves or wall ovens?Are you changing the layout of the cabinets significantly?Here's my story, in case it helps:I'm about to start a major kitchen remodel project. I'm not DIYing it. It is a large kitchen with the following built-ins: 2 sinks, 2 dishwashers, beverage cooler, under-counter ice maker, 2 built-in fridges, cooktop, double wall oven, single wall oven, vent hood and warming drawer. It's a complicated space. Only a few of those items are actually going to be new, as what's there now isn't old enough to justify throwing away. I'm just buying a few missing pieces.The sinks aren't moving, so we're not moving any plumbing. The cabinet company can disconnect and reconnect the plumbing and they do not anticipate we'll need a real plumber. We've already bought new, gray quartz Elkay sinks. We haven't picked out faucets, yet.We will absolutely need an electrician, but everything that needs changed is in one wall. We have not quoted that yet.We will need a roofer to run the ductwork for the new range hood, since we're moving the cooktop and sealing off an old, non-functional down-draft venting system.We are replacing all the cabinetry, countertops and sinks. We're using granite countertops. and we are not changing the general footprint of the cabinetry very much. We're not changing the flooring. We're not knocking down any walls, but we are re-doing the tile backsplash to a style from this century.The total budget for all this is just under half what you've been quoted. I know flooring is a significant expense and maybe you need the whole kitchen stripped to the studs, re-wired and re-drywalled or maybe you need to re-do the subfloor due to water damage, but $100,000 sounds like a whole lot, unless your kitchen is 350 sq ft or something. I'm acting as my own GC for this project, because it's really just the cabinet people and electrician with some small other items on the side. You might not be able to do that with the complexity of your project."

"Find out how well the block was assembled and reinforced.  Some places, like California and southern Florida, require horizontal and vertical rebar steel every 1 foot and all the hollows of the blocks filled with grout,  while in most places the rebar is spaced every 4-6 feet vertically, usually closer horizontally, and the hollows without rebar are left empty.

"If your any bit handy, you may be able to replace more at once by doing it yourself. I just replaced a 2x6 cedar sill plate that i knew had a rot spot when I bought the house. I put off fixing it for a year and a half because I was daunted by the task and afraid of messing it up. I bought some wood hardener thinking I could just patch it but after I opened the rot spot, I found it just kept going. I tore half the board apart when I was done removing the rot and decided it would just be easier to replace it at that point. The orange big box store carries cedar in my area so a trip there and 4 hours later, it was fixed. In hindsight, I waited far too long out of fear of the unknown.You could also pay someone to do a portion and then decide if you can do it by watching them to build your confidence in the task."
"Kind of two separate questions:1. Does it need to cost $4000 to remedy this situation?2. Do I want to make an insurance claim for all/part of this?Not everything that you can get insurance to cover you should get insurance to cover. Especially homeowner's insurance. They are pretty aggressive with logging your strikes and dropping you if they think you or your house is likely to be a money sink for them. I'd keep the homeowner's insurance reserved for things that would be onerous for you to handle on your own.Which then brings you back to question 1. Is there a solution that's cheaper than $4000? It seems to me like paying $3000 to dehumidify a place that gets regular flooding is pointless. That money would be better spend re-grading your property so that it doesn't flood as often, but that's up to you."

"1. Probably not an easy job to rip up your floor. Iü__ll bet some of that sub flooring extends under the knee walls. Even so, if itü__s nailed down slat wood, youll damage it by removing it, making it hard to put back. 2. Your thinking is right. Right now that center part of the attic is like a heat chimney. The heat just goes up and right out the roof.  If you insulate the ceiling of the attic, you will slow the heat transmission and save energy. You should also insulate the backs of the knee walls if theyü__re not already. If you are insulating the underside of the roof, be sure to allow room for air circulation from the soffit vents all the way to the ridge vent. I would insulate both the underside of the roof behind the knee walls and in the center part of the attic. 3. If you can tolerate the loss of head room, do both. You are trying to get as close to R60 as you can. Fiberglass and foam will double your R value. This is a better option than ripping up your floor. Besides, under your floor, youü__d be limited there in how much insulation would fit too. "
"Thanks!! I watched a lot of videos, read a few articles, and asked around a bit. The only difficulty is that I didnü__t fully relate to all those videos online of people removing their grass as I had some hard compact dirt here in the desert. I also kinda made a personal leveling tool that I used for measuring the depth above the the sub base (I can share a pic if youü__re interested). I also made sure to take my time making sure I did all the prep work correctly and until I got into a groove.  Anyway, a few tips that seemed to help me or that I learned along the way:- it was nice buying all the components beforehand, such as pavers, edging, sand, maybe base, polymeric sand- excavate or dig out the site a few inches larger/wider than necessary (for edging and to mitigate piles of gravel tumbling, as in my case)- calibrate your level for the slope youü__re doing (usually 1 in / 8 ft, or 1/8th inch per foot). I just prepped one area to that slope and saw where the bubble on the level sat- make it close to flush with the concrete if laying alongside it- you can always put in or remove a little bit of sand if you notice after laying some that itü__s not even- make sure to space them at least 1/4 inch apart so polymeric sand can fill gapsAah I dunno I learned a lot so hmu if you have any more questions. :)"
"Alright in that case, cut a couple pieces of 2x4 to fit between the studs and ~~tow~~ toe screw them in. Pack some insulation back there (hardware store has [small project packs](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Owens-Corning-R-6-7-EcoTouch-PINK-Multi-Purpose-Small-Project-Unfaced-Fiberglasss-Insulation-Roll-16-in-x-48-in-A85P/100320315) for stuff like this... just pack it in good), and tack the PEX up with [these](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Apollo-1-2-in-PEX-Pipe-J-Hook-Pipe-Support-10-Pack-APXJH1210PK/301541116). Don't skimp on those hooks. Now on to drywall. Cut away a little more on the left side to expose more of that stud. Cut a piece of drywall (green board or the purple stuff if you can find a scrap... the big box stores have ""project panels"" for stuff like this) the same size as your opening, and measure to where you have your pipes secured and protruding. Strike a line across at that point on your new piece of drywall and cut. Then notch out for the pipes and fit your drywall into the opening in two pieces. Secure to the studs with drywall screws then tape and mud the seams, and mud around the pipes. Whether or not you wanna sand it smooth is up to you (it's under the sink, after all) but you should definitely prime over it to seal it. And that should handle it. I dunno why people are giving you grief about it. You asked for advice, not criticism on the quality (or lack thereof) of your plumber's work. Yeah, leaving it like that was lazy AF and improper. You know that as well as anyone... it's *your* house, after all. People just like to gripe, I guess."
"Good god, there's something about framing that always brings out the DIY assholes, isn't there? I think it's because it can be a *little* complicated, what with the span tables and rafter angles...so once you understand some of it, you feel like a genius, if you aren't a pro. I'm surprised that your roofer doesn't know how to fix this. As I said elsewhere in this thread, in support of another commenter who was being downvoted for no good reason; a competent roofing crew should definitely have people who know how to make simple carpentry and framing repairs like this. If this roofer has literally no idea how to make some rafter tail repairs, he's not a very smart person or hasn't been doing this trade very long.Now, let me ask you this--does (or did) your roof have any overhang at all? Were the rafters exposed or no? I suspect the answer is no to both of these questions, considering that the rafters seem to end with the exterior wall line. With little to no overhang or exposed rafter tails to consider, this should be a very easy repair. It doesn't need to look pretty, those rafters just need to be sistered, so that there will be some solid wood for the fascia board and the roof sheathing to be nailed into. Also, for the commenters who are complaining about the roof framing being less than beautiful (the over saw cut lines on the rafter seat cut); that's house framing for you. If you're throwing a fit about that, than you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. All house framing has shit like that, and it literally doesn't matter. This isn't cabinetry."

I think you have the right answer here. It's the closest to creating a true fix (making the wall square) without blowing out the entire wall the old tongue and groove stuff is fairly easy to remove as well. If I'm off an inch on one wall -- any ideas about how to transition that to drywall without redoing it?

"That's how I'd do it, cut out a rectangle same size as the mount and bolt it direct to the concrete.  That way you know you're flush to the wall, you don't have to worry about the condition of the furring strip between your mount and wall, and it'll even reduce the depth of the TV sticking off the wall a bit."
"The drain will need to be moved, the rest of the situation remains to be seen as the ""diagram"" doesn't show all the information needed. An actual photo of the area needs to be shown.

"There may be a compromise. You may be able to find an electrician to sign off on work that you (and the inexpensive guy) do.

Turn the breaker off. Pull washer out and check wiring. At plug and cord. Then check wiring the breaker panel. Make sure ground is making good connection. Be safe. Good luck. If youü__re not handy or have any experience then you may want to hire an electrician to check before you take the door off the panel. 
"Unfortunately, finding the right one is often the hardest part. I was somehow able to identify and find the one for my shower, but have been unable to remove the inner section.  It's stuck, and I'm a bit afraid to put any more pressure on it than I already have.  But it's not very hard to get to it, at least."
"Well I'm not a plant guy, I'm  a contractor, so I don't know much about the specifics of the crops themselves. But over 1/3 of the greenhouses we build don't get a furnace.

"With a one bed home, the potential buyers expect that some compromises must be made.  I would say to follow your contractor's lead, and if you decide that you want to stay there for many years, you can explore adding on to the place.  Then you could add a second bathroom and this would no longer be a problem."
"Yep, definitely okay. In fact, you'll see that's what those modular gang plates systems are designed for.You just don't want to run data and high voltage together.

the drywall repair will be extensive as well as the electrical if you paying to have this done.  J-Boxes will have to put in and all new wiring run if its even possible to access the old wires to pull them out and rewire to a j-box in the first place. The cost could easily surpass the cost of a new front door
"4"" hand scraper with 18"" handle, you can use snap off blades just fine in it. Knife strips in the vinyl, go smaller widths if you're struggling, you may well find it's able to just be pulled up without scraping but if it's really well stuck down then cut your widths at 2"" wide (or less if really needed) and use the scraper, it should peel it away.Source: This is my primary method for having done hundreds if not into the thousands of vinyl uplifts. It's rare that I require a floor stripper to uplift vinyl, even on large jobs (1k sqft+) it's often unnecessary."
"Clogged twice in how long?  Have you had the line TV'd by a plumber, or they just snake and leave?  I would get a video inspection done before you do anything to it, it may be possible to line rather than replace.If you're in groundwater, it will likely be a more extensive fix than just waterproofing.  Hell, you may not be able to fix this problem at all if the groundwater is that high, it may just be something you have to deal with in your area.  You could install a larger/stronger pump, but if it's just recirculating groundwater it will be a losing battle."
"I am a little further south, but I generally leave my thermostats set at 50 year-round (oil boiler with radiator and baseboard zones), and only increase them when it is getting too cold to be comfortable.

I would try to get long screws in at least one side, but a carefully placed blocker with liquid nail may help. Also, you can screw in a blocker horizontally under the wall studs that already exist as long you have an edge that sticks out enough to screw the floor into. Good luck !

"I just heaved them up with a wrecking bar and then patched the concrete. They don't go very deep, but they will take a pretty good surface divot out when you take them up.If you wanted to be delicate about it but not overly time-consuming I'd put a long fine-tooth metal cutting blade on a reciprocating saw and buzz it between the plate and the slab just cutting the nails. Then just leave the cut-off nails in the concrete (might need to file them flush). Still a chance that the sawzall will grab just right and rip it out of the concrete instead of cutting it."
"I live in PA so not sure if this a general inspector thing or not, but I had a guy come to inspect electrical that ran to a sunroom off the side of my house.

If I were you, i would run the electric and have it inspected, and dont worry about the egress or any other problems.  "
"I used these toggle bolt anchors to hang some Besta cabinets, which install with the same brackets as Knoxhult. If your drywall is in great shape (and your wall is completely straight and plumb across where these cabinets will be) and you don't ever intend to put anything heavy in these cabinets, these are easy and effective.My drywall was hiding some surprises, and if I knew then what I know now, I'd cut a hole in the drywall to install horizontal 2x4s between the studs so I could mount into that.

Never mow when it's wet, or even first thing in the morning when the dew is still on the grass. He also swears that cutting the grass higher and leaving the clippings lay is healthier for the grass. Also make sure your blades are nice and sharp.All of this may be bullshit but it seems to work for our yard. "
"Sorry about that, the hypothetical was 20a breaker, with 12ga all the way. The other person showed how 15a outlets can legally be installed on 20a circuits, and I was trying to process the implications of that. The plug shape would prevent any *single* 20a device from being plugged in and overloading the 15a receptacle, but it wouldn't prevent two 10a devices from being plugged in and drawing 20a through the 15a outlet. The other person mentioned that it's possible all 15a outlets are actually rated for 20a, so that could be the answer if that's the rule.

"well, to add to it. Paint has a way of getting where you don't want it. Dedicated painting clothes happen for a reason! You will want to put dropclothes down to protect floors, furniture, etc. But more you can clear the room, the easier it is.Painting is not hard. It is detailed, time consuming, fiddly work.

Bad prep with great paint will look like crap. This Old House has done some segments on painting, I recommend watching them on their website. They cover technique pretty well."

So you might find that insulation doesn't do much, but it's cheap enough that you might as well try.Don't worry about return temperature. Insulation will change it maybe a few degrees. You'll get more variation over different seasons.If the heat in the house is working, don't worry about pipe diameter. If you repipe it with pex then you should consider what size is correct. And don't worry about heat flow. Thinking of it as an amount of heat added to the room is fine, if that makes more sense to you. "

"I just paid for an earthquake retrofit in the seattle area.  The work itself isnt that hard if the structure is exposed.  But its dusty and youll need an expensive hammerdrill to put bolts into concrete.  You can see if there are any blanket plans available for the configuration of your house.  Or you can pay for engineering drawings and then do the work yourself.  The drawings ran me about 2k. And the total price of the retrofit was about 15k but my basement was finished and I had to have some extra reinforcement done to the concrete foundation.I just did some googling and it seems like just your garage door opening might need to be reinforces.  The solution for that is anything from some stronger plywood shear walls to custom steel reinforcement.  The plywood solution might be easier diy, steel not so much."
"With two backups already in place, I would let the primary run to failure. If you had no backups, I'd probably let the pump run to 15 years old before getting a replacement on hand. Depends on the current brand of your pump, though, and also on your comfort level of risk. If you have a high cost of failure (finished basement) then I'd spend the $150 to have a decent one ready to go, or even proactively replace the current one. I had a Zoeller in a previous house and it was a tank. At \~5 years old, the float switch got stuck on for a couple of days while I was out of town, so it was basically running dry/slurping water during that time. I replaced the float switch and it ran for another \~5 until I moved. Likely still there today (another \~5 years). I had a high water table and the pump ran every 5-10 minutes."
"So I'm a union mason contractor and I'm waiting on permits to build my garage. 36x24x15' 8""cmu garage with flat roof and 2 roll up doors. For 4' foundation and 4-6"" slab the concrete is going to be around 10-12k including labor and rentals. It will probably be higher for you because I'm doing a trench pour and I'm having my friend's crew doing it so 17k isn't crazy assuming 4' foundation with forms vs trench pour. My masonry (if I bid the work for a customer***) would be around 8k. Roofing is going to cost around 3-5k installed. My best friend is an electrician and we're coming in around 5k, but that also includes moving the meter to the garage and trenching lines from the street to the garage and from the garage to the house. Heater is going to be around 1400 installed. Your heater price seems high, is that the installed cost? Hopefully these numbers help a little at least. I know it's not super helpful because I'm not contracting out the work and you are. 75k seems pretty high honestly though especially if it's a non-union crew. I'd say get a couple more bids "
"[Telescopic coupling.](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Homewerks-Worldwide-3-4-in-PVC-Slide-Repair-Coupling-511-53-34-34H/206698171)Another option would be one of the 18"" flexible couplings. Those aren't any cheaper, but OP might trust it more than the o-rings in the telescoping one. Or make your own flexible coupling with black poly pipe and barbed fittings. I've found the clamp rings to be essential to those, though. So OP would want some stainless steel hose clamps or something to go along with it.I would honestly be tempted to use an epoxy putty stick to try to fix it before going through the hassle of more digging. If the pipe is clean and op packs the hole with epoxy then makes a ring around the pipe with the epoxy it'll probably hold for some time. I repaired a sprinkler valve with that stuff and it held for years until I replaced the valve for other reasons. Another redneck solution would be to cut a patch out of a larger PVC pipe and cement it over the hole. You'd want a heat gun and another section of pipe to size the patch to the curve of the pipe exactly, but PVC solvent cement is really really strong. If you cleaned and primed both pieces it'd probably hold as good as new. I'm not sure if it's any less work than the telescoping union, but if OP has a 1"" pipe and a heat gun on hand it'll be cheaper."
"The radiators in the hot rooms need smaller vents so they take longer to heat up, and/or the radiators in the cooler rooms need larger vents so they heat up more quickly. Some steam vents have a dial you can adjust [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Emerson-Swan-Angle-Steam-Adjustable/dp/B072R1RR46/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540834872&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=steam+vent+adjustable), others have a replaceable orifice [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DV3AGE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - I got two of them last year and in spite of their low price they work perfectly. If a vent is not adjustable you can replace it with another vent.Also, the *headers* in the upper floors may have undersized vents. My house has two headers. One is a short headers supplying 5 rooms, the other is a long header supplying 2 rooms. The rooms supplied by the long header took a long time to heat up, so I replaced the slower header's vent with [one of these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F26P13C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and it heats up much faster now. It cost me $75 if I remember correctly, but it was well worth it. It has much more venting capacity than anything with a similar price. One last thing: see the diagram here: https://www.gorton-valves.com/products In general you want small capacity vents for radiators near the boiler/with short pipe runs and large capacity vents further away/with longer pipe runs so the system vents all the radiators at about the same time. It's part experience and part trial and error. "

3400$ is a lot of money to paint 2 rooms and a hallway.
A good floor wax should work if you want fast and easy.
A long thin strip of plastic under the foot will do it.

Can you break down the budget a bit? Looks really good!
Care to elaborate? I am considering some smart switches
Cheap enough to replace before you live like the 1900s?

Have you thought about doing something less permanent? 
Hire a professional to teach you what you need to do.  
How are you going to level the stand if its on casters?
How big of a sub panel are you installing in your barn?
How old is the home? And is all the framing inside new?
Hrm. I've definitely.run out of advice. Best of luck!  
I can't figure out how to add a picture to this post...
I don't want light from that window. therefore useless.
I know right ? Who designs an L on the shower entrance?

I think 2ü_ù Tapcon screws in the flange should do it. 
I wasnü__t the one you responded to. Iü__m not married.
I'm curious as to where you get your timeline of 1930s?
If it can stick out from the wall a bit french-cleats? 
"If you can not help O.P., please do not respond at all."
Ill PM you. I dont know if I can say it on the thread. 
It looked like it could be an original Cecilia Gimenez.
It sounds like they require a shadowbox type design.   
It wont matter. I wouldn't use a nylon lock nut though!
"It's a single story, slab foundation, so no crawlspace."
It's also nice to control the lights without getting up
It's not a typical thing to do. Usually done as a scam!
Iü__d just replace the switch with a programmable one.

Thank you. I will go ask at the permit office directly 
Thank you. Iü__ll post there and see if someone knows. 
Thanks for the reply. What am I looking for underneath?
"Thanks, this is useful. Iü__m totally new at all this. "
Thanks. Iü__ll go grab a test piece and give it a try. 
That's code here. Same on the other end of the rafters.

"... wasI bet that if this house gets sold, the new owner will rip stuff out and repaint.  What a contrast now from what's on the outside compared to the inside... I find the exposed wood to be very 'warm'.  To each their own, I guess!!!  Only thing missing are whips and chains for the ~~sex dungeon~~bedroom."
"Before doing anything dramatic, check around to see what else isn't straight or level. To my eye it looks like the soffit isn't level or square with the wall on the right, but it could just be the photo. Rarely is anything perfect but you need to decide which part is the worst and what you want to do about it."
Buy a cheap ryobi table saw for $100 and sell it for $75 when youü__re finished or return it to Home Depot and claim that it doesnü__t meet your expectations or just keep for the next project. It will cost you you about $30-40 a day to rent one and if you buy it you can work at your own pace. Just my two cents
"Depends on the trade and area. Most trades will have dirrerent levels to them (e.g. apprentice, journeyman, master). Each level will have certain requirements for years on the job and possibly testing requirements. Most trades require a license, or to work under someone who is licensed with the local AHJ.   "

"Green board or purple board is what you want. Never use cement board as an exposed substrate. The other option i've used for tile backer is an uncoupling membrane.

"Hyvents, Air-Scoop/Scarf, and checking your expansion tank to ensure it's not waterlogged. Also, some manner of hanger bracket insulator/cushion.

"I have a 100' long fence here in the Oregon rainforest done just this way: posts in gravel. It is 10 years old and still perfectly solid. I am so confident of my fence, sure that it will last at least another 10 years, that I am just about to replace the rustic connecting boards, making it more modern-looking."
"I've thought about that, but I don't think the manufacturer of the siding recommends it, and I want to avoid kicking up any more silica dust than I need to. We're using masks and vacuuming up any debris with a shop vac and the right filter, but don't want to kick up more dust than necessary and have it spread."
If they were the cement board that was used in the yee old days then you should be aware they contain asbestos. You can tell by breaking a chunk and see if it contains what will appear to be fiberglass fibers. Thatü__s the asbestos so make sure you wear a respirator and tyvek suit and keep dust to a minimum.  
"If you can't seal the exterior of the foundation you can seal the interior.  Just coat the walls and floor with a waterproofing membrane.  Realize though that this will only keep the walls dry until the membrane fails.  It's addresses the symptom, but not the root cause which is predominately a drainage issue."
"Kind of random, but we got one of those Beville ""toaster ovens"" which is really a countertop convention oven and it is awesome. Nearly replaces the microwave, amazing at re-heating food and baking small to medium things. Oh and it makes *perfect* toast. If it broke I would replace it without a second thought. "
"Nice - thanks!  Advantage for me, Texas - no frost line. I got lucky with some interior electrical I had to do.

No I have been using the bit [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dremel-1-16-in-Carbide-Grout-Removal-Bit-569/202263182](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dremel-1-16-in-Carbide-Grout-Removal-Bit-569/202263182).

"No water damage that I ever remember, and my bed was right under that part of the ceiling for nearly all of my life.

"OK.

"People read it and believe it. Downvoting the bad advice doesn't work because people can't figure out what the bad advice is.

"Pretty blurry, but all look threaded to me, except the end of the flex line, which Iü__m guessing is not fully tightened.

"That's some sort of fiber or sawdust panel (mdf, particle board, hardboard). You could score it with a sharp knife above the damage, break it off, install a new piece of the same thickness, spackle, and paint.

"Ugh, yeah. That's what I am afraid of.

"What are you looking for?  Covering with stone is aesthetic, are the doors staying?  If you have any interest in a practical fireplace, leaving the doors and heatilator will help pump out a bunch of heat.  Maybe you can work the vents into your design.  If all you want is heat, then an insert is the way to go."
Yep. There i basically no difference between natural gas and propane. If you can buy something for natural gas furnaces then its available for propane. All propane furnaces have thermostats. You can buy a programable one even to set time of day for your furnace to run and elect the temps you want it to run at.
"You're not being picky, that alignment is really crappy.  Granted, no wall is complete straight or plumb, but a good tile setter will be able to hide defects better than someone who doesn't know what they're doing.  It doesn't look like this person knew what they were doing.  God know what else they got wrong."
"yeah, that's just because the cable installers were lazy. I must have pulled 20 different lines off my house before i repainted. I ran them all internally except for 1 cable supply line. It looks so much cleaner and is waay better. And it really wasn't very hard or expensive to do myself. Wire and a fishtape. "
"Also, your tip on the Stanley knife was good, thanks for that. In some places the grout saw worked better, but there were others where the Stanley knife was much more effective, especially where the grout and tile had started growing mold where they met. Based on the consistency, it seemed more like an 80%/20% grout/caulk mix in some places, and there the Stanley knife was great. In other places it seemed much more like pure grout and the saw worked better. The Stanley knife was also helpful cleaning off tile after letting the grout saw do the bulk of the work."
"Be there the first day when they start, ask to do an initial walk-through with the whole team to ensure colors are going in the appropriate rooms and that everything you wanted painted is on the checklist and the colors are correct, then just offer to buy them lunch and give them a number with any questions (tell them you're 10 minutes away and if they have any questions to please contact you).Once you're all on the same page let them do their thing. Initial walk-through is really the only ""micro-manage-y"" thing you need to do, and that's a standard procedure"
"Head over to [Hearth.com](https://Hearth.com) plenty of those boys installed their own liners, but they're paying a bit more than $150. There is a little bit of math involved, making sure you're sized appropriately and that your heights and tolerances are right, but its not rocket surgery, you can figure out it our on your own. I was fortunate, I have a good chimney guy who was able to clear mine so I don't need to replace it (prior owner had multiple fires) but if I did, I would probably do it myself, though it would likely cost closer to $1,000  than $150. "
"I'm just saying, on the cheap end I built a similar garage for like $3000 in building materials; that was walls, siding, roof, windows, doors, garage door and any hardware. Getting to $15,000 is a huge jump. Odds are the frame isn't going to be too different, same amount of wood. If he goes high-end on roofing materials and siding, doors and windows I can see a jump. But $12,000?I've dry-walled and dry wall is what, $10 per 8x4? Insulation is a different item. I'm not saying my garage is identical, I'm saying mine was a fraction, and I still have a garage."
"It's mildew.  Very common in bathrooms that aren't vented properly.  As u/macimom said, the landlord should have it cleaned by a pro before you move in.  However, if he doesn't and you can't find another place to live, it is simple to fix yourself.  Just a bit tedious.  Scrub off what you can with vinegar.  Then prime with Zinsser mold killing primer and then paint the topcoat of whatever color you want.  To prevent future mildew buildup keep the bathroom well ventilated.  And clean it at first signs of mildew, it should have never been allowed to get that bad."
"Iü__m not sure how you got the inpression I was just going to start hacking away and see what sticks. This is what Iü__m doing right now. Asking questions and watching a lot of YouTube. As I mentioned in my post and in several comments my neighbor helping me used to be a professional tiler. Only reason Iü__m not paying him to do it is cause his back canü__t handle it anymore. So Iü__m paying for his knowledge. As far as plumbing I worked as a apprentice plumber for 6 months so working with basic stuff isnü__t to hard more me. Iü__ve just never tiled before.  "
"The other suggestions are good, but if it were me I'd probably just use joint compound or spackle for both the wall and the baseboard.  It may take some precision spreading and filling to get the baseboard just right, but it's probably your lowest cost option.  Use a wide putty knife and a smaller one for the baseboard. Once you get the shape right, sand it as needed and then paint match.  Since you've already told your landlord about the issue, maybe you can ask them if they have some of the original paint for you to use.  If not, just ask them what they used."
"This is what the CDC has to say about mold: https://www.cdc.gov/mold/faqs.htmBasically, all molds create different spores. If you are allergic to those spores, you will have a bad time. Iü__m highly allergic to aspergillosis but have only mild reactions to other molds. It depends on your own biology. Most bathroom mold issues are easily solved with bleach but that is *a lot* of mold. My throat itches just looking at that picture. I would not rent the unit until the mold is handled. Landlords are responsible for providing safe and healthy housing. Good luck!"
"Yeah, it makes sense it's on a circuit. But the PROBLEM could be something ELSE on the circuit. In my circumstance our bedroom lights were flicking and not working. It ended up being an electrical outlet in the LAUNDRY room. But they were on the same circuit.Map out everything on that circuit. Lots of way to do that - but you can shut off the breaker and then just check everything that is off. An no contact electrical tester pen can be super handy here and they're pretty cheap. Again - I'd bet something in that circuit is loose, or working its way loose. "
"You can drain two sinks into one wall drain. So if the drain is already there, it'll be fairly easy. It's common to have two sinks feed to the same P trap and then to the wall drain. Supply lines can T after the shut off valve.Cutting open the wall will be more related to the height of the drain vs the height of your new vanity. But if the rough-in is standard it shouldn't be an issue.But even then, opening up the wall isn't a huge deal.The only way to know what a plumber would charge would be to get bids. But it should be a small project for any plumber."
"You can get tile snap cutters in the range of 48"". Pick up a good branded one and make sure the scribe wheel is in good condition. ymmv with some lesser brands though.Dry cutting with an angle grinder and a diamond blade is another alternative. Do it outside with a respirator on, of course.Fwiw, cuts in a kitchen are at edges/cabinetry and don't have to be absolutely perfect as you can caulk anyway (edit: and you're looking at quarter round apparently anyway which typically goes much wider than any caulk bead I've seen anyone ever use as a finishing touch)."
"You should do the layout on the ikea website. It basically spits out a bill of materials based on your design.1. It just sits between base cabinets2. Most people get the fronts from IKEA as well. They have a many different styles in colors and finishes.3. I'm sure you could paint the cabinets (boxes), but most do people definitely do not.4. Their drawers are called MAXIMERA. They come with the drawers and slide, and you configure your fronts to match your needs. 5. Sink space requires the SEKTION Sink Base Cabinet (you can choose cabinet doors or drawers)"
"we had several years of heavy garter snake infestation near and around our house.  Took a while to revamp the landscapiong and get ivy off and away for the house.  Small garter snakes (6-10in) would go up the ivy and underneath some areas of the sill plate (house built in 1927).  One season our cats caught 10 of these guys inside our house in the basement.  The worse is when they would bring up a dead one or nearly dead one and lay it on our bed and my arm would brush it, A real wake call at 2am in the morning. In past 10 years, perhaps one snake has gotten in."
"PEX has more than a 50 year history. It's been in use since the 60s. It's a time tested product at this point. It offers a greater warranty than copper. It's less expensive.I work with primary copper and brass on my side of things. PEX's lack of rigidity and joint length requirements make it less than ideal for manifolds. I prefer the visible elegance of copper. That said there is nothing functionally wrong with PEX and many arguments against it are simply fear mongering.The OP is asking specifically about stub outs. It's assumed they are plumbing the house in PEX already. There is a choice to be made as to whether they should come out of the wall with copper or just come out with PEX.I prefer copper stub outs that have been firmly clamped inside the wall. It looks nicer and I find are easier to work with."
"Why not go with double wall ovens and 36 or 48"" range top? You'll lose 12-24"" less countertop space and gain some extra cabinet space, both of which I would rather have as a potential future buyer.  Double wall ovens can be placed at a height that is actually comfortable to use and can be placed out of the main use walkways to prevent traffic congestion when doors are open. If you bake enough to need/desire two full size ovens, then ergonomics and ease of use should factor into your choice.   If you don't mind replacing both ranges when one quits, then I don't see any other major financial pitfalls.  How big is your kitchen going to be that it can aesthetically support 60"" of range? Generally smaller kitchens with better flow are more conducive to cooking/baking than a stadium kitchen.   &amp;#x200B;"
"Yeah, you should be worried. Check it at a few intervals. Some things can cause the water to run unattended. A water softener would cycle every so often. An ice maker runs every few hours.It could be a leak somewhere in the lines outside--the sprinklers or the supply line running into your house.If you have shutoff valves that are specific to areas of the house--e.g. a shutoff for the sprinklers or one for the house itself--try turning them off one at a time to see if the meter stops moving. That will at least tell you what general area the issue is in. You can turn off known automated stuff like the ice maker while you do this test just so it doesn't come on and mess you up.  (The ice maker should come on for like 5 seconds a few times a day, so it's a long shot that it would actually throw off your tests.)"
"Ah, yeah ok that makes more sense. I'm only now noticing the part where you said they're all 24 OC (24 inches apart, on center). That makes a typical mount installation more difficult, regardless of the material.Like I mentioned in another post, it's not that the strips are ""holding up"" the TV, per se. It's that if you drill into the concrete from the wall where there's an air gap, you risk collapsing the wall when you tighten down the bolts.Someone rec'd toggle bolts. But the problem there is, the size you'd need to safely hang a TV probably won't have enough room to expand behind the wall. You'll stick it in and it'll hit the concrete before the wings clear the drywall and flare out.I've heard of one solution where you cut down down 1/2"" PVC to act as a sleeve around the bolt. It sits flush with the drywall and against the concrete, acting as a stand off. Pretty clever, but I've never tried it.If it were I, I'd probably just remove a section of the drywall, and tapcon some 2x4 scraps directly to the concrete, then mount to that.

"I've found that a drywall saw/cheap serrated knife is actually pretty good for this too, depending on thickness of the sod. I think you can do it in 3 days. i think the prep of the old stuff and hauling/leveling new dirt is the hardest part. i'd actually be inclined to start your dirt prep friday night, soil saturday and then sod sunday. it's kind of stressful if you've got sod getting delivered and your ground isn't ready, because it has a limited shelf life on the pallet. try to have a cool place to store it and spray with the hose if you're not ready, but avoid throwing a tarp over the sod as it will cook it. you might want to have a roto tiller on hand in case you need to break up the existing yard a bit more. you should also get as large of a landscaping rake as you can fit in your car; leveling off a yard is really frustrating work and it helps to have a rake that covers a large area.once your prep work is done, the sod really flies assuming it's not too many challenging cuts. make sure to do a brick pattern, really marry the joints and water well.

"Iü__m in the Bay Area so take that for what itü__s worth.I did a complete kitchen remodel last year that involves relocating the kitchen, gutted down to the floor joists, all new electrical, plumbing, gas, relocating a sliding glass door and a window, etc. New appliances, ikea cabinets, quartz counters. I did all of the work except the plumbing myself and spent about 40k on the full remodel. (Album here: https://imgur.com/a/cuLmO)I just (last week) finished a master bathroom remodel where we did a 25 square foot addition to the house to extend the closet, some plumbing and electrical movement, heated floors, massive shower and separate tub, etc. We went high end on the finishings and paid to have the work done this time around. Total cost was just over 41k (album here: https://imgur.com/gallery/hBlGPNO)Labor is expensive. I had rough quotes on my kitchen that would have put it at 100-130k had I paid to have it done. Iü__m not shocked to see you get a 100k but again, Iü__m inter Bay Area and money isnü__t worth nearly as much here as it is most other places."
"Set up Craigslist alerts for all of the tools you will only use occasionally and see what deals you can find. I have tons of tools that don't get much use, so I try to buy used whenever I can.My favorite shop I ever visited/worked in had a compressor in a corner and two air hoses on pull down reels over the big central work table. One always had a blower attached so you could quickly clear the dust from projects, the other would be used for nailers, etc. Unless there's some special reason for battery powered nailers, I would go with air tools. Cheaper, and then you get a compressor for other projects. Not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but a couple of years ago I picked up two of these [folding metal sawhorses ](https://www.homedepot.com/p/TOUGHBUILT-Adjustable-Height-25-32-in-and-Width-39-9-45-9-in-Steel-Sawhorse-and-Jobsite-Table-1300-lb-Capacity-TB-C700/205870356)with 2x4 slots at home depot and I love them.

"This is the correct answer. I have a brick house and have mounted several things, including TVs, on our exterior walls.

"I second the ceramic radiator panel heater idea.  Less risk of fire for above a garage since there is no flame and they do a nice job heating.

Never seen it done, but you could strip some insulation off some number ten() size solid wire and use it as a sleeve over the bad spot.  Never seen heat shrink used, but that might be OK.

The concrete is acting as a giant heat sink. If it is a post and beam subfloor with a crawl space, insulating those stud bays will help. Tearing out walls for insulation is really the only way to guarantee a good job is done. Can also add vapor barrier at this time. I believe in your area itü__s best to have it just under sheetrock - check codes. Donü__t forget to insulate the attic space as well. Heat rises. "
Most places won't fill your tank if they've determined you need a replacement. Will your old company continue filling it? I'd call them and ask them to check the tank. If they say the same thing just get a new one. If it really is original from the 60s that thing could probably fail at any moment. A failed tank will haunt you for a lot longer than the few months you want to wait to install a new one. My neighbors tank failed 20 years ago and they are still suffering from it financially. Oil cleanup and soil contamination is something you don't want to deal with.
"No, it's not too bad. The municipality you live in regulates how properties need to be graded and where surface runoff needs to be directed. They are likely required to have a swale on the downhill side of \*their\* yard. If the city is unresponsive, call a lawyer.In the meantime, the most effective and most economical solution would be to install a french drain and/or pile heavy clay soil against the property line. I wouldn't go through the process of constructing any expensive walls unless you determine that you have no practical recourse with the neighbour."
"Personally, I would, yes. I would have loved it if our house had updated bathrooms and kitchen, even if they didn't totally fit our style tastes, it would have saved us a lot of money on replacing rotting floor, water damage, leaking pipes, and cracking ceramic fixtures if it had already been redone, heh. I would assume that most homeowners can only afford to drop the cash on renovation when there are practical purposes for it, not just dropping thousands of dollars to change something that you're not a fan of. I think the perspective depends on financial class."
"That is a conundrum! Itü__s a lot of squares and rectangles in there so I would do an oval like this.https://www.lampsplus.com/sfp/58M77/?cm_mmc=GOM-SH-_-NA-_-NA-_-58M77&amp;sourceid=DFGPM58M77&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIz8WH7P6L3gIVQ7nACh209gPZEAQYDyABEgI91PD_BwENow the problem will be finding right size. You could also do a rectangle that was as high as the window, that might make it look purposeful. I would look for a rectangle that filled as much space above sink as possible. But weirdly if I did an oval I would want it smaller. Perhaps that is no help._˘Æ_˘Æ"
"This isn't unusual for fiber cement siding (or really, ANY siding, but fiber cement in particular). However, the installer should have flashed behind the butt joints with some sort of metal flashing in the first place, instead of caulk. Trying to fight the expansion and contraction with caulk will never work. There are companies that actually make [pre-bent flashing](https://www.amazon.com/ProLine-Flashing-aluminum-butt-joint-flashing/dp/B00JN984UC?th=1) just for this purpose. The flashing is dark colored so it doesn't pop out as much when the siding contracts. "
"This scenario is a classic scam unfortunately. My husband worked on a farm where some guys came by with exactly this same sales pitch. They did a terrible job, demanded more money than they quoted, settled for 25% of their requested price (because what organic farm can spend that much on repaving their entrance road?), and the paving job quickly broke up in just one season. Edit to link to a news story about this scam: https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/group-warning-homeowners-of-asphalt-scammers/article_4ac3a310-a1df-11e8-8d38-10604b9f6eda.html"
"We had good luck with Gonzo solid air fresheners in a house that smelled so badly of pee that it was in your gums when you left. (100 percent fine now after a bunch of those and new floors) Theyü__re in a little Vaseline like tub and have just a solid lump in them (not the one with beads) and you can get them at Loweü__s. We got a great many and put them all over, and eventually everything normalized. We didnü__t have to use an ozone machine. The floors did a ton of the work, but those guys really helped. Weü__ve also used them in a former hoarder rental house. "
"1) Removing the windows, framing the openings smaller, installing new windows, and then correcting the damage both interiorly and exteriorly is going to run you several thousands of dollars. Figure about $1000 in materials alone and then probably $4-5k in labor. Just a ballpark, I don't know Boston's market. I would not recommend it. Get window shades (even smart ones that open/close at certain times of day) or valances which will block out part of the window at all times.2) This project is going to be so expensive you're probably better off buying a different house. As others have said, so many variables such as whether there is electrical or plumbing up there. You're going to need a structural engineer, roofer, electrician, etc. My ballpark guess is somewhere like $25k. All for a few extra feet? Not worth it."
"Ex-employee here. Official policy for Oops paint (at least at our store at the time) was to process the markdown, add a shot of tint and shake so it differed from the original mistake color and put it on the shelf. Once it's on the shelf it's sold as-is. That being said if you go an hour before closing time and see a college aged kid behind the counter, there's a better chance you'll get your way. Otherwise if you have any empty sample paint cans laying around take that in and ask for 8oz of black tint. Or something else with a trustworthy lid. Might seem like an odd request but to my knowledge there's nothing explicitly forbidden. You can dump that in your 5gal and they should shake it up for you. I've also had times where after the customer paid for the oops paint I could change it. Depends on the supervisor."
"I'd go over every nook and cranny of the house, looking for any crawl spaces, access panels, small closets or nooks, etc. When cable techs do installs, they're going to use whatever is available to them before busting open walls. So there might be an abandoned splitter somewhere. Maybe outside. It's rare for coax to just fail over time, unless it's physically damaged.Now, if there were renovations to this house in the past, it's totally possible that the builders either cut or disconnected those lines in a spot no longer accessible. That's what happened here. I was fishing wire thru my finished basement (which the previous owners did), and found a huge coil of disconnected coax wedged behind the stairwell, above a new bathroom. They basically framed around it and it's never coming out, unless I start demoing."
"Not a sparky, ~~but pretty sure this is not code and very unsafe~~.The stove is 120/240, which means it needs both (240 for heating elements, 120 for controls/display). The wiring you have is standard 2-wire (black and white) with ground, but wired for 240. Which, by itself isn't a problem, but the only way to *also* provide 120 is to use the ground as a neutral, which is dangerous. The ground path should not be energized except during faults.http://forums.mikeholt.com/showthread.php?t=88994~~That wiring needs to be replaced with 3 wire with ground~~.EDIT: After further reading, it looks like maybe this is still allowed by code, so long as no major renovations are happening, and the wiring isn't being moved. Newer ranges just have to be fitted with appropriate 3-wire cords. Again, I'm not an electchicken."
"That's the older style, I had a lot of trouble finding a replacement for mine - I ended up replacing the whole valve.You should also know that for single pipe steam, that valve is a service valve not a control valve. It's either all the way open or it's all the way shut. Never in between. Since this is an apartment, if you want to open or close it, just use a pair of pliers. DO NOT OIL TO LUBE if it's stuck. If you want control over how hot or cold the radiator gets, you need to replace the air vent with a smaller size if you want the room cooler, or a larger one if you want it warmer. Or, I don't typically recommend these but get a thermostatic radiator valve, that should give you some level of control over how warm the rad gets, unless your building runs steam over 3 psi, in which case you're out of luck."
"Wow. Big mirror. And by my calculations, 130lbs is wayyyyyy light. I would say 250-270lbs. They way I would do it, is get a glass cutter (any hardware store carries them), and start at the top corner, and cut a diagonal triangle out of the corner. Then if you can get a small pry bar behind to stress the cut, you will have a small piece to begin taking out. Take your time, and cut it out small piece by piece. Maybe 1sq ft at a time. This will allow you to pull it away from the wall easier, less small shards everywhere, safer work space, etc. If you are having trouble with the adhesive, find some type of a long blades knife. Iü__d donü__t know if you know what a windshield saw zaw blade looks like, but something like that. That way if you can ü__pullü_ù the glass free from the wall, you can cut it. Good luck!"
"Yeah mine's not in front of a stove - it's in a kitchenette which is basically a kitchen without built in appliances. The splash runs the entire length of the bench top. To save on cutting too many holes I installed 4 outlet fittings instead of the standard 2 outlet ones. I cut the holes myself once I had the splash back home. Measured up where they needed to go and cut through the stainless with a dremil cut off wheel and peeled off the cut out plates before cutting through the ply. I'm in Australia where we don't use boxes for the outlets like in the US - we just have wall clips that hold onto the hole cut in the plaster board and then clamp tight with the electrical fitting when you screw it in. But with the stainless and ply it gave something solid to screw the fittings to without the need for the clips. "
"One more quick story. I used to live in a city just outside of Chicago. Before listing your house for sale, you were required to have a pre-sale inspection done by the city, and any apparent code violations either had to be fixed before you could sell the place, or the buyer would have to sign an affidavit stating that they would fix them within 30 days after closing. There was only one guy who did these inspections. So hypothetically if you tried to flip a house here and you didnü__t pull permits, this guy is going to notice that the whole place has been renovated since he last walked through it six months ago and youü__re going to get busted. Or even if you bought a fixer upper and did your own renovations while living there over the course of a couple years...busted. In addition, they would not issue electrical permits to the homeowner unless you passed a written test that demonstrated your understanding of electrical code requirements. Compared to my other comment, this locality takes it to the other extreme. So yes, very highly dependent on location. "
"I'm no indoor air quality expert but based on [this](https://ohsonline.com/articles/2016/04/01/carbon-dioxide-detection-and-indoor-air-quality-control.aspx) website your CO2 levels are only slightly above normal. I wouldn't do anything drastic unless you feel the levels are effecting your health. Here are some cheap things you could do to slightly lower the CO2 levels:1. Open windows more frequently. 2. Add a fresh air intake in your basement. This is a simple duct (often flex) that connects to the outside and has a trap at the bottom to keep cold air from pouring in in the winter. This would supply make up air for your kitchen hood or if you have a draft vent gas water heater. In fact I would very highly recommend it for safety reasons if you do have a natural draft gas water heater as it can help it prevent back drafting. 3. Never use your ventless fireplace. They are illegal in some areas and IMHO should be banned. I doubt it's the source of your air quality problems but I would make a plan to scrap it. 4. Get a smart thermostat that you can set to run the fan on your furnace periodically. I believe the [ecobee 3](https://www.amazon.com/ecobee3-Thermostat-Sensor-Wi-Fi-Generation/dp/B00ZIRV39M/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540864978&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=ecobee+3) does this but the nest thermostat may also. This will stir up the air in your house and help with the elevated CO2 levels particularly in closed bedrooms. If all of the above don't work the device you're looking for to add fresh air to your home is called a [Heat Recover Ventilator (HRV.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_ventilation) Basically it's an air exchanger that pipes fresh air into your home while minimizing heat loss or gain. You should be able to get one with or have an inline hepa filter as part of the system. You're looking likly looking at $500-1000 for the HRV and 1-3K+ for installation depending on your local prices and how difficult it will be to retrofit this onto your system. If you go this route I'd recommend getting several quotes from local HVAC companies. "
