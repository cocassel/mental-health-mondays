"[This always comes in mind when I think of strict Asian parents.](http://torontolife.com/city/crime/jennifer-pan-revenge/) That approach is way extreme though, and I'm 95% sure you're better than that.At the end of the day though, you are their kid. They're not intentionally malicious, and they probably have your best interests in mind, even if they have a... different way of executing their concern. And if not (god forbid), well, you're still your own person. Honest, effective communication and persistence and maybe you'll all either come to some level of acceptance or simply agree to disagree. Indefinite time off would be nice for some relief, but ultimately good communication leaves a better taste than holding a grudge and severing ties with the family."
"From my (second-hand) experience, going to the doctor is one of the best things to do. I wouldn't know what to say or how to schedule an appointment, but I've heard from many people that going to the doctor and talking about their problems helped them a ton."
"I'm stuck. When you are faced with what you know you should do for your own good vs. what you want to do, what do you do? I'm battling time and I need to make a decision fast, but I just can't seem to pick the right one. I want to take time off this summer and go back home to be with family, but I have got a part time job offer here that I could take up and make some income. I know I could do it if I just put up with it. But living alone away from family has really been bringing constant depression for the past few months, and to add to that I really don't want to go on another academic term. I'm feeling so burnt out and lost as to what to do, and this is constantly brought up in my mind that I can't even concentrate on studying without my mind wandering off.."
Meh

Yup

"Had countless number of counselling visits, doctor appointments, friends and family support, but my pain is too much. Too much for what? I am not sure. I know for one that I am not going to live this life for long, and there are few ways this might pan out."
"UW Counselling services were pretty good from my experience and they would be able to point you in the right direction. From my experience, they never doubted my thoughts and were always comforting. That being said, it does take a while to get an appointment."
"Basically yea. We live for porn, vidya and memes now. Well, not me. But I used to. I realized I was looking at things the wrong way when I read Nietzsche's *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* where he says;&gt; Ask not what you are free *from*, but what you are free *for*i.e: make your own purpose in life, or you will forever feel this way. It's how men are. We need a purpose. It's why you see so many young men clinging fanatically to politics or videogames etc. It's just something to identify with and fight for."
"Winter term was my last term but I couldn't write one of my exams due to extreme anxiety (I threw up three times in front of the Doctor). So, I'm writing the makeup exam this Friday. Thankfully, if I pass this exam I'll still be able to graduate in June. I'm still a couple years late graduating due to mental health issues and I have to keep reminding myself that I did the best I could. It took me a long time to teach myself to value my health over everything and I still have to repeat that to myself everyday. "

"Haven't met anyone that i talk to outside of class because i'm living off res, but yeah I'm definitely gonna start going to office hours, thanks :]I'm just worried because i don't know what questions to ask, apart from ""I don't get how to do this question"""
"I'm that guy, and it gets tiring. People come to you asking for advice because you can look at it logically. And they're right, except make sure sometimes you talk to someone too. It gets exhausting just dishing out advice, and not having anyone listen to you."
i'm really sick and allergies are kicking my ass this hell week but this is the first term where i don't feel like my self worth is tied to my marks or my co-ops but just how much effort i put in and that makes this term infinitely better for my mental health 
"you should smoke indica or indica dominant hybrids for the calm relaxation high. If you want to have energy with possibility of paranoia and anxiety, you smoke sativa. It's hard to get the strain you need when the dealers dont even know what they are selling. "
"I was a mess in first and second year. Locked in my room 24/7, barely passing courses (failed a few), no friends, avoided all human contact.Look at me now bitches:* I enjoy going to class and learning* About to graduate with CS degree* Job lined up in Toronto with big salary* Kickass 1 bedroom apartment in Toronto with a city view* Amazing girlfriend who's really sweet and wants to have sex all the time* Not even taking meds anymoreNever lose hope fellas. Talk to counsellors, don't be afraid of meds."
"I haven't heard back from the dream job I interviewed for last Wednesday. They contacted me outside of jobmine and they were generally really fast. Guess I got rejected. I have already bombed 2 other interviews. I don't know how to do technical interviews. People say hackerrank and CTCI but I don't know how anyone can have the time to do those on top of schoolwork. 3 more interviews this week and I'm already feeling like I'm not gonna get any job. Hearing someone interviewing for the same position telling me how much coding practice they've done doesn't help either.Every night when I fall asleep I have bad dreams about being rejected from jobs, sitting in a midterm and unable to do anything, or being required to withdraw from school. When I wake up, I face the reality of being behind in all my courses, as well as my inability to do interviews. I am not good at anything. I fail at everything, whereas people around me get shiny marks and shiny jobs.Sometimes I just want to disappear. Life is such a struggle. "

"I have a pretty solid routine of going to co-op, then going to the gym, then working on side projects (coding, music) but I still feel really empty. I'm getting a psych eval soon because I feel so fucking useless and sad all the time, so I hope that'll be good."
"There's some pretty good MATH 239 notes online that I found when I took the course in Fall 2015: * [Liam Horne](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snario/course_notes/master/math239/math239.pdf)* [Chris Thomson](http://notes.cthomson.ca/dl/latest/math239.pdf)"
"Listen buddy, I get it. I know exactly what you're feeling because I was there too. Confidence or a lack thereof radiates out from a person whether they want it to or not. This affects romance, personal friendships, everything. But *nothing* will ever change until you stand up for yourself and make yourself better. Don't just lie on your back and let your demons and the world beat you to a pulp. Take your ""friends"" like that, kick their asses to the curb, and start the process of being happy in your own skin.

"Fuck the stress of getting a high enough average to transfer into co-op is getting to me. I feel like if I fail, my entire uni experience would go to shit.Bad enough that I'm having a hard time adjusting to the uni environment but now I gotta get 90s too? Fml."
I always look at it like just get as many marks as you can so that it's easier next time. It's really easy to not try and give up if you know you'll do badly. So you have to tell yourself to try and get as many marks as you can and you will do better next time. 
"I know that the idea of death seems like elusion from your problems, but please don't think that way. I know that I'm just some random person and I have no idea what you're going through, but I beg of you to try to live.If you ever need to talk, just PM me :) "
"Studying with classmates is a generally recommended strategy, but for me it just adds another layer of undue anxiety. But I don't always have the self-discipline required to work alone.Anybody^not^in^my^class^or^actually^idontcareanymore want to study with me?"
"Just because someone has worse times doesn't mean your life isn't hard either.Just because you are not in science/engineering doesnt mean you dont have a right to be scared/exhausted from school. People chose to be in their respective programs. You chose to be in yours. To you science/math may seem hard but trust me, someone else (like me) would gladly do science/math over literature/essay any day. I would rather write a 4 page lab report than a 2 page essay.Take life one step at a time. I am rooting for you"

I'm in AFM... I don't think there's anything about my courses that I love except that some of them have a logic to them that I like. I know that I like working with people. I don't like my program but I also don't know what to switch into... don't know what to do.
"It's not the poor assignment mark. It's the poor assignment mark + the other assignment marks + the midterm marks + the exam marks + the other courses + .......I reached the end of the tunnel, but until then it was a pretty dark passage from frosh to graduation."
"Unfortunately, they don't take too kindly to sexists that [pretend to be women](https://np.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/49l4lh/an_open_letter_to_the_first_years/d0suabx) in order to add verity to their view that women in CS are all unskilled diversity hires.  "

"Hang in there everyone. You are working towards a degree from a highly respected University. I've been in the workforce for 5 years and can't tell you how many times my UW degree has impressed a recruiter/employer. So, keep up the hard work and it will all pay off!"
I'm in a co-op only program and missed my first placement. I'm already two years in so I've invested a lot time/money wise and would rather not switch. But what ate the chances I actually get a job next  round now that I'm behind in experience compared to my peers?

"Book doctor appointment, convince doctor you need counseling, get counselling. Otherwise, go through Mental Health Services and convince them over the phone.Their groups seminars are also excellent resources and can help prevent the need for one on one counseling."
"I have an appointment with counselling set up a little while away but if it gets a lot worse, I can try to move it forward. I'm not too into the idea of medical marijuana, but thanks for the suggestion anyway! Hopefully I'll be able to fall asleep without it for now"
"So its the month where I  scheduled a day about a year back where I am to reflect on the year, where I was, and where I am now, and make a decision about the value of my own life. And the correct choice seems to be to refuse treatment for whatever happens Wednesday."
"sorry to hear that mate, but I don't think I'm properly mentally ill like (you claim) you are.in my case I don't really feel any effect on my actual life, but it's just a constant thought on my mind for some reason, so it's different from what you're experiencing."

"False, it's closer to half my life expectancy. I'm already doing everything I can that I can think of. Two year wait list for the ideal treatment (not offered on campus). Already seeing someone at CServices, already seeing a psychiatrist, already on other wait lists."
"That's nice and all but NSERC funding is only for students with averages higher than 72, according to that link... mine is just under, and will most likely be getting lower thanks to Chem 266... And an unpaid position isn't really an option for me... thanks though..."
"Whatever story you need to tell yourself to put the pen on the paper man. Some people are doing it for their family. Others create stories where they're always on the verge of failing. Some convince themselves academic success will get them better jobs ... whatever.You need to figure how to make yourself work, a lot. There's sadly not enough place for you to feel emotionally motivated to do your work. It sucks, and destroys a lot of people .... honestly the reason we have this thread every week.

"Mmm I've been through eating disorders before and I can say that it isn't an eating disorder. I'm not trying to lose weight either.I can see that I'm kind of skin and bones, but I do try and eat a normal amount. I do get pretty nauseous if I try to eat more, though. "
"Nothing, that is what you do in this scenario. You have to let people figure out the world on their own, it's good and bad. And everyone views it slightly differently after understanding it (some focus on good, the other on bad) so there is nothing you could do anyway"
"Yes, that being said it is higher than average, where average for assignments is generally above 90 and average for midterms is a little lower than 70. I end up pretty much getting similar assignment and exam marks, (high 70s, low 80s last term, and 85ishs this term)."
Good luck! :)

"it's exam season, and I'm on the verge of failing one of my classes. I'm so worried i'll fail. It's proofs and i can't get a jist of them and its making me stressed/anxious. I'm staying up until 4am studying and i'm questioning whether or not i'm up for math anymore :( "
"Sorry to break it to you, but University academics can be pretty unrelenting. But I honestly believe a strong work ethic can put you ahead of everyone else. How you will cope with the change depends entirely on the kind of person *you are*, but success is not out of reach. Some programs require near inhuman levels of effort to keep pace. It comes to the point where the sole focus in your life will become your work. Relationships, sleep, food, anything else comes second to your work.But that's an extreme example ofc."

I've been here for 3 years and still haven't gotten over how out of place I feel at this school. Figuring out how to compete with you geniuses has been the hardest &amp; most stressful part of this whole experience. I'm scared of how much worse it'll get once I graduate... 
"One of my exam marks got posted to LEARN and I did absolutely awful, like 20% lower than what I expected. Not a great motivation to keep studying for my last 2 exams. This term has been so mentally exhaustive. I feel so burnt out from the 2 day gap between co-op and school."

"Hey OP, if you haven't looked into it already I would recommend that you see a physio or a chiro (esp. if you're covered under an extended health care plan)I hope you are feeling better. I know it gets aggravated from sitting too much..but that's the extent of my knowledge"
"I've stopped caring about my coop job, my grades when I'm at school, my physical health, pretty much everything that comprises a decent human being. I used to be able to dispel these thoughts and summon the urge to work when the deadlines draw close, but now my body just refuses to start on the things I don't care about, which is pretty much everything. I've barely been productive at work in the past few weeks and walking in every morning now gives me anxiety because I'm afraid of getting called out by my manager. I've tried talking to friends, taking on new hobbies, reading books, listening to podcasts, but they're just distractions to fill my head that temporarily stops me from thinking about the things that I don't care about and therefore suck. I used to keep going because I'm almost done my undergrad but I'm no longer looking forward to an eternity of the same things ahead. I would be okay with getting fired from my job and dropping out of school right now but there are people in my life that I don't want to let down. Every time a new thing that I have to do pops up, I'm starting to consider just ending my life so I don't have to do it. I want to get professional help, but I don't know how I can be helped when deep down I think I don't really even want help, which is ironic because writing this post is pretty much like a call for help. I don't know what writing this post could change, but it's cool that the UW subreddit has an outlet like this I could use to let out my thoughts and maybe get through this. Thanks for reading."

"&gt; Anybody else ever felt like this?Every. single. day. I think I've come to the conclusion that for some of us, mental illness is just going to be a part of life. We will never have fulfilling relationships or a sense of long-term satisfaction.We're still smart enough to work for society and that's all our purpose is. I go into my little office, I write my little code, and make the company some money. The business guys sit around the table, eat together and share their lives. I'm sitting on my desk, alone. When I'm home, I'm here desperately trying to distract myself from my day-to-day reality.Sometimes, the hardest part about being mentally ill, is being able to tell someone else, ""I'm not okay."" Because what is okay? What's really holding me back from being social, and having a fulfilling life? Nothing. All I have to do, is just do it.But I can't. I just can't. I wish I could just explain what this feels like, what me feels like. This is just who I am. The thought of me being 'normal' feels like a fever-dream."
How difficult is econ
Sorry about your loss
don't forget that just because they weren't the right fit for you doesn't mean they can't make a world of a difference to somebody else. it's important not to let your personal experience be with mental health services be given as a fact to someone who doesn't know any better.

I wrote a makeup exam for a winter term exam on May 6. The marks need to be on quest by May 20 for me to be able to graduate in June but I'm not sure if that will happen because my prof is dealing with a family crisis.

I feel terrible for her and I know the last thing she wants is to mark exams but if I don't graduate in June my mental health will take a serious hit. I'm so anxious I don't know what to do.

"The great thing about university is that now is your chance to make mistakes and learn from them. Sorry for lack of better analogy but its kind of like teaching a dog a trick. They arent going to get it immediately. Doesnt stop them from trying to learn it. Dont give up. Past me used to say that i was hard working. Now i say that im perserverent. I think that the fact that you havent given up yet is very admirable. Its easy to walk away from a challenge but harder to pick yourself up and keep going. Dont beat yourself too much for not feeling confident all the time. No one is born to be confident. Its something you need to find within yourself and sometimes it likes to play hide and seek. This is kind of a throw away account for me but feel free to mssg me if you want to chat. "

May I ask why you feel this way? One of the things I've found personally is that for talk therapy to work, you have to want to change. Because ultimately, you yourself are the only one who is capable of changing the way you think. Personally took me three tries to really get it right.Anyway, if you want someone to chat with either in person or online, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message. Talking about it really does help, so if that's something you're interested in, I'd be more than happy to talk with you. Take care :)"
Easy but I didn't go to class
Good for you.  Also get laid.
This is why I hate having fun
Use your weekends to relax a bit and let loose and blow off steam? Do you have friends nearby/in the city you're at? Maybe a hobby or 2 to throw yourself into? I bought a ukulele for pretty cheap and that's fun to sit down and learn how to play for even just a half hour here and there

Wow you get higher than average on exams but lower on assignments?? I don't understand how thats possible but it sounds like you're doing better than the rest of us in terms of understanding... We get to use all of our notes during assignments so we don't actually *know* the material per-se
"Been having some medical issues for awhile... A couple of weeks ago it got a lot worse (went to the ER)and with the slow medical process, I still don't know what's going on. Now I'm having trouble determining what symptoms are mental and what's actually physically going on inside me. It's so frustrating. All I can think about throughout the day is what to do when I feel bad again. It's my final semester at UW and I want to finish, but I feel stepping back for the semester and taking some time could help as well. I have never had anxiety about school aside from the normal stress any student experiences but at this point I know I'm bringing it onto myself. Being unable to make this decision is crippling my life and I don't know what to do. I know it's up to me but it feels good to type it out. "
"I have a hard time getting myself out of a super productive -&gt; super waste cycle. I'll kill it for 2 days, on the third day I'll start running out of steam and for 2 days after I get virtually nothing done. I wish I was able to keep myself working. On my off days I can't even get around to learning things for the courses that I'm interested in, let alone the boring (to me) math courses I have to take. Exams aren't going to wait for me to get my ass working though, but even telling myself that doesn't help. I've tried blocking reddit and youtube on my computer but I pretty much just find ways around it. I've waned off of the non-messenger parts of Facebook but fb is so uninteresting nowadays I stopped using it mostly because of that.Other things I tell myself to get back to working is &gt;I'm not going to remember the reddit threads or youtube videos I watched when I fail a course.And even that doesn't get me up and working. I thought that having an interest in building things and looking at how things work would help me in engineering but all this work is so exhausting. The only thing that I still give a shit about are projects, and even those have been ruined for me because of how fucking many I've had to do this term (on average 2 projects * 5 courses, &gt;30% weight in each course). So often I've said ""Fuck it, lets just do the absolute bare-minimum for this project"", when my natural inclination is ""what can I put into this project to make it best I can and learn the most as possible?"".This term, for the first time in my university career I realized that I'm not entirely introverted like I thought I was. While I'm most definitely not extroverted I made an effort to be more social and realized that I really do enjoy meeting and talking with people, and going to events when before I would skip all that for video games or sleep. But now that I've realized I do enjoy it, I haven't any bloody time for it. At the same time... I guess I'm lucky. I have my lows but I also have highs, so I don't think I'm depressed. I just feel overwhelmed and my natural reaction seems to be just to escape doing what I need to, which makes things worse.I originally only meant this comment to be that first paragraph. Oops. If you read all this, thanks haha. I just needed to get it out there I guess."

"I like the structure of a working day as well - I have met people who have been successful in applying a 9-5 weekdays only schedule to academics as well, it just requires a lot of willpower (and is sometimes less efficient, since you have to teach yourself stuff instead learning in lecture)"
"Don't worry about what other people went through... Just prioritize yourself with what you want to accomplish. I used to think that way too but I eventually adapted to a mindset that is fixed between not caring about how far ahead others are and trying my best. I'm sorry your parents don't understand the troubles you're going through... I hope the counselor or your friends can provide you the support if they can't. My parents used to be uncaring too but a particular unfortunate event that happened between my sister and parents made them become understanding (and betrayed...). I actually dropped embryo last term... One of the hardest courses I've ever taken IMO. 43% of the class failed the midterm and the majority of students got within 2%-39%. Best of luck on it. And thanks haha, you too. "
"Thanks for the advice, dude. You're right about the ""enabling"" part. The thing is my relationship with my parents used to be much, much worse before I moved to Waterloo because after a while I think they just realized that even if I was drinking or going out with friends every night or walking home by myself at midnight, there wasn't much they could do about it. Dating is the only thing they continue to be unreasonable about, and looking at it from even what I consider a less subjective view, it's just easier to stay quiet about my love life and not deal with all the family stress that will result from breaking the news -- especially because my mom has shown signs that she knows I have a boyfriend, but she's deep in denial and would prefer to stay ignorant.Also good point about the tuition. My parents do pay for a part of it (less than half, I'd say) and when I was younger they always said they looked down on dating because ""boys will distract you from your studies"" and, ""We didn't immigrate to Canada for you guys (my sis and I) to have fun."""

Today's calculus exam was the first time I walked out of an exam thinking ""Wow I really killed that."" Hopefully this trend continues. Earlier this morning I had the mindset of ""If I fail again this term I'm going to drop out or switch out of math."" I don't think my study habits have gotten much better, but I think I'm learning to learn quicker. If that makes sense.Keep your head up guys, I'm trying to keep mine up. :)"
"Hey! You're me from 2011/2012 except I took time off and switched out of my program. It took me about 2 years to get back to normal, mainly because it took a while to learn to get close to people again. In short: I joined some clubs. I took on a part time job. I wish I had gotten more help from counselling services, but Health Services was kick ass. I didn't have much success in renewing old friendships, so I decided to forge new ones. Spring term is good for mood and is quieter on campus, as such it's easier to get involved. Athletics also offers a Move your Mind program via Health Services where they subsidize one athletic program per term for you. For example instructional programs such as dance, lifting, skating, swimming. Best of luck and don't hesitate to PM if you want more info :) "

"Most of my good friends are in my program. I have the unique experience of getting to know and talk to almost everyone in my program, because I made the consistent effort to do so over the 5 years. I had a friend group in 1st year, left because it was toxic, floated around a lot in 2nd and 3rd year before finding another friend group in my class. I had the exact mentality during those 2 years as you say right now when I was sad about not having any real friends. I remember thinking exactly, ""man, everyone is already in a clique, I'll never get in."" I want to say don't worry about it too much, and just be someone that you enjoy being and you'll end up attracting the people that are attracted to your personality. Talking to that one classmate is good. Keep talking to him or her, and talk to other people as well. Meet people and listen to their stories. Learn and be genuinely interested in who they are. Be sociable and friendly, but respect their boundaries. And do this with no expectation of them, and with no remorse if they don't like you as much as you like them. Do this because it's just a better thing to do given the alternative of doing nothing.The other real thing I want to say is that what you do with your life is up to you. I used to think that I was ""above"" drinking. Well, social drinking is an easy way of meeting people, making friends and forming deeper connections with people. You can just use the pretense of drinking as an excuse to hang out. Don't let arbitrary ""rules"" stand in your way. Similarly, I used to be partially invited to things a bunch of times, refuse, and then slowly those invitations became less frequent. I wouldn't return the favour, I wouldn't try to reschedule, I wouldn't accept them because I was scared, or because I had work to do, or I would accept them and sound like an ass about it. These are valuable opportunities to form relationships that you can be squandering. I also realized I wasn't being a great friend. Part of making friends is realizing that it's bidirectional. You have to offer something to other people as well, whether it's your personality or perspective. If you offer something really good to others, laughter, integrity, happiness, support, feel good support, then you can develop stronger bonds than just acquaintances. Finally, having the context of hobbies is a great icebreaker, so be more interesting. Pick up different, new, unique hobbies, like collecting, photography, art, sports, join clubs, join beginner sessions, attend events, talk to people. Make yourself more interesting and offer more as a friend. Invite other people to events you plan. Be genuinely attractive as a person.In the end, finding friends is about putting yourself in a position where you meet and hang out with lots of different people until you find ones that click with you. Who those people are will be completely random, based on what kind of person you are, so you should put yourself in the best position to meet as many people as possible. Be the person that you would want to be friends with, and give it effort, and give it time."

Even though I've done really well on every single one of my midterms(95%) I still feel like I lucked out on all of them and I have no idea what's going on in any of my courses.

I hope my employer doesn't think I'm irresponsible, not sure what to say or how to justify it. So stressed."
"Last term was hell for me, with everyone around me leaving for co-op or currently on co-op.  Had a painful breakup and started sleeping home through every class.  I'm feeling better now this term but with the warmer weather I'm getting a taste of what life used to feel like when I had higher hopes in 1A."
The making friends thread yesterday really made me remember to be more active and try new things. It's hard for me to remember to go out and make all of these amazing memories when I'm so heavily tied up with school.

I know I'm just reiterating what's been said before but I've always found that I work best if it's on something I'm interested in.

There's no such thing without a heavy blow long-term (imo). I do know that its quite difficult to get off of anti-depressants once you are on them. What you feel after you stop taking them is completely normal. There's a ton of other possible side-effects so its pretty common to feel worse after you stop taking them. I don't know how long you've been on them but I wouldn't stop cold turkey. You should consult a doctor if you really want to get off of them, they'll control the dosage and hopefully get you off them."

"This always helped me when I got nervous in interviews:Imagine you already got the job and your coworker came up to your desk to ask a question related to his/her project.

"I know what that feels like, panic attacks can be terrifying :( Are you getting enough sleep? Do you eat and drink water regularly? How much coffee do you drink? Have you noticed any correlations with the environment (ie possible triggers)? If you feel like you're in a place where you want to try to manage it on your own, try mindfulness meditation. It takes a bit of practice to get into it but I've personally found it very helpful for anxiety, especially when I don't know what the source is. I use calm.com but there are a few good ones out there. If they continue or worsen, please consider talking to a physician at health services or someone at counseling. Anxiety can be exhausting to deal with, but there are ways to make it a lot easier. If you want to chat about it, I'm always open to PMs. Take care :) "
"Motivation does not mean shit. When you hear famous celebrities saying stupid shit like, ""I wake up every morning motivated"", just know that its probably not true in the literal sense. Nobody hard-working wakes up every morning wanting to do productive (maybe difficult) things. This is mainly because your brain hates work (unless its for survival) and likes to be lazy and does not take into account long-term repercussions. How productive people stay productive is by initially forcing themselves into doing something, and staying with it long enough so that it becomes routine (like brushing your teeth in the morning or whatever).You have to get used to being uncomfortable. And it may even seem impossible. But it's not (this is coming from a previous chronic procrastinator). You have to keep in mind that the effort that you put into procrastination (like watching 50 episodes of whatever show in one go) can be reversed and channelled into doing productive things. Getting out of your comfort zone is the most critical thing imo to being successful and happy in life. "
"Are you still at the airport? This has happened to me before when I was booked to reach Toronto via New York but didn't have a US Visa. Call your travel agent asap and talk to them (try to find a balance between outrage and reasonableness) - I managed to get new tickets and a rerouting for free (I paid the initial charge but they reimbursed me once I sent them the receipt). I had the same thought as you that it's my own responsibility to check for visas, but there's a pretty good case to be made that they shouldn't just tell you that you can fly through these countries without even a warning of the specific visa requirements.If you are stuck in transit in a country for which you also don't have a visa, then iirc, the airport(/airline's check-in counter) is also liable for allowing you to fly and enter the country without checking that you had a ticket to get out of it, in which case you should talk to the airport staff (you've probably already done this, but raise the issue of why they didn't notify you that your next flight was void until your already landed)IANAL, but there is definitely no harm in trying either of these. Don't threaten to sue, just emphasize the ways that the system failed *you* by not giving you warnings until it was far too late and consequently creating an undue financial burden for you."

"I have to take an English course over a co-op term because I failed the ELPE and I don't have electives before 2B. It costs $1500. It's so much money for a blunder I made while I was sick. I don't even have a co-op for next term yet. With exams coming up and all, I really wish I didn't feel like shit right now."
I work weekends at times as well (either that or Im back at home with my family in another city).

"Get them to 60, study more, and don't worry about how you place compared to your class. If you're still in, you deserve to be here or they'd make it harder to pass.Also, try finding friends close to your skill level to study with. It helps keep you on track, and you both save time when not understanding a topic."
"Thanks for replying. I'm hoping I can start fresh and do better next term. I'm not too sure what kind of side project I should try to make, but at least it'll also give me something to do when I have no one to talk to. Two birds with one stone, eh? I do hope you're right about the co-op, given how happy my parents seemed when I got in. I don't want to let them down.I'm still not sure what to do about the exam, but I'm most likely just going to wing it at this point. I simply don't have the energy for it now, especially since I have to go to work in a few hours."
"Hey Im not you and have limited perspective on your problem. If I were you I would work on significantly changing my environment and getting rid of the people that I am trying to impress. This is probably close to impossible given the way we are all interconnected nowadays.My second choice would be to work on something that truly brings me joy. For me that would mean working out or trying to learn how to play on the piano. Anything. It doesn't matter. It would be my little hobby that wouldn't really matter to others but would personally bring me joy when I see myself progress. This would help me take pride in my 'accomplishments' and appreciate the personal effort I put into them.At the end of the day the problems you are experiencing don't sound too bad. You just sound confused and like you are going through a quarterlife crisis (countless have experienced this before you and countless will experience this after you). Just concentrate on being the best, hangout with friends and family and just live life. The stuff will blow over soonQuit over thinking shit."

I don't know what the deal is. Maybe I'm scared of the workload? Maybe I've just gotten complacent?

"I keep having the thought that people that aren't giving their 110% to change the world, can go fuck themselves. These thoughts were with me in high school as well.. Especially when I saw people going to parties instead of studying hard. Then I think about how privileged I am to be Canadian, (i.e. Be able to get a really good education, high quality of life etc) and not live in a country stricken with poverty and/or corruption.So yeah these types of thoughts have made me really resent the average person.How do I prevent myself from having these types of thoughts?

Is it too much to ask that we get a week where someone's not internet-crying over how they're not making any effort to improve their study/social/sleep habits?

"You absolutely *cannot* coast like that in university. I graduated hs with a 95% average overall and I struggled to obtain an 80 CAV in university. Mostly, this was because I was not prepared for first year. I did not know how to manage my time and how to study, didn't take notes, didn't finish assignments on time, crammed too hard, etc. I didn't learn anything in first year and had to play major catch up. My advice is to focus first year on learning how to actually do homework early, pay attention in lectures, and ACTUALLY GO TO EVERY CLASS. This is all a lot harder than it sounds, especially if like you said you have problems focusing on doing homework. It is very important that you put the effort into overcoming this. **Make use of counselling services if you need to.** University is better than high school in that it is much more rewarding and if you put in the work, you will almost definitely succeed (minus dumb courses and professors).And don't expect to get the same marks here; high school marks are way inflated.But all that said, uni is pretty great in general.

"It might be kind of silly/hypocritical/whatnot for me to offer advice when I've posted in the same thread about very similar feelings, but please talk to someone you trust and/or a professional; distraction does work sometimes, and it's not inherently bad, but it can't be the only thing we use to bring ourselves out of the shitpool that is the depressed part of our brains. Medication won't solve everything, and it might not work for everyone. My personal experience is that it steadies your emotions a little, makes the lows not so low, slows the descent down a little bit. But it doesn't mean don't try it altogether; a lot of therapy/counselling becomes much more effective when you're a little steadier than usual. If you truly have nothing to lose, then just give help from others a shot. Just one last go, yeah? Try it, one step at a time, and after some time you'll find that you've walked miles and miles. Even if that's just venting here every Monday, it's the first step to becoming more comfortable about reactions to your feelings. Maybe the next day, it's family and/or friends you trust. Maybe the next month or next few months, it's going to a counsellor/therapist. Maybe your friends will be there to go grab ice cream with you afterwards and just drive aimlessly around town after your appointment with you, because eating ice cream is better than crying.Life sucks shit sometimes, but hang in there. It's the little things. Like, I'm gonna eat an entire fucking large pizza tonight. I'm gonna go make a pile of leaves and kick it around. I'm gonna take a nice warm shower. I'm going to get out of bed today.

"I just entered Waterloo as a graduate student after finishing my undergraduate degree at another university. My last semester was my worst as I was falling apart at the finish line. I've been booked for an appointment with a doctor about my ""low mood"" after having an initial consultation with someone from counselling. It kind of scares me thinking about having a diagnosis stick to me. I want to get better, but I constantly fall back into the mindset of deflecting work and just pursuing instant gratification. I know I just have to push myself to stay consistent and follow a routine. "
"Think of it this way: you want to give yourself the best shot at each of these interviews, right? But letting yourself get too nervous and worked up will only take away from your ability to be at your best. Don't let you be the one to hurt your performance. You are certainly capable of doing this, and time will pass either way. By the end of all of this, you'll have grown by that much. :)If you need some guidance calming down, try calm.com or headspace. I've found them very useful for relaxing my nervous energy before big exams or performances. Best of luck with your interviews! :D "
"I'm three weeks into taking antidepressants, and I realized I exhibit symptoms of ADHD. After looking into it however, it seems that I don't actually have ADHD because symptoms should have appeared before I was 12 years old. Note that the ADHD symptoms started around 4 years ago, and taking antidepressants caused me to realize (through research) that I've had such symptoms.I'd like to try various ADHD medication (under recommendation from a psychiatrist) to combat these symptoms, as they affect my everyday life, even during recreational activities. However, I'm going to the US in less than 2 weeks for co-op and I'm afraid I won't have the time to get set up with a psychologist/psychiatrist and have multiple appointments, etc. I'm almost positive I wouldn't be able to get the help I need (i.e. doctor's appointments) while I'm in the US."
"Software doesn't guarantee happiness either... for every noogler there's a misguided scrub buried in half baked side projects. It would be better to move on. I guess alcohol is one way of accelerating that process. The healthy way would be yoloing off and overwriting the misery with more fulfilling experiences.Depending on your mindset reminding yourself that in the end we're all going to die from climate change, and so many factors are out of our individual control, and the best we can do is not starve to death while finding small moments of happiness, might also be helpful. Also the first years probably havent figure out where the counselling office is, so dehydrating yourself through your eyeballs in there might help. Unless it doesn't. But your experience sounds way worse than mine... I was mostly just happy to be finally done."

"When I first came to UW, I was coming in from a position where I was either #1 or #2 across the board for science and math courses in my high school. Did well on the math contests, etc etc. When I got here and met people in my program though, it dawned on me that UW is in a league of its own, that my program was full of people like me, and now I was average.It was a really tough thing to process in my brain, and admittedly it made me sad for a bit. But I realized that I needed to focus on myself and my capabilities only. I was used to thriving off of how well I did relative to my peers in high school. But that mindset is unhealthy, even though it was making me feel good in high school since I was on top. Even then I should've been only focused on how I was doing based on my abilities. It takes some effort for sure, but you should try to re-evaluate your expectations for yourself. For me, that meant learning to not freak out if a mark came back below 80%. Or any number for that matter - the important thing is looking at the result compared to what you think you can achieve. Once you understand what you're capable of, set realistic expectations for yourself, and move forward from there. Don't use expectations of your peers for you. Your situation is different from theirs, and you can't correlate the two.Hope that was insightful for you :)"

"Learn statistics. You will see that humans as also being data points that assume a natural distribution curve. No matter what the environment, some will be very successful, some will be shit, and the majority will hover around the median. Though, the skew of that graph may vary depending on factors.How this will help: You will see people as not being the same. You will see them as a random arrangement of genes and environmental stimuli that made them who they are. You will be able to empathize with the full spectrum of humans, from killer and pedophiles all the way up to the Elon Musks."
"One of the things I've been learning in my co ops is that it's okay to say no.

"Well I think it really depends on who you are. Regardless, those two things you mentioned are a must for everyone. Taking notes helps you remember better, and gives you something to look back on if you're struggling. Even when the course is nearly identical to the slides or textbook, your prof will inevitably give a few more details (I did have one prof who didn't do this, but even then it was a good way to stay focused in class).Time management is just as important. You need to be able to do your assignments every week, and have extra time to study. Very few people can spend the whole semester doing assignments and not studying, and then cram at the end and still do well. Maybe for easier electives, but a lot of the time that can be a disastrous strategy. Plan some study time each week, and remember to study especially when you have more time available.Another thing that I would note, is sometimes people feel guilty and ""study"" even when they are feeling exhausted. Most of the time this results in people half ass reading course notes, and getting very little out of it. Going to bed early and going hard the next day, or taking a half hour nap and trying again will return much better results. I still struggle with this, but doing practice questions is almost always the best way to study (At least for courses that aren't memorization based)."

I'm not sure whether delay in writing thesis could be taken as procrastination or as mental health issue. The struggle to sit down and  motivate yourself to start writing is a pain. I keep making targets on post-it's but when it comes to putting it in action I fail miserably. Distractions like 24/7 usage of social media apps is a big negligence towards my progress in finishing my thesis. It's quite hard to shy away from social media nowadays.

"I felt the exact same way about my first year in eng!  Did terrible in my first year, felt like I connected with no one in my classes, and was seriously considering switching out.  Remember that you're not alone in how you feel - certainly there is someone you can talk to over similar experiences.  Plus, your 2A courses might be different.  I found 2A to be way more specialized and interesting, which helped me focus more towards my academics.  At this point too, your class will probably come a bit closer together because you can see who's in for the long haul.  Good luck this term, and don't give up!"
"That's not a logical reason, first of all.Secondly, what you have is not a chicken-and-egg scenario, but rather a death spiral. You think you're shit, therefore you don't want to ""bother"" other people with your shittiness, therefore you feel like even more shit because nobody's interacting with you (because you've isolated yourself in the first place).The solution is to realise that life has value in and of itself. Even if somehow someone were to 100% prove from a materialistic perspective that everyone is better off dead (this is not the case), there will not be a mass suicide. Why? Because all life has value that cannot be quantified, and people feel this. Suicide is a permanent solution to what is really a temporary problem.Furthermore, real friends wouldn't hate you because you're ""shitty"". If you are compassionate and want compassion back, you're not ""shit"". Stop wallowing in self-pity and start working to get yourself to a position where you once again enjoy, or at least tolerate, life.If you want somebody to talk to, unironically PM me. There's no reason why anyone should commit suicide."

"Greetings fellow science major,Here's a quote that has always inspired me through success and failure: ""A scientist is someone whose curiosity survives education's assaults on it."" - Sir Hermann BondiSuccess does not come over night, it is forged upon years of hardwork, failure, and minor successes until it manifests into mastery.Find new methods to study (locations, habits, routines) and more importantly make sure that you are taking time to rest your mind completely from worry (find what makes you feel healthy and calm. eg. sports, nature walking, meditation, whatever it is for you). If you need to talk to someone we have those individuals available at the university to help, please go and see them as this might be very beneficial. Reach out to people on this subreddit and we will gladly talk with you (in private message if needed).I think that one of our major issues in society is that we focus on success in the wrong sense. It is nice to have ambitions but we need to build a stronger community that encourages everyone to succeed without leaving others behind. We all share the same community."

Living in the present is probably dangerous but it's the only thing I seem to be able to do right now
"idk you situation dude, but it might be a good idea to tell them rather then have them find out later"
"AFM right?If so, I really feel sorry since our year is very cliquely. Best approach is that try to make friends with some of the other 'small cliques' or 'randos sitting by themselves' (you might see me if we have AFM 241 together). Also, try to find friends in other (non AFSA related) clubs that does stuff you like doing like dancing or other stuff."
"I would do that, but the kind of services I need are long term high intensity services, the kind that can quickly rack up an annual bill of like $26,000 (or such is the cost of a program in the States, which is quite like the one I'm on a 2 year waiting list for).Essentially I need weekly sessions minimum, until I get to a position where my existence isn't a threat to myself. In the meantime, I just have to keep myself from trying to kill myself in my sleep, which has already happened multiple times. Keep waking up with marks that could have only happened if I attacked myself in my sleep.Counselling Services initially suggested combining that $450 with the additional $2000 I'm eligible for, and realized it still wouldn't be enough to cover me. I'm one of those cases where the monetary cost of fixing me might actually be greater than my value to society."
Damn I was in the same boat too :( I still question if I should continue math losing interest fast....
"Or there's less people here because there's nothing to procrastinate from, but I like the optimism :) "
Study at the library or somewhere else perhaps? That way it feels more like a job and less freelance. 
"That sounds like symptoms of anorexia nervosa.Have you talked to a health professional about it yet?"

"WARNING: Long read, sorry. Felt like I needed to get this out because I relate to this so very much.Are you me? I'm also a biol student (assuming from your name) who's having a similar experience - didn't get a co-op job the first term, and just scraped by with getting a last minute 8-month co-op the next term which also offset me from the other students on the co-op stream leaving me with little choice in courses to take. I study long hours, but never do as good as my peers who spend far less time studying to the point that I feel like I have a learning impediment as I cannot for the life of me remember information. Things were steadily spiraling downhill for me as I got to the point where I was barely getting 50's/failing midterms. I also had chem 266 and completely failed the second midterm (I got like 3/12). I kid you not - one look at the midterm and I actually laughed bitterly to myself as soon as I read the first sentence as it literally looked like a foreign language to me. Things surely enough got to a point where it became a regular thing to cry when I was alone and isolate myself from others as I felt like everyone was in a different world from me. But... I found the smallest of all hopes in myself. Despite miserably failing several midterms, I still managed to pass the courses and I am slowly improving myself - and I know you can do the same (albeit, my grades are not something to be particularly proud about). I had to stop and ask myself: how I can change?A lot of people told me that you shouldn't be in a rush to graduate and I think it is something important to consider. If you think you are unable to handle a certain course load, do not hesitate to drop. Friends are taking 5 courses while you are taking 3? Take a moment to stop and consider only yourself. Take a course load that you are confident you can handle. There is NO rush to graduate especially when you don't have a particular career path in mind. Take the time to learn things at your own pace.I also started reaching out for help. I decided that I would go to counselling services last term for advice on how to cope with my problems. They provided a good pillar of support and prescribed me medication. I am also currently still in the process of being diagnosed with depression/ADHD. Don't take this the wrong way - I know medication doesn't sound like a particularly good idea to use to get around things, but they have actually helped me considerably. One particular medication I was prescribed with tackled anxiety and it literally did wonders for me when I took it during exam period. I also opened up to a friend and my family about my situation and to my surprise, they supported me and it is one of the main things that keep me going. If you don't have anyone, you can hit me up with a PM and we can meet up/chat if you need someone to talk to (warning though: I'm pretty awkward lol).Another thing. Dropping out of co-op does not mean it is the end of the world. There are lots of people I know who dropped out of co-op especially since we have it rough in the job market in our program. Don't sweat it, there will always be opportunities outside of co-op to develop experience. Make changes to your daily schedule to accommodate when you learn best and plan ahead. I have a tendency to fall asleep during the afternoon and so I have moved my study times to evenings and nights. I also need to emphasize that you should always make sure to get enough sleep. There was an exam where I pulled an allnighter for and I literally blanked out for half of it which destroyed my final grade. It seriously affects your memory and anxiety levels. Lastly, learn to understand that it's okay to fail. Don't punish yourself - it only makes things worse. Let go of those regrets and learn to understand that you have tried your best - a feat that is admirable in itself. Finding confidence in yourself is key to moving on. Reward yourself for the little differences you make. Bit by bit you can rebuild yourself and it all begins by changing your negative outlook. You can do it, I believe in you. That's how I'm coping with things right now. I'm doing a little better now. "

My roommate took our shared hamster that I payed for without saying anything (she basically stole him) and I'll never get to see him again so he's basically dead to me. I've been struggling to deal with his empty spot in the apartment and I miss the sound of him running in his wheel and drinking water. Can't wait to finish exams so I can move out already....
"Obviously I can't speak for what's best for you, but if it's at all possible you finish up your term and f**ing graduate, it is soo worth it. School can give some next level stress to some people and you are very close to never having to deal with it again (unless you want to put yourself through grad school haha). Depends on what you're goals are, I guess. If you are just trying to pass and graduate, then, well, you've made it this far and I'd bet that you can accomplish that this term. If you are trying to really do well this term but things have started going south, then maybe a step back is worthwhile. "
Failed my PHYS115 midterm due to stress and anxiety during the actual midterm. Any advice moving forward?

"How do you guys deal with being on term during winter? I feel like I'm doing great now that I'm on co-op and the sun is out, but this winter hit me hard, I barely went to class, I was a shitty roommate and a shitty friend, my average dropped 15%. I'm local so its not like winter is new to me, but I just don't want to get fucked again when winter rolls around."
"Hi Prof. Name, When are you available for me to come take a look at my final exam? Thanks, Other Name"
I am so glad you have Mental Health mondays.. I have found somehow that Mondays are the most difficult :/

Sleeping 10 hours and still being tired is not good :( I hope you'll be okay! Just remember depression is something that can be managed, you just need the right things, whether it be medication or therapy/counselling or exercise or a combination of those! You can beat your depression I promise! "
"That reads a lot better than the one up top I think.

"dp was the first place where i lost it back in first year cuz i didn't know uni would be so hard. all the impressions i got from my older brother were simply that i'd just have to work hard and it'd be okay...but it's not. working hard isn't enough. and I keep breaking down every term because it's not enough and I don't know how to make it enough.when i study with my friends, they go so fast through the problems while i'm left not understanding anything and I just feel like the stupidest turd and i want to leave and hide and cryI wish i could help you but honestly i don't think i can even help myself anymore"

"I feel like I can finally say that I do not have depression after 8 years, although it wasn't too bad until 2-3 years ago. It's not like anything spectacular happened(if anything, there have been some bad events), but I have been starting to feel better for the past few months. For the past few weeks, I have been feeling very happy and confident. Life is good :)"
This is definitely true. I didn't notice until I took some first year courses in third year and it was a joke
interesting. How long does that extend your degree? I've always just assumed 5 courses/term was the way to go

No more having to think about assignments at like 10/11 pm, just hang out with friends or relax. The job itself isn't that hard, but I learn quite a bit and I'm pretty happy with it. "
"take your time and try to remember that not everyone has your best interests in mind. sometimes not even your family or friends... :( I go by this rule: trust someone until they prove themselves to be untrustworthy. If they become unworthy of your trust you will and can find other people who are worthy of your time, attention, and love. Everything will work out."
"Well, it's that time of the term where shit hits the fan and everything's due, and stress levels seem to peak. Here are some of my strategies for keeping calm and productive so i have NO RAGRETS come christmas time. 1. You have a bunch of studying/work to do, which stresses you out, and makes you want to avoid it and procrastinate, sometimes by doing things that feel productive (cleaning, laundry etc.). ALWAYS keep in mind that the more actual work you do, the less stress you will have! Lots of work = lots of stress. Doing work = less work left to do = less stress. Write it down on a sticky note and put it in plain view. 2. Motivate yourself to do the work by making your goals public. Make plans to review/test with other people, which will motivate you to study/do work because showing up with nothing done would be embarrassing. Even studying in a group, most people don't wanna look like the slacker who's wasting their time. 3. Break it down, plan it, and reward yourself when you've completed parts. Remember that we're all only human, and we all need breaks and time off. In the long run, this means we will be the most productive, instead of going for 12h+ days before burning out and then taking days off to recover. Pace yourself!Hope this can help some of you stay healthy through the next month. These are the three things I found the best at keeping me motivated."

I rethink about how I got here and how desperately I want that degree from the university. That gets me going! 
I finally managed to land a coop at the vehicles systems lab in E3. Kinda makes up for the horrible ME115 final 
"I plan on trying to book as soon as I move in.How do I book it? Whats the process like, for a newbie freshman?"
I think I'm addicted to a person. Is this how drug addiction feels like? Because it's the worst feeling on earth
I wish I had done the same. 2 days of break will not be enough considering I have to move in on one of the days 
I'm having a moment when I feel like I just want to start over university and fix everything that I did wrong...
I'm slowly losing it and I don't know what to do about it. At least school is over in 6 months so there's that..
"do stuff... if you're preoccupied with something, you don't have the time to let your depression manifest itself"
"The staff there are really good and understanding. If you want a walk in, you can just go in, go up to the front desk, and ask about it. If you don't think you'll be able to talk with the receptionist, write it out on paper and hand it to them. They'll have you fill out an intake form, where you fill out information like your name, program, year, what issues you're having (they provide checkboxes for common ones IIRC, but it's been a while), and whether or not you feel ""safe"". There is no shame in admitting if you don't.Intake time varies depending on load, but you'll usually have to wait around an hour from my experience. Try to show up early if you want to be seen sooner, generally.If you want (i.e. if your anxiety is so bad you might skip), I can take some time to help you get there. Hit me up in a PM if you want.Remember that the first steps are the hardest."

I think I just got myself a boyfriend. My first boyfriend. This is both thrilling and terrifying. Crap. Now what.
This is my last Monday of the co-op term. I started out really enjoying my work but now I just want it to be over
"I feel so disappointed in myself. This is my third co op and I only got like 4 interviews, and only 2 ranked me. I really wanted a good job next term, but looks like I won't get one.My goal for my co op terms is at least one in Cali, like everyone else. It seems like that might not happen anymore. I feel so envious when I hear people talk about Seattle or the bay area or whatever.But I also think I'm so lost. In like 2 years, I'll graduate and have to work full time, but I don't know what I want out of life, or what makes me happy or anything. Obviously a job should be a big part, but it isn't the only thing in my life. People have hobbies, friends, goals, ambitions, yet I feel like I have nothing like that. I've always been a student, but I won't be pretty soon.On the bright side, I haven't felt depressed lately, but that might just be because I've been so busy."
Anyone ever felt ptsd style residual stress from a tough term?  How do I shake last terms worries from this term..
The only class I'm uncertain about for marks is the one that hasn't released them yet... I feel paralyzed by dread
"I'm only taking 4 courses this semester and I feel like I'm falling behind in all of them. I used to take so much time and effort to finish my assignments and study but lately it feels like my best efforts are not good enough :( I'm honestly beginning to feel  that I might not be able to get this degree, I have no idea how I'm going to make it past the next two years."
I really wanna be in a relationship... is that healthy? I don't wanna be desperate but I also want to fall in love.

"Thanks for the long and thoughtful reply!Your situation certainly does sound almost exactly like mine (it's kinda scary, perhaps we are the same person! xD) I cry pretty much every day or every other day, and have a hard time getting out of bed sometimes... Which only makes things worse... While I'm not super in a rush to graduate, I'm still kind of concerned about it as my twin sister will be graduating before me now (she's in Political Science, non-coop (so much easier holy)) and my great grandma, who is largely funding my university education (though co-op is still necessary as I'm now taking more terms than she thought) is now 93 years old, and I would really like her to see me graduate before she dies... I've thought about going to counselling but I'm not sure it would help... I'd get anxious sitting there for however long and not studying... I'm not so sure I have adhd, but depression is definitely a probability...I've reached out to my family but none of them understand... My mom took Political science in her undergrad and my grandma is too busy to bother with me, and my dad is basically non-existent. I'm the only one in my family who has taken any kind of science degree so none of them really know... When I try to tell them they just brush me off and say ""it's okay don;t worry you'll do fine"" which isn't exactly all that helpful...I've made up a study schedule for myself, though actually sticking to it is proving difficult as I tend to want to curl up in a ball under my blankets and cry for hours and then fall asleep... Theoretically I understand that failing isnt the worst thing ever, but in actuality I don't handle it very well... Growing up I was one of those kids who constantly got 100's or 95's... my average in high school was 96%, so coming to university and getting 70's and 50's and failing things is still pretty hard for me, even though I've been here for like 3 years now... I guess I'll go check out counselling services and see if they can help me somehow... and just put my nose to the grindstone and study my ass off and hope it works out &gt;_&lt;Thanks for the advice, and sorry for all the whining"

"Hey RandomPebble! Don't be so down on yourself. CS 246 can be a really challenging course, and lots of people, CS majors included, struggle. And it makes sense that you're struggling due to how many classes you've missed. You'll still be able to find a co-op job even if you fail as long as over the break, you maybe code up some cool side project to show employers that your grades are not an indication of your skills, which for many people is true! Exam time can be a horrendous time, especially if you've gotten derailed earlier in the term and suddenly feel overwhelmed. I get how you must be feeling, but one thing to remember is no one will be disappointed in you for having an off term. The fact that you were one of the few lucky ones who made the switch to CS means you definitely have it in you! You just have to understand what went wrong this term and come up with a plan for that to not happen again going forward. Failing a course isn't the end of your university career, it's just a learning experience and a brick wall that you sometimes have to hit to make you realize how badly you want to overcome said brick wall.

"i didn't mean to dismiss what you're going thru by saying we're better off than others. i just wanted to put dropping out or not being motivated in perspective. specifically, i wanted to consider the alternative for ourselves. if you or me drops out, we're not in school. how do we work towards our future? how do we improve ourselves and our future potential? it's not entirely clear. school is like, ok, you open a book, answer some questions, and then we're getting paid more and more. boom! we graduate, the job hunt is easier, higher paying jobs are available.in that sense school is so easy. there's no struggle. all we have to do is memorize shit and use our brain. it's easier to do than working out lol, no hard labor. we can procrastinate and go talk to girls and stuff like that. the only thing that's required of us is that we open a book and spend 4 hours in front of a desk each night.hell, we can even work our asses off and then been somewhere amazing. can you imagine having a 99 average and getting a job at google? some dude did that. that's all you gotta do... not everyone has opportunities like that. if we drop out, we close the door on those opportunities, and then what's left is stuff that's truly painful. we see our peers and our friends do well in life, and we wonder why we couldn't do that. we get depressed. we have to work doing something we hate. less money. i think that's a likely scenario. it's terrifying. live in the moment, do what's within your abilities. if you didn't study the last hour, the last day, who cares, we can't do anything about it anymore. just start now. try to prepare a little bit, till you go to bed. then go to bed at a reasonable hour, wake up refreshed tomorrow, and repeat. do what you can do in the moment to help yourself. it might be too late to salvage a class, but there's still half of the term left. and at the end of the day, feel satisfied that you did what you could. but don't give up, and don't lose the strength to get that degree. it's not easy, but like i said, sitting in front of a book and reading it or doing some problems and stuff -- that's not the worst thing in the world."

You're not the only one. Went to a Kygo concert on Friday night. Had pretty bad post-concert depression over the weekend. 
"Seeing my team regularly, even on days when I'm feeling particularly introverted, keeps me from descending into the darker depths of my mind. I've kissed depression once and it was the most terrifying thing that ever happened to me. I cannot imagine the horror that my friends with ongoing depression face in their lives, but I fiercely admire them for still being in the fight."
"I think I am all sorts of fucked up with mental health. The one friend that used to give me reason to be happy has stopped talking to me and I have a tonne more anxiety everyday. I need something for my adhd, bipolar tendencies, and whatever else, but I have too much anxiety to go see a counselor or a doctor. I am on coop far away too so I can't just drop into the counselling services or however that works. The one thing that seems to calm me down most days is just typing my thoughts into a blank notepad. I don't show it to anyone or look at it after but it's just the act of getting my thoughts somewhere that calms me down."
Didn't think Co-op would be this stressful. Also worried about trying to look for a job in the spring for no real reason...
"I'm super stressed out about this week. Interviews, midterms, assignments and PD. What should I do to alleviate the stress?"
There's no drama in my family but I till find myself wanting to stay away from home. There's just less shit to worry about.
"This is me almost everyday now.I find that eating food I like helps, typically something sweet.imo just try to study..."
"Not saying this was the case but sometimes they're only looking for the best, i.e. they do an offer and no ranks. You could've been good, second best, but maybe they're only taking one person. So in normal cirucmstances you would've been ranked, in this case you just happened to be rejected. There are 101 different factors that could be the case, just chin up and keep at it :)"
I mean surrounded by advisers and stuff he can't be that bad. If you live in Canada I don't think you should worry too much.
I'm having such a shitty term... I feel like I just have no friends even though I do... I just feel so socially isolated... 
"Naw, you can just go to counseling services and tell them you want counseling. Doesn't need a reccomend action or anything. "
"I haven't had a semester off in five semesters. I'm burnin' out, y'all. :'( Three more left until I graduate... Wish me luck."
The sun is out and is shining today very brightly. Today is the first day of the term where I'm starting to feel more happy. 
Usually these people also take a course on their co-op term so I believe it's only an extra semester? Not that big of a deal.
"Well I totally misunderstood you lol.Uhh you can say you're good at dealing with people who aren't as knowledgeable as you?"
"exercise, making sure to make room for a social life (social hobbies are good)antidepressants too but those are cheating ;)"
"relevant phdcomic.http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1296actually there are a lot of relevant phdcomics."
"you're right. Getting out does motivate me. but when I get back home, the temptation to do something unproductive sucks me in"
"I am extremely depleted of motivation for studying, and I still have two exams left :/Just want these damn exams to be over."
I think intramurals / social hobbies are more important to our mental health than a lot of UW students would like them to be. 
"I would love a communal study group! Something like hanging out in CSC but for math, would ya show up for something like this?"
"In a similar situation to you, lost in what I want to do. Have you thought about finding a part time job while you're at home?"
"Slowly losing my sanity,but I'm glad that there is a new album by [Conor Oberst.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXjFOmoyQq4)"
"Another week of working on bullshit labs till 11pm. Ive never been in a situation where i work everyday and i always feel like im wasting time.My brother got married this weekend and now its like waterloo is letting me know ""HOW FUCKING DARE YOU ENJOY A FAMILY MOMENT"". Back to the labs with you! Cant wait till the profs all disappointedly shit on us from the low midterm averages."
"I couldn't have said it better than /u/halivera.I just want to emphasize finishing assignments early so that you have time to really learn the material in the course.This is some stuff that works for me:Coming into first year, the biggest thing I wish I knew was not to expect 90s. I thought I would get the same grades with the same amount of work (aka no work). I also wish I knew how to keep an agenda; this is the most useful thing for me to stay ahead of my courses. I use the [bullet journaling](http://bulletjournal.com/) system. Try out different organization techniques. The best one is the one that you will use on a consistent basis.*edit: I also use Power Planner to keep track of my grades because Learn is shiiittttt.*In terms of taking notes, there are a couple different things that I've tried: sectioning off binders, buying different notebooks for each subject, using OneNote via Surface or drawing tablet. The last two are the easiest for me but notebooks are definitely cheaper so I use those. For me, taking notes is mostly important to keep me focused in class. I write down everything the prof says, including stuff s/he makes available online. This is just me. I write down every lecture (date) I miss. It makes me go to class more because I hate seeing this and if I need to get the notes from someone, I know what to ask for. I also READ MY NOTES before working on a relevant assignment. It makes the assignment easier, makes it go by faster, and I've already done a lot of my review for the day. This seems obvious but took me a long time to figure out, lol. Also, invest in a coffee tumbler and torrent your textbooks."
"I feel so down lately. The way that I am, I can't even feel sorry for myself, since I just think that I'm whining for no reason."
"I was so terrified for my exams, but I'm pretty sure I passed them all! I hardly know what to do with myself now that I'm free. "
"It's a snow day, right? Prof didn't show up for my 9:30 class, and haven't seen anything, and paranoia is beginning to set in..."
"Nobody posts about their school work on facebook (or, if your friends do, find friends that understand the point of Facebook...)"
"School, personal issues, friend things, co-op... it's a multitude of things that just keep getting piled on top of one another. "
That's it? I find myself in a constant state of sighing frequently most days :( just gotta power through for a few more weeks...
"I experienced this early on and just asked for more work, usually your boss would be happy to offload some of their crap to you. "
"I go outside. A lot. Don't even have to do anything special, just not being stuck in bed/home for 10 mins in my day does wonders."
"I prefer harsh truths so no need to apologize.I know I can do it, I'm just.. ehhh. Its hard to explain and nobody really cares."
The amount of friends having no idea what the hell their doing in life but still going through it is somewhat comforting to know.
i think that part is unclear and he meant stress of (not being able to go to work) / (going to the hospital) / (getting medicine)
"Motivation is fleeting, you gotta discipline yourself. Set 1 hour a day where you will do your best to get stuff done. The first few days will be unproductive but once the habit builds up, it can be maintained.Plus the fact that you are even considering side projects, I'm gonna guess you want a good job. Which means you aren't satisfied with your current or where you've worked. That should serve as a reminder of what would happen if you don't apply yourself soon to bettering your future prospects.Although doing side projects for the sake of saying you did side projects is also not the best way to go about it IMO, but it's a start"
"Holy shit have the last couple of weeks been a roller coaster of emotions. Starting with feeling cheated cause I had the fire-alarm pulled during the easy CS 135 exam, feeling hopeful because I did good on my econ midterm, feeling angry because I kept doing bad on the math 135 assignments, starting to miss classes and feeling nervous and hopeless, coupled with self-hate for not sleeping the night before to catch up and fucking up the 137 exam, to a feeling of amazement of doing suprisingly good on the math 135 midterm and then having my hopes knocked down and putting doubt in my mind after getting the 137 results, to catching up efficiently (thank you) and doing great on this CS 135 exam which now makes me feel everything would be fine. Oh yeah and I guess business is in there somewhere.Maybe it's because midterms are finally over, but I honestly feel good for the first time since I came here. I'm sure Waterloo would find a way to change that soon though. Damn. It's been a hell^no^pun^intended of a couple of weeks and the journey has just started and I hope it continues! Before I know it, I'll be competing with you guys on Jobmine! "
"Ugh, I keep blanking or fumbling around during technical interviews or questions, and it's really bothering me.. I'm pretty sure I'm capable of answering these questions too, because as soon as I leave the interview or the coding challenge ends, I know what I needed to do to get an optimal solution (if I didn't manage an optimal solution). Sometimes I'm on it, but then it seems like the other interviewees are also.. I just can't seem to focus very well at the task at hand in an interview situation. I guess the only option is to keep on practicing and do more questions, and not treat each interview as a ""do or die"" sort of thing.But yeah, the smallest things can throw me off. For one company, I walked in expecting to be able to choose C++, but they had a laptop with a Java IDE on it, and although the question was fairly straightforward, I was so irked by the fact that I had to use Java that it took a while for me to get the solution they were looking for. The interviewer refused to clarify things and just sat there watching me type, so not sure exactly what they were looking for, cause it felt like talking to a wall.. inb4 culture fit"
Contact the department chair and explain the situation. They can follow up with the TAs and your prof to get your grade submitted.
Yeah I think so. I emailed one of my academic advisors asking about a rewrite and he explicitly said that I can only take it once.

"Hey man, even if you don't get in, you'll do fine. It's a little harder to get your first job without coop, but after that you're golden. Get references from your friends and just start applying places. And in all fairness, if you achieve even *close* to the average you'd need to transfer in, a lot of great places will give you interviews without any experience on your resume at all."
"I have a petition riding on how I do on exam-heavy courses when I have pretty bad exam anxiety. I've been struggling all term and trying to cope via Counseling Services, using AccessAbility, etc., but I already feel like I failed my first final after studying 3 days for it. And with three days to study for two finals on the same day, I just want to cry and give up on life. Fuck 2016."
"I feel u fam. As much as I am thankful for my parents and for what they have done for me, home was just too toxic and full of drama"
It's somewhere between super neat and existentially disturbing just how much better I feel about life in general this time of year.
"I have 5 days, 3 hours, and 18 minutes until I'll be done writing my last exam of undergrad. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's looking gooooood....Only downside is that I'll be spending around 9 of my last 24 hours as an undergrad student in the PAC... the gods of exam scheduling chose to give me the authentic UW experience by scheduling 3 exams within 24 hours. "
"I miss my old friends, and I don't really like some of the ones that are left. Connected with people in my old program after a year but realized we have little in common and I don't care much for how much they care know about school and success and how little they care for having fun. Or maybe we just have different definitions of fun.I've noticed it's been less than a week back and all I do is complaining nanda complain. I want to fix my attitude, but I don't want to just be okay with what I have now because I feel like I'll be settling. I just want to have a good time, by my standards, but it seems like that's too much to ask for. "
"Has anyone read the book The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle?I recently purchased it because I heard it has helped a lot of people."

"&gt; Iダ_m sleeping with this guy off of tinder and Iダ_m pretty sure Iダ_m just being used for sex, How is that not obvious?Maybe start by having some self-respect and stop whoring around, you might feel better.I understand that after a serious relationship you still crave sex regularly but giving yourself away to strangers isn't the solution. That's probably why you feel empty. "
"Holiday periods are depressing for me too. I always spend this time on video games and anime but over years their effectiveness have been diminishing. I realize I have been relying too much on them as my escape mechanism from reality. Periodic personal/academic achievements keep my ""happiness from reality"" levels from going down, but even smallest of failures can initiate a feedback loop of shitty mood, procrastination and bad diet.Starting next term, I wish to allocate part of my time towards some physical activity (winter sucks but fuck it) and making sure I eat and sleep well. It will require some discipline but it is imperative. :)"
"I think it's really good that you're acknowledging the things that you *were* able to achieve this weekend :) Don't forget to count the little victories, too. If I might suggest something, do you have a to-do list? If so, have you tried to break down each item into even smaller steps? What specific things do you have to do to catch up in your courses? Summarize lectures? Read chapters? Review concepts? How about for finding a job? Update your resume? Schedule a practice interview? Attend recruiting sessions? I find that it helps me a lot if I can just take a half hour out of my day to organize everything that I need to do for the week, and write it out in small, achievable steps. Then as you complete each thing, you can cross it off your list and track your progress :) If you're having trouble staying focused, try the pomodoro technique (if you haven't heard of it already). Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break. Try to get up and walk around or stretch, or do something other than looking at the screen. Force yourself to stay focused for the 25 minute time slot, then do whatever you want for the 5 min. Occasionally give yourself a longer break (for snacks, a longer walk, whatever) and eventually, if you want, you can increase the time to 50 min working interval + 10 min rest.Hopefully that was somewhat useful in one way or another. Keep your head up, you're doing great! :) "
I suffer from anxiety attacks when I think about the excessive fees I pay to an institution that vilifies me for being Caucasian male.
"I'm doing alright. This term needs to be over though. I'm getting pretty burnt out. Going back to 4 courses next term, thank goodness."
"I'm aware that I'm more ""well off"" than some others, but that doesn't mean what I'm going through isn't hard for me... Studying becomes hard when it feels like no matter how much I study it still won't be enough... I've always had trouble with chemistry, and have developed serious anxiety about it, especially on exams, and as a result I end up blanking on tests regardless of how many hours or days or months I study... I came to this school so that I wouldn't have to be broke and work retail all the time, and I busted my ass to get here and stay here, and now it's looking like despite all that I'll still be broke and working retail jobs..."
"I understand what you're saying, yeah. Can't hurt to have another set of eyes on it.There are not too many mech jobs total, though :("
"""I'm one of those cases where the monetary cost of fixing me might actually be greater than my value to society.""Don't say that, that's never true. Be kind to yourself, or at least do your best to try.Someone told me if you can get a doctor to prescribe psychiatric or psychological services that some if not all of it is covered by OHIP? I could be wrong, but have you looked into that?"
"I thought I was getting enough sleep (~7-7.5 hours per night), I eat fairly regularily although I think I need to drink more water. I don't think there are any specific triggers.I'll definitely try meditation, it worked a bit a while ago so I'll try to get more into it, thanks for the suggestion! I have a counselling appointment set up so hopefully that will help but it's a while away. "
I understand that most people go to several different counselors before meeting someone who can help them. How does this work with counselling services on campus? I'm not in a financial situation where I can just go to therapists in the area but I don't know if I'll have to have another intake appointment or if I'm even allowed to see a different counselor. I would appreciate any insight.
"yeah I know that feeling :( but if you never trust people and never open up to people you miss out on those who are worthy of your time! :) It's ok to be sad about it. It's normal. I'm not sure if I would call it depression (unless you are diagnosed in which case I wasn't aware), but depression is long term sadness and as long as you are able to move on after a while, you will be okay.

"Gene therapy is poised to be the next revolution in medicine, and arguably science itself. There are many clinical trials around now for extreme cases which make use of older gene therapy techniques, but there are several exciting new ones in the pipeline. If you haven't heard of it, check out CRISPR. Molecular biologists have started to discover libraries of gene modification proteins/systems that bacteria use to defend themselves against viruses -- it's fascinating stuff. It's possible we'll have commonplace treatments for correcting (minor) somatic cell mutations in adult humans within a decade, and viable clinical trials much sooner."
"I am actually excited to be back in school for the winter. My last term, and hopefully my best term there. Wish me luck!See you there."
I felt they were pretty lenient marking 251 last semester.. Quite a few people were convinced they failed (according to the Piazza poll)
I've been referred to a program they have full funding for. I don't want to work with them because last time it was a form of torture...

"At the beginning of my coop term, I told myself that I would spend my free time outside of coop working on side projects and improving my coding skill. Instead I spent all of my time holed up in my room drinking and browsing reddit. All of my energy has slowly drained away.How do you motivate yourself /r/uwaterloo? I have trouble getting out of bed to eat, much less work on sideprojects."
"I know what you mean and totally agree. Co-op is such a grind, and studying is so draining. Everybody should get take some time to unwind"

"I've been trying to get lose my feelings for a crush that I have. It got really bad over this weekend and I know that I am bothering this person. The only time when I stop thinking about this person is when I'm at school because when I'm at home, I really can't do anything but to think about my crush. So right now I'm just camping at school because it's the only place for me to think about anything else. I really don't have any friends to help me with the situation. I just want someone to talk to me about things other than my crush to keep myself distracted because I can easily get distracted and I don't want to think about my crush anymore."
Anyone else get in a low mood after big social events? It's been a week since I got back from a conference and I still haven't recovered. 
I am sad.  I will lose all of my friends after this term.  I will be moving back to china...To my 2million RMB penthouse suite bitches!!!!
It's called existential depression. You have no purpose. This is what happens when you delay marriage and childbearing until 30 years old.
"Try and be confident in your skills, and general program/subject understanding.  If you are lucky, you might be able to do a lot on the spot by just using your reasoning skills.  If you don't do as well as you like it is okay.  It is very possible to recover, and many marking schemes allow for some errors on a given evaluation.  Just stay calm and determined, and use it as an opportunity to see what you need to learn.  In the future if you have a day off I recommend studying the course, even if you don't have a test or something.  A review of the course can do wonders in bringing together ideas you never realized you had picked up from class."
I've had a few interviewers that refused to clarify. They said they want the playing field to be as even as possible for all interviewers. 
"It goes further than that unfortunately. I think I'm too scared to trust anyone, even my closest friends feel distant as a result of that. "
"Not effective because they are putting bandaids on broken arms. And students don't know how to help themselves. Bad upbringing, no culture."
"Yes, sorta. It looks like it'll be a really hot summer which kinda sucks, but I'll survive. Are you going to be studying in the spring too?"
"&gt; always end up getting around ten percent less than the class average (although i usually end up doing average or a little above average on tests and exams)I too noticed this in some of the first/second year math courses. Do you do the assignments individually? That might be why. I think cheating/""excessive collaboration"" is a pretty big issue in those courses and it drives the assignment averages up. I remember whenever I would try to hand something in at the math dropboxes I would have to push through all the people frantically copying off of each other. The fact that you are doing average or above average in your exams is a good sign."
Side effects for these things always vary widely based on your own physical (and mental) condition. Probably best to talk to a professional.
"Ironically, UW kinda helped me with my stress &amp; anxiety. Before I moved here, I was seriously under so much stress from my parents whenever shit happened. Now that I'm independent, I've been feeling great (did extremely well on my midterms).However, I don't know what to do for housing next year. I don't want to go back to my parents but I have no clue what to do when it comes to leasing."
"So been struggling with depression and alcohol for the past few years. Just when I thought things were getting better, one shitty day just seems to send my life into tailspin. I wish it were as easy as one good day bringing me back out of it, but that's not how it's worked so far in my life. This is actually me talking post graduation too. School is not even a stress anymore and I'm still fukt"
"Fucking 6 interviews, 2 midterms this week. Feel like I'm going to explode. How do I not die?EDIT: Just got another one.EDIT2: Anotha one"

"you could go to counselling services, see if you can get a letter of support or at the very least get help with the anxiety and stress issues"
A couple of my friends are pretty much suffering from depression right now. I'm out of province and I feel bad that I can't be there for them.
"Aww :( maybe try counselling on campus? I've heard mixed reviews but it doesn't hurt to try? It's hard I know. If you ever wanna talk, PM me. "

Mine was caffeine, so I ended up cutting it for a while. I'm glad you've got an appointment set up!

"You've hit the nail on the head with both suggestions.  OP:  speak with your counsellor about finding someone else. Reaffirm that it is because you feel like you've done everything you can with your current counsellor.  The person does not need to be a psychiatrist. Rather, they will liaise with the doctors in Health Services to ensure you're getting the medication and the counselling you need."
"I've made a few posts here before and despite everything I've tried, I've basically given up completely on the CS 246 exam tomorrow, and I most likely did badly on all my other exams. Just looking at the notes makes me feel overwhelmed and want to cry, and that's not even trying any practice problems. I skipped far too many classes due to my lack of motivation in school as well as caring for myself (and it doesn't seem to be depression according to the counselor, apparently) and it's too late to understand everything. My mind is telling me that there's no point in stressing over trying to study for this exam if I've already failed the assignment portion of the grade and will have to retake the course anyway. I can't count the number of times I've cried in the past 2 days.I wasn't admitted into CS or co-op when I applied from high school, but I did well in first year and managed to transfer into both (with a bit of a mishap on the co-op side). Now I feel like I didn't deserve to transfer. Some other student would have been much more deserving of it, and I don't know if I'll even be able to stay in co-op or find a job in Spring 2017. Who wants to hire a CS student who can't pass a core CS course?Not to mention that my main support, best friend, and one of the only people I regularly talk to will be unavailable starting tomorrow and for most of my break before next term to deal with her own issues. I'm not looking forward to being alone again, though at least my sister is still around sometimes.Sorry for the longish reply. I'm just so tired of school and I don't want to be a disappointment to the people important to me. But I'm afraid I already am."

"Try doing a web search for the term ""sleep hygiene"".  The concept is to develop good habits that help you sleep well and consistently.  The easiest one is to set yourself a bed time and a pre-bed routine.  If you consistently do the same things right before bed (brush teeth, wash face, turn off your computer, etc.) then your body begins to see that routine as a signal that it's time to shut down."
"Getting my shit together day by day, and it feels really good, despite the dreariness outside right now. The sunny long weekend really helped too!"
I write down my thoughts every night before bed.  It's amazing how much it helps to clear your mind up and helps you relax!  Wishing you the best.

"there's a correlation between depression and Vitamin C deficiency, but that's all &gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009), which included 165 primary articles and 11 systematic reviews, reported that because of significant differences in the quality of the studies conducted, findings regarding vitamin D, calcium, or both nutrients on various health outcomes were inconsistent, and determining a dose-response relationship was difficult. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908269/)Yeah it may help you, but it may not. Some studies say it does and some say it isn't effective.

"Wow, reading this actually made me angry, mainly the part about your mom stating how your love life will play out and banning you from dating. You're not a highschooler anymore. But your parents probably won't get any better at ""letting go"" as long as you keep ""enabling"" them by making them think you are doing exactly what they want. *Eventually* you will have to show them that you're your own person, and when that happens it probably *will* be very upsetting to them. After everything cools down they will either learn to live with it, or they won't, in which case *then* you should decide whether you stop talking to them.The only reason I would find their expectations of you to be *slightly* more reasonable is if they are paying your tuition. In that case they have a bit more say (since you are spending their money) and they probably believe that by dating you'll waste the money they spent on tuition."

All I can hope for is that I cared for it to the best of my ability and that it enjoyed being cared for by me for the past 2 years.Living in a household without much parental support for the past 20 years, I can honestly say my hamster helped me feel like I wouldn't be a soulless, uncaring human being in the future.RIP HAMSTERDAM."
"The thing most students don't understand is that their mental health and HAPPINESS is significantly more important than grades. If your schoolwork is making you stressed or depressed, try taking breaks from studying every 45 minutes, or doing something on your off time to take your mind off of school. I find that a little bit of physical activity every day can make all the difference as well. This could be as little as going for a quick 15 minute jog, to playing soccer or another recreational sport. If there's one thing you should take away from this thread, it's that you should never compromise your happiness or mental health for grades. You come first!"
"Most of you are probably enjoying your time off and relaxing but I really want school to start again. Doing well in school is the only thing I'm good at and I genuinely feel good when I am learning and getting high marks. In fact I would say it's probably the only thing that gives me any sort of happiness. Now that classes are over and it's christmas I don't have the excuse that I'm too busy studying to make friends and do social things. Everybody else going to parties and enjoying their time off makes me really realize I don't have a social life. I'm sitting at home playing video games 10 hours a day and tbh they dont even make me feel good nor do I really enjoy playing them. It really makes me wonder when I graduate how I'm going to face life when I actually have to do things and don't have a pile of textbooks to hide behind and make me feel good cause I got a really high average.

"If civil engineering is dead then what the fuck am I doing? How did we just pick up two profs in the department? How are civil engineering journals still producing content? Why did my school get a grant to do random transportation shit? Arglebargle there are new technologies being developed up all the time, though they might not realize it, being constrained by the codes. Civil engineering is absolutely necessary to prevent the literal collapse of civilization. The career grass is always greener on the other side. A dead field is something like Latin literature, management at McDickles, and accounting. Also wow a hatejerk in broad daylight? The fuck? I can't imagine that going down at any of my previous terms. Maybe they'd prefer being like the bottom 50% of society instead. Also toxic people can happen in any work environment, it depends more on the people you work with than the work you do. Id be happy sticking numbers in a spreadsheet if my coworkers were chill. For every google there's an amazon. &gt; additional input from Justin, who has a real job: it might be stressful, but a lot of other fields are also stressful as well. It's just not apparent to them yet as they has not tried studying in these other fields yet.&gt; many of the other fields that pay more are also much more stressful for that very reason &gt; One bad habit I see very many people do these days is make gross generalizations about people's occupations and the &gt; kind of people who decide to go into them, while having absolutely 0 understanding as to what it is they really do and how hard it can be&gt; one example is teachers. many people think teachers have it easy because they think they only work 10 months out of the year and get extended holidays during christmas and also march break off&gt; as if they only work while they are in the class room with the students&gt; nursing and paramedics are another widely misunderstood profession&gt; many people see them as being overpaid and that they have easy jobs slapping on bandaids, changing bed sheets, driving the ambulance, etc..&gt; its easy to do this because we havent studied the field, nor understand what it is they really doand &gt; Ive worked in the same general field for many years and I like it. Ive done the same kind of work at many different places, and what makes the difference is the people you work with&gt; hell, even here. The people at the Waterloo branch are insufferable, which is why I hate going there. Guelph and Cambridge though are awesome, and its because of the people&gt; my work environment changed drastically too when my old manager got shit canned :)I feel personally that transportation is more interesting than other areas of engineering because it's squishy. Like someone will always hate on your design because every tom dick and harry thinks that they know how to design roads, the design standards (apart from pavement and highways) are kind of loose and the constraints and goals are unique for different projects. but that doesn't really matter... I picked this field because I thought it would be most helpful to society and I still feel that way. But I still run the risk of working for a rubbish firm where i'd rather shoot myself than go into the office one more time. Other interesting fields atm include rehab, &amp; water resources. But like i said it doesn't matter, a good field doesn't necessarily mean a good manager and normal coworkers. "

"Recently I've felt like I've been sliding down a slippery slope where I get no sleep and lose my ability to focus as a result so I have to spend longer doing things, and it never seems to stop. Then because I can barely focus I sit in bed thinking about things i've fucked up and can't sleep... It's quite the vicious circle. Any seniors who went through something similar, how did you manage to break the loop?"
"Well first you have to find a side project that you enjoy working on. Then you have to make it a habit to work on it every few hours with stated goals for what you want to accomplish and only then do you give yourself little rewards - like a half hour of reddit - for finishing the subtasks. Try it. It also helps for motivation to work on your side projects with others, hackathons and the like help with that."

"You're definitely right! I think the hardest thing is to appreciate being in this school because I feel a lot of pressure to keep moving forward, and especially to move faster than everyone else. I think it's just that never been a studious person so my grades are terrible, but I'm really proud of my extracurricular and co-op accomplishments.

I look like two face. Everyone has been telling me that I'm soooo good looking but it seems like bullshit. People are nice to me because I'm a hideous piece of shit and they don't want me to kill myself over that, not wanting blood on their hands. This sounds pathetic and shallow, but I just feel fucking lied to. And that's what hurts. "
"Well the first step is you have to *want* to be better. Otherwise, nothing will change. Are you sick of being at emotional rock bottom yet? Do you get pissed off when you look at happy people and think to yourself ""what the fuck is wrong with these people? Why do they get to be so happy?"". That should be good enough reason to want change. Next is cutting the toxic out of your life. All those girls you're still friends with that you hope to have a shot with one day? Get rid of them. Those friends who use you just for advice because they think you're doctor fucking phil? See ya later. Reddit addiction? Browse for only an hour a day. Video games? An hour a day. Now you have a bunch of holes in your life where toxic shit used to be. Great! Now fill it with good shit. Learn to cook and EAT WELL. Exercise. Go running, go to the gym, whatever tickles your fancy. You'll start feeling and looking better, and guess what? People will notice. And *you'll* notice. Read a book. I mean sit down, and open up a paper book that you want to read and not some stupid english prof wants you to read. I suggest the Mistborn Trillogy. Next, join a group for something that you like. I have no idea what activities you enjoy - photography? Biking? Streaking? Who knows, but fund a group for it. Hell, join a league/hearthstone/WoW/runescape/smash/whatever group on campus and meet people, since a lot of them probably have similar problems. Start to realize you aren't alone in the world. BOOM - now you're feeling better and around people who give a shit about you. Wow! Maybe life is worth living. Maybe I can be happy like those people I used to hate. You'll start seeing results. You'll start getting addicted to bettering yourself. That's the stage I'm at right now. I started going to the gym and I love it. I volunteer. People like to be around me. I don't give a flying fuck about my dating profile and I haven't been with a girl in almost 5 years. Who cares! I'm being me and I love it. Then life gets better and things start happening. But god damn, none of this will *EVER* happen unless you stop being beat to shit and STAND UP to your problems. Stop being a bitch to the world and your mind, because they *love* it. Your mind and the world are dominatrixes, and they have you tied up, bent over, and are dry fisting you with despair. Kick them in the god damn face and start making moves to make yourself happy because you owe yourself that much. "

"Exercise and mindfulness (meditation - try calm.com). You have to realize that health (physical and mental) comes first, because it's the basis of literally everything else in life, including studies. I use mindfulness to practice focusing on the now and what I can do/have control over, instead of letting my mind wander away with ""I should've"" and ""what if"". It also helps shut off your brain before bed (stops that reeling thought process). It takes a while and it's still something I struggle with daily, but it's a start and much better compared to the alternative (for me, bad anxiety and losing sleep/ productivity, like you mentioned). Have a regular sleep schedule and *don't* pull all-nighters (seriously, it's not worth it), especially before exams. Don't nap too much, eat regularly, and exercise until you're tired. If you feel like exercising time is study time lost, watch/listen to a lecture while you run. "

"hey don't be like this. Let me tell you my story. I was admitted to math coop (not CS) and I tried hard but couldn't transfer in 1B and finally was able to transfer in 2A with math at 65 and cs 70 exact. I got in my opinion the best coop job in 2A because of my resume which covered my mid 60 grades and now my resume is 4 times more valuable just because of the things I learned in this job (Full Stack engineer is the job title), keep in mind I was 2A math/bus with mid to high 60s and I got a job which some of my friends in CS with 90 plus average couldn't get. Just keep calm, enjoy your life and have a plan and don't listen to people who dedicate their life to academic excellence only. Grades are important and you shouldn't fail, but please have a plan. If you don't feel like you can't find a job, work on it. Just learn javascript, Ionic and Cordova and I promise you will be fine no matter what happened to CS 246."

"I don't know if it's generally worse than at other schools, but I wouldn't be surprised. The co-op system can be quite stressful and time consuming in an already busy schedule.

"gist of it consciously focusing on present activity instead of obsessively belaboring on what's there left to do or what you should've done, taking on a passive observer role and taking actions accordingly. as for things left to do, scheduling them out explicitly and tracking your progress in meeting those deadlines/requirements (again, passively). hard to describe all of it without sounding superfluous but eh."

"One of the sleep hygiene tricks that I've found really helpful is using a scented hand cream every night right before I get into bed.

"This is my first time participating in one of these, so I might end up just dumping everything all at once. I apologize in advance. I hope you're all having a good Monday, though.I feel dumb even saying this, but sometimes it gets exhausting just being an arts student. My courseload is by no means lighter; it's just geared differently, as in, I have ~1100+ word papers due every week, and my classes are always badly timed (night classes to early mornings), and my testing/midterms have been consistently like, every week since October, and it's exhausting me. And then part of me feels like I can't complain because hey, at least I'm not engineering, and then even as I'm typing this I'm thinking, why are you complaining? It's not like you have to do all the science-y math-y shit that you, you know, *willingly dropped out of after pursuing it for years*, can't complain now. And I can't complain. Because people have it harder. And I just need to suck it up and, like, fucking roll over, how high do you want me to fucking jump? If all my friends jumped off a bridge, they'd all be idiots for following me off in the first place.And then there's a part of me that's lost, the internalization of ""you're never gonna get a job, never gonna make enough money to survive"", and then I feel listless because some of my peers have set goals and things they're interested in and passions they truly want to follow, and I'm just living on a day-by-day basis. I'm just trying to get to the next day. The next hour, even. And part of me wants to find volunteer positions at places but as much as I genuinely love helping and interacting with people, I'm not stable enough to keep up a consistent mood/personality for a work day.

I feel feel you fam keep it going and be dedicated as best as you can be. Try to find things that make you happy in the slightest hopefully you can find something there. 
Walking on campus in the evening by myself makes me so sad because everyone seems to have friends with them all the time while I still haven't made any friends a month in
"honestly, i've already come to accept that i won't even get close to being half as good as i wanted to be. i know i'll never be the best. what brings me down is that it's literally a cycle, every term it's like this, whether in relation to academics or something else. I try really hard to learn from my mistakes but it seems like i make the same ones over and over again even when i think i'm changing it up.i just don't feel like i fit in anywhere and i don't know what i truly want in life. I've felt confident and in control of myself in previous terms, but not right now.thanks for your kind words. they're comforting especially because i feel really lonely this coop term."
1A here. I didn't realize how much good it would do to go back home for Thanksgiving. I feel like being so busy on campus doesn't give me the time to consciously miss it. 
"I feel extremely insecure. I don't know how I act in public. I am scared that I annoy everyone around me, so I don't really talk to anyone. Then they all hate me cause I won't talk to them but I don't talk to them because I know everyone hates me. I am also weird as fuck in real life but I don't know how to fix my eccentricities so I just try to avoid people so they don't have to experience me being weird. Then they think I am a weird loner who hates them cause I avoid them while in reality, I already know they hate me.I don't know if people avoid me at work, are too busy, or think I am weird. Whenever I talk to someone, the conversation is brief,they seem uninterested and I am scared I am annoying them. I just want to know how I am doing at work, its week 3.Why am I fucking everything up? Why do people hate me? In real life, you would never hear me say a word and you could meet me several times I would have said nothing."
"I used to question how i got into loo and whether i would fail out, but I've passed the hardest courses (if barely) and I have no doubts i'll graduate (with mediocre marks)..it's just a question of when. honestly, I haven't even thought about this stuff in a long time and it's so wierd to remember how much those thoughts plagued my mind because bigger questions fill my mind now.now I just worry about non-academic things, like who am I, who do I want to be, what do I want out of life, and how do i fix the parts of me that I don't like...basically what the hell is wrong with me and where the hell do i wanna go? school used to be everything i knew and cared about, but now I care so much more about my identity and my interactions with others and how to make my life worth living.there is a light at the end of the tunnel and i need to figure out what to do when i get there cuz after 23 years, school won't be a priority anymore."

"Adam the PHD says: - only a fifth of engineering phds end up in academia. the other four fifths are in the industry, usually in some flavour of consulting or R&amp;D.  - you get shit on in academia too - if you want more degrees he recommends that getting a masc/meng may help to get up the totem pole faster, and build up knowledge and experience in a specific area of expertise. - most of his friends, who have real jobs, are fairly happy with their jobs.- coop students are at the shit end of the totem pole, which definitely doesn't help... particularly in your case last term- he ended with sort of a cliched ""it gets better""tldr: most jobs probably aren't so soul-sucking "
"I'm having trouble coping with school life. I'm first year and I don't have many friends and are usually by myself. Maybe it's because the people in program I have met, I can't relate to, and not only this, I have trouble dealing with some of my course and I just feel so lonely all the time and so down that I have no one to socialize with her do school with and I see everyone else in my program making friends. It second term and I feel like I'm the only one who hasn't made a good friend. Because of this, it's making me feel really lonely and depressed per say. School and pressure from parents and making it in coop is really making me stressed out as well. I see so many students in an earlier stream with SOO much experience and club positions and landing a great job. It makes me worried because I'm not getting the highest marks or really have much experience but I'm trying so hard and so yea,.... (btw, I know a lot will suggest joining a club or going out, which I've tried)TL;DR: Feeling lonely in my program and feel anxious/depressed about the competition and difficulty of the program I'm in. Don't know if I'm in the right program or if everyone just isolates themselves from me"
"I am in ME. I looked at the undergrad calendar and it doesn't look like there is one this term, but I thought my professor said something about it. I'll ask around a bit more."

"Honest question for those who'd consider themselves in the same boat.. How do you deal with being mediocre?I am in my upper years in CS. I would say most of the people I hang out with stand out, they have exceptional academic performance or a very strong employment record filled with highly sought-after positions. When talking or working on a problem with them they display sharp reasoning and a degree of logical consistency I can't keep up with. I manage to get by, but my grades are shit and my co-op record is unremarkable, and it is really difficult to not hate myself. I know it should be expected at a good university that there will be (maybe many) people who eclipse you, but I've been here for a number of years and I still don't know how I should see myself in light of that.How do others deal with this? I know that many people are in the same boat performance-wise but I have no idea how they might maintain a healthy self-image. I feel overwhelming inferiority for not being at the top and I often feel there is no point to even existing when there are many others who can do what I can do but better. How are other people able to accept themselves in spite of their limitations?"
"I need to let this out in the open. Well, it's Monday.  One month before exams, two months before I start a full time job in a city far from my family and friends; of which truly look amazing on paper.  This job is the sole reason I went to this school.  Friends.  I was reading through a thread where OP realized the number of acquaintances is far larger than their pool of close friends.  I went to a party this weekend full of what I believed were not necessarily close friends, but people I could relate to and talk things out.  Now?  Let's just say I left pretty early.  I have two midterms this week.  Both of which I haven't been going to class for.  School? Who cares just get me out of this flaming inferno.  I used to work out five days a week, I used to play tennis three times a week.  Traded up to smoking a pack a day and ruining my eyes playing videos games and streaming those sweet mindless youtubes.  Of which I feel are giving me cancer far faster than the sticks I've chosen to suck on every hour or so.  I have a nice car (thnx coop), I'm in a relationship with a girl who loves me for who I am and wants to build her life around us.  Bless her heart she's an aspiring lawyer with a GPA of 3 in a 12 point chart.  Do I love her? Maybe.  Would I be torn if we broke up? Likely no.You could call me a student success.  Average grades, great co-op experiences, excellent full time job just waiting for me around the corner.  I feel old, I feel empty.  Walking around campus I feel like I can't relate to anyone around me.  I feel far to deep to get involved.  I gained everything I wanted to achieve here but I feel that I've lost everything that makes me, me.Lecture calls.  This pack of cigarettes is going in the garbage once I walk out of lab.  I can hear the barbells of pac weeping.  Maybe I'll go visit them this afternoon.  This reflection stuff, it's making me feel all tingly inside.Have an excellent week y'all, spring is springing."

"Grad school is funky. Really tests your own confidence when your performance of the stuff you do is related to your own intelligence. I was pushed as a kid that I had to be better/above, and it's taking some strength to push those feelings back when things don't go as expected. The people are nice though which helps, and I'm sure a lot of them feel the same way (I hope?).  Any suggestions on how to not hang on to past mistakes? "
"I completely echo this. This summer was pretty lonely living with randoms and having most of my friends back in the GTA. I'm excited for this term, but I feel like Winter might be even more lonely since I'm off-stream with most of my friends, and I'm worried. I think since coming to Waterloo, I've become even more people-dependent, just since people were everywhere throughout my year in res and I made a ton of close friendships."
"I'm struggling to see the point of (my) life. Every time I try to make myself happy and improve my life, it just blows up in my face.

It amped up my anxiety to insane levels :( It took me a couple of days to finally feel completely like myself again and not have weird intrusive thoughts that people were judging or watching me.Obviously not a bad problem to have... but i'm sad I can't enjoy it anymore. I thought after a couple years I'd be ok again."
My mental health was already kinda rocky then my future FIL (fiance's dad) passed away on Friday. We weren't expecting it. Now it's like I have zero motivation for school even though this is my last term. I have no energy to commute to waterloo for classes. I'm skipping school tomorrow to take my future MIL shopping for the funeral. At least my profs are somewhat understanding and I'm seeing my doctor and counsellor soon enough. 
I read it back in highschool then took shrooms and went hiking. It got me out of a look for quite a while. In fact it's probably the reason my grades returned to their usual self

"It's hard not to do that. I'm sure everyone here compares themselves to everyone else (* everyone else better). The only thing that really helped me was to try and get some perspective.1) Your are a student at an University. You already have it better than most.2) Waterloo is considered one of the best schools for undergrads in many of the majors it offers. Which usually gives you an advantage post graduation.3) Co-op is one of the huge programs at this school that helped make it known worldwide. Even if you aren't in the co-op stream, you still can reap the benefits of going to a 'prestigious' school and can use its name to your advantage.Hopefully that helped a little :)"

"Well if you don't know what you want but are able to do okay in classes despite them perhaps not being your passion, maybe continue on for now but make more effort to test your interests outside of class.  With any luck you find something that sticks.  If you like working with people you can try participating in some campus events / volunteer opportunities / clubs.  I hear Model UN is a good one for that.  Another way to figure it out is to try just reading some literature about things you have thought of trying.  Read a novel on the subject, or a biography so someone who did it.  Anything like that to give you a chance at exposure to new topics that might fit your passion needs.  "

Also Co-op is a good way to figure out what you dislike.  I think another thing to think about is the lifestyle associated with a certain type of work.

These people are trained to give you what will help, whether that's therapy/counseling or medication. Mental health illnesses aren't chronic, so stop thinking of them that way. "

"Still grudging over my ex even though its been more than a year since we broke up. She fell in love with another guy after that and I found his facebook profile yesterday. Broke my heart. I feel stuck. I have no one to fall back to. University is fine, but I can't take her off my mind. Kills my productivity. I miss her. But living with that thought that she misses/loves someone else is unbearable. I don't know what to do. I just feel so sad for myself."
"Try not to feel like you've wasted time here and there. Focus on what you can make out of for the time coming. It's scary because you wouldn't know when you'll make close friends, you wouldn't know if the next assignment/lab will ruin your weekend.It's hard to shake that ""I've wasted time"" feeling away. That's still how I feel about my 2nd year. Some people think a shitty co-op is time wasted. But put yourself in another mindset. Now you know making friends and close friends will help you. After the shitty co-op you know that job within your field is not what you like. You're never closer to what you want. You're already steps ahead of many others that are in similar situations like you. Be proud of yourself for that! You know you're making friends whom you can express your thoughts to, you can still make new friends in class that'll help one another on academics. Don't forget why you're making this extra effort, and things will be better in no time."
"Take a deep breath. First of all, if you're unaware, there are some university entrance bursaries that you can apply for to help alleviate financial stress. I'm unsure of how much they are worth these days, but when I applied in first-year, it was a big help. Secondly, you have your work cut out for you which is a blessing in disguise.  When  you know what you need to accomplish, you can make a detailed plan to help you get there. I'm not in engineering, but from what I can tell from my program and most of my friends, an 80% average in most cases relies on consistent and effective study habits. Keep chugging away at your courses, take good notes, ask a million questions to your prof, start and finish assignments as early as possible, avoid all-nighters, etc etc etc. Thirdly, it sounds like you're worried about coop as well. The way I see it, if you can put up a github account and every few days you add a few files of code where you demonstrate something new that you learned, you'll be better off than most. Don't expect a cali job immediately, but I think that the average pay is about $17/hour for your first coop. If you get more than $14/hour, you'll be able to support yourself without relying on your parents much (if at all). Consistency is necessary to achieve your goals, and many young people don't have the maturity to stick with them. I know you can do this because you've already had the maturity to realize your situation. I wish you the best. "

"Maybe try and take a different perspective on it.  Maybe treat other people's (likely false) lower expectations of you as encouragement.  You can think of it in one of two ways:  You can reassert that you know you are great, and show them how wrong they are; or you can take advantage of the lower expectations to feel less stress trying to live up to false standards.  Use the clearer less stressed mind to focus on actually just doing your personal best.  "
"Advice: Don't think that you're in a race. I know quite a lot of people in Engg/CS who never went to Cali for a coop. And actually, a whole bunch of people that went to Cali decided to settle down in Toronto/KW for full-time jobs. But I also know a whole bunch of people that managed to land full-time jobs in Seattle and the bay area with massive signing bonuses, but I realized that it bothered me only until I stopped caring about it. I changed majors 4 times within the Math Faculty, and I've landed a full-time job but I'm still figuring out what I want from life. My problem is that I like everything. So I've decided to learn what I want as I continue my journey. I believe that there's no shame in that. "
"I understand how you feel, man. I know it's easy to think that literally everyone else has their shit together and that you're the only one who's lost and struggling, like you're broken or incompetent or missing something that everyone else has.

It personally helped me deal with anxiety quite effectively.Even if you reach a point where you feel like there's a mountain of work that seems insurmountable, remember that the *only* way for you to overcome it is to start chipping away at it, no matter how small or how slowly you start.

"Hey /u/ColourfulSkies97, I would definitely recommend going to see her again. It personally took me multiple attempts with three different counselors and psychologists over about 5 years for talk therapy/counseling to really help me. Don't give up. I know it's tiring to mentally fight yourself every single moment of every single day, but don't give up. I would also advise against thinking that antidepressants are an easy fix for everything. They can certainly help, but it's also possible to get similar relief from other treatment methods like mindfulness meditation, especially for mild depressive episodes. These meds can have pretty bad physiological side effects too, and even while you're taking them, you have to continue to put in effort into things like exercise, meditation, and ideally, talk therapy. So you said you've talked with a counselor, but have you seen anyone at health services? For SSRIs and other antidepressants, you need a prescription from a doctor/psychiatrist. They're also the ones that can really help you decide whether the pros outweigh the cons enough to give it a try. Would you mind telling me a little more about what made you consider taking antidepressants? I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but I really do care about your well-being. If it helps, we could meet up in person to chat about stuff. Whatever you're comfortable with :) Let me know if there's anything I can do for you. Take care of yourself :) -laysdays"

"There's nothing wrong with asking someone to avoid using a word in jest or as a minced oath because of uncomfortable experiences. The main problem, I feel, is when you see ""TRIGGER WARNING"" over serious texts (such as articles) as if just seeing a word or a concept used for its intended purpose would cause someone anxiety or emotional pain. One shouldn't have to accommodate such people just to communicate a point which almost everybody would have no problem reading."

"Need social links to keep me from falling into suicidal torment, need to maintain those social links, too depressed to care enough about doing so, too fucked up a past to be able to do so in a normal manner, and rather unintentionally destructive in all relationships of all kinds. Further, close to 20 years of total or near total isolation have taken a toll.If someone were to try to befriend me, they would have to put up with a lot of shit. That's one thing I need in addition to therapy, but because of the degree of harm I'm capable of, and the kinds of people most likely to make an effort to help me, it seems rather unethical.Given that there is a very obvious chicken and egg problem there, it seems abusive to subject someone to myself, and cruel in a sense, as even if a decent friendship spawns from it, I'm still using them to deal with my own issues until I can stand on my feet. Not to mention BPD, so I'm probably likely to be some degree of insufferable anyway."
"I couldn't really get around the idea of graduating later when I started doing worse but at some point I hit the lowest of lows in my self-esteem that I had to open myself up to ideas that I would have never seen myself consider in the past. I admit that I wasn't very confident in counseling after the first few appointments but later I got referred to others who have helped me much better. Just the idea of doing something to make a change made me feel a little better as I had nothing to lose besides a little time.Put things into perspective... I'm positive that your great grandma would rather much prefer you graduate happy and late rather than early and feeling hopeless. Surely she would understand - she seems like a great person. You have to think about yourself sometimes and think about what's best for you. I really hope she lives long enough to see you smile on graduation day no matter what options you take.My parents have also been giving the same sort of advice. They aren't exactly the affectionate type but the thought of them just reassuring me though and being aware of my situation was enough to keep me going. I also had to make it evidently clear that my problem was considerably big to the point I was crying on the phone talking to them about it.I'm essentially your... 3rd twin haha. Nobody in my family is also in sciences so I can't ask them for advice. I was also an A student throughout elementary and high school so seeing my grades plummet to below average after entering university was also a big blow to me. Following through a schedule is actually hard for me too. I sort of forced myself into it and am still trying to persevere... Making the first move to change was probably the most daunting part of it.And naw, it's fine. I whine to others all the time to the point that I can tell when my family/friend start to get irritated lol.EDIT: Oh, I also didn't mean to imply you had ADHD or depression. I was just talking about my suspicions about myself haha."

"Compared to the last year, this term feels like a welcome change (for the most part). I'm more satisfied and content with life than I've ever been before, nailed an awesome job for coop next semester, but the only struggle I have is motivation, especially for schoolwork. While my mental health's mostly improved, it's supremely difficult for me to manage classes and homework and exams and some days it feels like I'm on the brink of feeling overwhelmed again by the grind. "
"For me something that really helps is spending 30 min form time to time with no distractions, just thinking; like no phone, music, books etc. I know that sounds like a waste of time, but after about 20 of just letting myself feel whatever negative feelings I'm having, I find that I stop worrying about that particular thing bc it's like I ""dealt"" with it. And I also get a lot of clarity and kind of figure out what I need to do. I hope you find something that works for you"
"Yeah when I first joined the program, it literally felt like high school. I was surprised to see how ""popular"" some students were among their peers, whereas in my old faculty, nobody knew each other unless they were friends. No need to apologize; it's not your fault haha. I was thinking to myself the other day that at this point (going into 2B), I have not made any close friends in AFM; you know, people that you would hang out with outside of class.  (Technically I hang out with one classmate, though we met on Reddit ironically). I'm happy that I still have some close friends elsewhere in my life, but it's nice to have someone to partner up with during one of the MANY group projects we have, you know?I think you're right that my approach is to start up a conversation with the quieter peeps in our year (I lean introvert as well so win-win). People feel more approachable when they don't have friends bumping into them every 30 seconds lol. I also agree that indirectly making friends in AFM through non-AFSA clubs is my best bet; going to make an effort to attend these things regularly and not flake out like I always do. Always nice to speak to you bro/gal. Maybe one day in 2B you'll meet me IRL and figure out who I am. :)"
Anyone got tips on how to let coop not consume my entire life? I get paid overtime but I work more than the 60 hours max and I always feel the need to work more in order to impress others or even just to do a good job...
I contacted my academic advisor and they contacted the prof and the registrars office. My prof will be back on campus on May 16. She now has until May 27th to mark it which gives her lots of time. I'm less worried now!

I have tried applying with a group of girlfriends before (they all got in and I didn't).I'm going into third year CS and I still haven't been able to participate in one. I feel so far behind everyone else that every time I apply it feels like I am doing it more for the resume and less for the actual fun of the hack.

Sometimes I think the overwhelming majority of 'start-ups' coming out of velocity are miserable failures and the program is nothing more than an elaborate marketing campaign to bring dollars into the university.  Hmmmmmm.
"AFAIK mental health is a serious problem at UW. Counseling services get swamped every term and you'll often have to wait a month or more to get an appointment unless you're having an emergency (like imminent harm to yourself or others). I don't want to sound racist or anything, but there are also a lot of international students or students with internationally-born parents who live under enormous pressure to succeed. Obviously not the case for all international students/first gen Canadians, but it is for some people. The campus is quite dreary, and that doesn't help things either. There's constant construction and little school pride.

Last term I was rejected from HtN for the second time and instead I volunteered which was fun, did my shifts and between them built my first Android app, and visited maker expo. It was great, way more fun than if I had been accepted into HtN. 90% of people never touch thier buggy, hacky projects afterwards anyway, but i still use my app for what I intended to use it for!

"Hmm yeah I suppose that's true... I mean 'm already graduating later than pretty much everyone I know, it's just the extra extra extra late thing that I don't like... It took my mom 6 years to graduate a 4 year degree, but she was raising me and my twin sis and working part time... compared to that I should graduate faster since I don't have two infant babies to look after... But I suppose my great grandma would rather that I graduate happy than not happy even if it does take a bit more time...I cry on the phone to my mom whenever she calls but she always just wants to nag me about how I should be studying more and I can't slack off...

But it's just hard to apply the compassion to myself. I think that's how I'd describe it. But a reminder is good sometimes, it helps ground us, so reading other people say the same can be grounding.

"Pretty much right after I finished high school, I had lost my dad in a car accident. It was really unexpected so obviously I was unprepared for it, and it was also at a time when I pretty much became ""an adult"" in people's eyes so no one really helped me figure out what to do from there. I mean the new friends I had in university didnt really know about it because it's kind of a weird thing to bring up with people you don't know well, but I feel like I never got to properly grieve because I was so distracted by my new university life. Now I'm in 3rd year and I feel like I shouldn't still be so upset by this, but it causes a lot of guilt and anxiety for me, especially guilt because I kind of left my mom in my home town alone when I came to uni. I tried to talk to a few close friends about it before, but I never felt like they understood me. I tried counselling but it felt really uncomfortable, but I am considering going back. Has anyone had a good experience with UW counselling?"
"I can't help but feel anxious about dinner with my parents tonight. At first they really wanted me to come home since it's the long weekend but I told them I didn't want to because I was tired and had other plans (i.e., spending time with my boyfriend whom they have no idea about because they think I'm still 12 and not 21), so then they settled with just having a meal together. But on Saturday night after my mom called me, she didn't hang up right away and I couldn't hang up because my phone glitched out, so she heard me talking to my boyfriend and him apparently saying, ""So where am I gonna go?"" She called me out on it last night and I managed to defuse the situation by lying and saying we were talking on Skype and playing a game together, but still. I really hope she doesn't bring it up tonight.And yeah, I know that I've been a ""legal adult"" for a while and I'm technically allowed to do whatever I want and that they can't control my love life, etc., but it just sucks because I know there's going to be a huge unnecessary shitstorm if they find out, because I've never been allowed to date AND STILL AM NOT ALLOWED -- and according to my mom, the perfect way my love life will play out is to graduate from law school, meet a lawyer/doctor who I'll date for a year, and then we'll get married and I'll start popping out babies. I think most of all I'm just disappointed because I thought my parents were getting better at ""letting go"" now that I've been living on my own for a few years, but now it just feels like I'm in high school all over again. And I was starting to feel like I could tell them about my boyfriend and they would take it okay. But now I'm thinking maybe I should just move far away after this and never talk to them again."

"Actually now that I think of it, I think they were going for the whole ""client is vague and keeps changing their mind, how do you react"" thing.. It was a multi part question, and during the first part I already gave the algorithm that I'd implement for the general case (and actually started that before he stopped me), plus it would easily allow you to configure whatever options they wanted to manipulate, which turned out to be exactly what he wanted me to do for the last part."

"It always sucks when this happens - I believe that's why final marks aren't supposed to be posted until the exams are over (in general, anyway). Sorry man!I'd advise you to request seeing your final - if you think you could have done 20% better, it's possible that there was an error in marking. I once received a final mark of 7% in a class (which was impossible), so I emailed the prof. It turns out that she meant to give me a 77% instead (much more believable). Mistakes happen."

"Yea, but again, I imagine a lot of this being reactionary due to the results and the current situation. Fast-forward 1 year and things should be back to normal. Hope the number of issues won't be as much though in the time period"
I was deeply depressed for around 2 years or so. This is just from my experience but the only way it leaves is if you change your daily way of living/doing things. You have to realize that depression is a state of mind. You should be more focused on eliminating or avoiding the things that are causing the depression. In my case it was my environment and habits. I managed pretty well and now I've gotten to the point where I don't let myself become vulnerable enough to get depressed.
Decided to fight this depression-like hole I feel myself falling into with writing poetry and I think it's working. I make myself write a poem a day and I usually write them at night before bed; I look forward to it every day now.

"I think there's a lot to be said for support groups -- not just the kind where you all sit in a circle and commiserate with one another, but maybe something of a bit more pragmatic flavour. Don't get me wrong, commiseration has its time and place and venting is often very helpful, but I'm thinking more a place to talk about our experiences, say, trying different medication, or just to have a group of people who check up on one another regularly (via texting, fb, reddit, in person, whatever) and look out for each other.  Obviously none of us are certified experts on medicating, or CBT, or anything -- but as a student body I think a support group would be something we could fairly easily set up that might have a very positive impact.

"I smoked too much weed this weekend and it just got me pretty fucked up. It just feels like everything I knew about myself got thrown into the trash.

"each course takes at least 3hrs/week of work on top of 3 hrs of lectures every week.  you were also doing a full time, 40 hr, job.  that's like ~60 hrs of work related shit that you had to do every week.  i definitely can't do that every week.  i think you greatly underestimated the shit you had to do and just got overwhelmed by everythingedit: but i think you are bsing, cuz the school only lets you take 1 course on co-op and you can negotiate with them for 2 if you have an 80+ avg."
"Yeah, UW doesn't offer individual therapy, I wouldn't even say they really offer individual counselling. The most often a student can see a psychologist is 1 appointment every 3 weeks, meanwhile every clinical psychologist is taught that it should be a minimum of an hour a week for any improvement.UW offers ""maintenance"" support in the form of groups, workshops, etc., which isn't conducive to progress for someone with PTSD, or taking your example, relational trauma that comes from continually being reminded that you'll be disowned if you don't pass this term.And good luck getting an appointment with the 1 part-time psychiatrist if you need it.But at least we have a pretty new building to show off all the treatment we don't offer."
"I am on coop and I just got diagnosed with chicken pox. I have no idea how bad its going to get. This morning I fainted because of the stress of not being able to go to work/go to hospital/get medicines.Hopefully it gets better soon"

Maybe it never hit her, maybe it did and you don't know, regardless, as hard as it is you gotta focus on you :)  hopefully a year from now things will be different, but even if not, you just gotta keep chugging along :) "
"At the risk of getting down-voted, I would suggest setting your mind to something else. Prehaps, focus on just acing your exams or some other stuff - the more you think about him/her, the more painful it will be. (Personal Experience). "
Can someone comment on the overall state of student mental health at UW? Is it really as awful ad it seems? Is this due to available resources? Student experience at UW (academic and otherwise)? Is it higher than the general population?

"I'm not looking forward to school term, and I'm not looking forward to co-op term after that, and I'm not looking forward to the rest of this co-op term, which usually means I'm going to run into some depressive spell in a couple weeks."
"Let me explain the value add of what I've added:""Hope your holidays are going well."" - an appropriate intro given the season. Have some tact and wish someone well over their holidays.""Let me know if [two or three time suggestions that suit your schedule] works."" - shows your initiative in suggesting some times. If those times work, it saves them effort from having to come up with something.So you decide to attack my education over something trivial like this? Take a chill pill man."
"What I mean is, if the only reason you want to date a specific person is because you want to be in a relationship, it isn't likely to work out. Be in a relationship for the person and not the relationship status, if you know what I mean."
"Yeah for sure for both, it's just the fact that right now I'm not keeping up with assignments very much so I'm struggling to catch back up with all of them. I kind of did bring it upon myself but *man* it's still a struggle nevertheless."

"Don't over think the lack of success in 'dating game' and don't compare yourself to others in this regard. Sometimes your track record can make you over think and believe that its impossible, leading you to drop out. Don't over think it and just go with the flow. Do you really need a date right now (unless youre a 40 year old lady who wants to have her first child)? Maybe you should work on yourself first by being comfortable with who you are. The best way to do this is by doing what you like. Try hitting the gym.I see this with a lot of peers that never really had much dating success. They treat the opposite gender like some sort of holy grail and when they do try to connect with someone and get rejected their confidence and self value drops and they blame it on themselves. It is pity to see this lapse in thinking. /u/IbaJinx , I really hope this isn't your train of thought. You sound like you lack confidence and are not happy with yourself. In a relationship you need to be prepared to give a bit of yourself to someone else and you dont even have enough for yourself. ""Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit.""Work on making yourself great and don't worry about dating."
"Finished all my assignments due this week at 4am, so I could spend this week studying for midterms and catching up. Set my alarm early saying I'd go to my tutorial for once. Woke up, and my roommate was using the shower, so I said screw it, and went back to sleep. That was 4 hours ago.. gg. Then just now, I realized how I gotta learn how to properly allocate time for assignments. I thought I'd have learned after CS246 that starting CS assignments the night before wasn't a good idea, but I guess doing well in that course didn't really make that sink in.. On top of that, my sleep schedule is super messed up, since for some reason, I can never fall asleep on the weekends. But CS lectures on Tuesday mornings always manage to cure my insomnia, so that's a plus. Ever since Jobmine began, my sleep quality has deteriorated. Before Jobmine, I was sleeping early, waking up on time, and I was on top of things..I think I'll start aiming to hit the gym again, it's been way too long since I last went."
"Every. Single. Day.I don't understand how people can so effortlessly ask such thoughtful, deep questions relating to some theorem or concept learned years ago, when it takes me quadruple the time to even remember it existed at all. Sigh."
"I certainly need others :P If your friends are gonna be driven away by the fact that you're sad and/or negative, they're just shitty friends, you're not the problem :) You shouldn't have to pretend to be someone else around your friends. Sure one or two in a group might be a little less patient and you can try to tone it down around them, but you shouldn't have to be a different person completely. Maybe try opening up to one or two of them in a more one on one setting and see how things go?"
"Ah, can't help with advanced math (could barely do regular calculus), but 136 isn't too bad. Just keep up with assignments and you'll be fine. In the worst case scenario you should be able to drop down a level to regular math, can't you? "
"I try to organize everything that I have to do into a list, and plan out when I'll do all the work I have to do for that week. Helps eliminate the ""I don't have enough time to do this"" anxiety and makes spending time relaxing more relaxing."
"Started having some serious anxiety problems this year, wasn't sure why. Turns out it's caffeine that I started having every day. I dropped coffee/matcha and don't have problems anymore, although I'm probably less productive in the mornings"
Super stressed because it seems like everyone around me has found a co-op placement except me. The JobMine-WaterlooWorks situation isn't exactly helping either. On top of that my marks haven't been great this term so I'm a little depressed.
"When I have a moment like this, I just remember what one of my professors said about quantum mechanics:""Here are all these smart and intelligent people asking intelligent questions, and I'm just sitting here wondering, 'What does q mean?'"""
"below is a link to resources both on and off campus.https://uwaterloo.ca/police/safety-resources/other-resourcesHaving struggled with Mental Health  myself for a lot of years, i encourage anyone struggling to make use of these resources. "
"I honestly believe that school gets easier as the years go by. It's not necessarily that the concepts are easier, but you just become *better* at handling school.I found first year to be very hard, and way too many assignments. It seems like they try to overload everyone with deadlines and work, to see if you can cut it. In 1A/1B four of my courses had weekly assignments. Upper year classes general have 4 assignments a term, which allows you to take the time to understand concepts better."
I agree. Funny that Trump deleted almost everything off of his website about race and religion. And he made a speech saying people from the trans community should be able to use any bathroom they please. This shall be an interesting 4 years. 
"Please do not do anything. There are services that could be extremely helpful to you.Never believe that it is the end... youve honestly only experienced 1/4 of your life. Don't let it discourage you from having a future.You are important."
"It actually really is great. When I fiest thought of the idea I felt kind of alienated because poetry always seems so high and mighty with all of its symbolism. But i reminded myself that poetry is completely limitless and can take on any form. I find writing more one dimensional poems about kings and space allow me to explore a more creative, childish side... it's very, very fun, and a good way to start developing my writing style. I treat it like a personal project; gets my mind off things. "
"I can't shake this feeling that at some point I won't be smart enough to make it anymore at this school. Unlike most I had to work hard to be at the top of my school in high school, and coming here my marks dropped significantly in first semester. I'm doing much better this semester but only after doing a lot more work than before, and I'm worried that as the classes get more difficult, I'll eventually get stuck by not understanding concepts. This feeling is compounded by the fact that every week it takes me quite awhile to do the weekly assignments, but I always end up getting around ten percent less than the class average (although i usually end up doing average or a little above average on tests and exams). I don't know what I'm doing wrong."
"Between breaking up with fuckboy ex, first term jobmine/co-op, taking really hard courses that are stressing me out on top of co-op, and trying to book shit with Counselling Services/AccessAbility when dealing with pre-existing conditions, the last month has literally been one of the most stressful and anger-inducing months I've had here so far. But today everything feels like getting better and things don't hurt as much. Hopefully it keeps going up from here. Any advice would be appreciated. "
"Don't give in to the impostor syndrome.  I felt like that almost every day I was in school, and I was at UWaterloo for 7 years, 2 degrees.  I still feel that way at work sometimes.  The fact is, if you're there, you probably deserve to be there."
Props to you for starting to do that. I feel like a lot of people here don't seem to ask themselves those questions until much later in life and then start having a crisis at the end of their degree which causes a lot more anxiety. Best of luck!
"I found that going to the gym in the morning really helps.  Whenever I'm done a day of work/school/whatever, I have 0 motivation other than to go home and be a lump in front of a computer.  If you work out in the morning, you can get around that."
"Last effort, email first year engineering office people. Bill Owen (bowen@uwaterloo.ca), he is the person you talk to if you fail first year etc. He will have insight into ELPE as well. https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/people-profiles/bill-owen"
"this study in particular is a week long, it's not very guided in that they've simply given me some readings and I fill out a survey tracking my progress. simply using the study as an excuse for something I wanted to investigate for some time now."
"I don't know your situation, but have you tried reaching out to profs to ask about doing research for them? I think it's accepted as a co-op term. [This link]( https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/undergraduate-studies/nserc-undergraduate-student-research-awards) has a little bit more info about paid research terms (I know it's chemistry but I think it still applies), otherwise I think it's possible to get credit for an unpaid position if that's something you'd be able to do financially.Hang in there."
"Keeping yourself busy has been the best way for me. Just do work. If you have some spare time, take a walk outside or go exercise. Even if I don't know what I'll be doing, I'll just go outside first and start walking somewhere. I try to not just be home doing nothing, browsing reddit and playing games or whatever because that's when I feel the most depressed. When I'm feeling lonely, I call up a friend (it's more occupying and more fun than just talking over fb) and just talk about various things "
"I find when I go outside for a walk or if I go out and do something for a couple hours, I come home and feel pretty great/motivated. Go for a walk/run or just go check out some stores at the mall. It works for me, maybe it could help motivate you."
"I just moved in today. My parents just left about 3 minutes ago and I've been in tears. The social and academic aspects of the school are making me feel overwhelmed, and missing my family is just making me feel so sad that my body physically hurts."
"I'm getting really anxious about co-op. I can't miss another one, but it looks like I'm going into continuous again. :(I really hope I can get something good, I don't want my good experience to be cancelled out by something irrelevant or trivial."
What works for me is having obnoxious roommates! I was up until 3:30am last night and they were nice enough to wake me up at 7am with their inability to be regular functioning humans! So I'll be exhausted tonight and hopefully fall asleep earlier! 
"Hey friend, commenting to say that i used to have what i liked to call mid-term life crises every term. Ive slowly come to accept that you cant always be the best. You cant do everything right all the time - even with hardwork. Doesnt mean you stop trying. The most important thing is that you learn from your mistakes and you get better. Sometimes you need to kick yourself down to get back up. Or like a muscle you need to rip yourself to pieces in order to be stronger. And theres no shame in crying. "
"The biggest thing you need to do is get your past behind you. High-school sucked for me too, but I'm doing my best to put it behind me and make university better. I started by unfriending about 200 people on Facebook leaving only the people I feel comfortable around. Maybe you need to take a term off and figure out who you are and who you want to be? Waterloo is a fucking great school, but you won't see that with the self-esteem of a potato. Once you get your confidence, the degree will fly by. :)"
"God I have no idea how long I can still keep my sanity.I've been depressed for almost all of my life and it's just getting worse and worse.One of these days I might just take things into my own hands and hurt someone or myself I don't even know."
"Yeah I agree with everyone else, finding a fun project helps. Other things I do to motivate myself: work in public (like a library), listen to music (as long as I the task at hand isn't super complex). On days I exercise I'm usually more productive."
"hey, I just want to comment to tell you to keep going. im sorry that youre going through this, it sounds really shitty. and I know youre tired, but putting in the effort to get help geniunely will be worth it. my inbox is open if you want to talk :)"
"As they say, *""There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when your body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your unprofitable start-up runs out of grant money.""*"
"I want the ice cream to come to me, not go to the ice creamThe great American dream of a white ice cream van staffed by a man in a blue uniform and white apron, with the tinging bell as it drives along is something I wish to experience before I die"
"Think i might be going through depression, feels like life is going on back home without me, and feels like my life here is very alone. Cant get out of bed a lot of times. Feel very lonely and sad even when im with other people. Not sure what to do. "
ive been crying nonstop for 2 hours since i woke up this morning. i almost had a panic attack for the first time yesterday coz i was so lonely. ive never been in a relationship whatsoever since im afraid heartbreaks would kill me literally and im 21.
"Try to be grateful about even the smallest things. Like today, I bought a french vanilla at timmies and it struck me immediately when i sensed the coffee aroma that i could have as easily been born in a poor family and had to take part time jobs to pay for bills, or worse gotten cancer and had 3 months to live. Instead, I was born and am healthy, now studying at one of the best uni in Canada, having supportive parents so I can enjoy myself a cup of warm coffee. Be grateful, and you'll become happier. "
"I've been thinking about trigger warnings lately since a close friend of mine was sexually assaulted about a month ago. We both play a lot of league and I talk a lot about how I got raped in lane etc. but he says that hearing the word just makes him really uncomfortable now. And I guess it makes sense that it would become a sore point, and that's kind of the original purpose of trigger warnings - to warn people about things like rape that could ""trigger"" them. I know that tumblr-type people misuse it a lot to justify their otherkin identities or whatever and that's really not okay in my opinion, but then if you joke about it too and use otherkins as an excuse then aren't you basically just saying ""they made light of it and are part of the problem, so it's ok if I do the same thing""?I don't know, maybe I'm just too sensitive over it too. I guess I've started being more careful with the language I use since I always have to watch what I say around him. I mean, I don't mind since he is a friend and all."
"signed up for a week-long PSYCH study (part of my course requirements) concerning mindfulness and stress management, incredible how effective it is. can't recall the last time i felt so calm and collected about the very many things i have on my plate."
"Desperately in need of counselling services but my coop is 1 hour away from Waterloo and I end after their close time of 4:30. They don't have anything available for weekends or at least one day during the week where it goes to 6pm. I don't have nearly enough money to pay for my next tuition so paying substantial fees for counselling is out of the question. Honestly for a school that has so much mental health issues they should really improve their services. Wtf do we pay so much money for, map kiosks?"
"Yeah I have a very close friend back home who I can talk to sometimes. But, I want to avoid that topic as much as possible. I don't want this to affect me too much. I put my mind in a lot of things. I am fine for a few days, but every now and then...I just can't help thinking about her and how she quickly gave up and moved on with another guy. I know a year is a lot of time. It's scary just to think it will be the same even next year. I shudder to think it will be. :/ Thanks, this makes me feel better."
I'm looking back a couple terms and I realize I may have been going through depression during that time...is it too late to ask for help? Is there anything that can be done with clearing those grades if I really was experiencing mental health problems?
I get depressed when I realize the fees I pay to the university help promote an ideologically-driven feminist hate campaign against men.  It disappointments me to learn that I'm excluded from scholarships because I don't have a vagina.  I feel vexed when I browse the annual salary disclosure and discover that ivory tower professors who write verbose essays on nothing in particular are paid steep six-figure salaries.  My heart aches when I see Daddy Feridun sell out the school's brand for $$$.  What do? 
"Happens every year after a long weekend for me &gt;_&lt;Oh, I have sleep issues as well, so sometimes I become nocturnal by chance... Forcing yourself to a sleep schedule is what my psychiatrist has advised meEdit: corrected autocorrect being stupid"
"I read like 1/3 of it at the beginning of this term. There was a bit too much spiritual mumbo jumbo for my taste, but it definitely helped me understand better how to live in the moment and not worry about useless shit, which I had a real problem with. "
"Yeah I had to work for that shitty firm. Maybe it's because so many people there were hired after being recently played off for being redundant at their previous company.Thank you for your support harrigan55! I hope all is going well in grad school!"
Taking a cold shower. I can't even count the amount of times its saved me from falling into a bad mood. It just helps me get my shit together from early on in the morning. Also meditation can work wonders for you if you try it for 10 or so minutes a day.
"Hang in there man. No matter how hard it is, just grind your teeth, brace yourself, and keep going. Even if you make mistakes through these few years, in ten years you'll undoubtedly be living a good life and when you look back, you'll be glad to held on."
"ugh, yeah, I won't enjoy the wonderful smells that'll come around...But I think I enjoy the spring/summer atmosphere more. Definitely more cheerful!&amp; yep! This is my last co-op term, so I'll have back-to-back school terms to finish off my undergrad."
"I've been wondering about this for a while. The mental health services on campus leave a lot to be desired - they're understaffed, overbooked, and consequently just don't seem to be very effective. Our school is notorious for the mental health problems so many of its students face.What are some ways in which we as a student body could realistically make a difference? We invest so much money in our education, but it feels as if the university allocates resources everywhere *except* mental health support. "
"The key to positivity, in my experience, is finding a path in sadness. If you feel like you're going to fail, it's usually because you feel like you don't understand something. But if you know what you don't understand, you just need to examine problems of that sort until you feel confident enough to get passing part marks.To put it shortly, I really resonate with the quote ""The man who knows how exactly he will lose knows what he must do to avoid it"". No situation is truly hopeless, given a little time."
